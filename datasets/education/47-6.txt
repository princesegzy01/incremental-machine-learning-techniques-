700 UNIMED students face expulsion over refusal to pay fees
Peter Dada, Akure

The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, Ondo State, Prof. Friday Okonofua, has appealed to parents to pay the school fees of their children and wards so as to save them from being expelled.

Okonofua complained about failure on the part of some students of the institution to pay their school fees. He threatened that the university would not hesitate to take action against such students, particularly those in their final year.

He made this known during the fourth matriculation ceremony of the institution where a total of 550 new students took matriculation oaths.

Okonofua also said that 51 students who got admission to the institution were not matriculated because they were unable to pay their school fees.

He said, “Today, 700 students at various levels in the university have refused to pay their school fees. At the last count, all students in the final year class that would be graduating next year have refused to pay their fees, yet they purport to be taking lectures.

“Parents should know that their children and wards will suffer irreversible consequences, if they fail to pay their school fees because they will not be allowed to receive lectures nor sit for examinations. The university runs largely on the school fees paid by its students. Therefore, failure to pay is a very serious offence that we will not take lightly.”

He also called on the newly matriculated students to face their studies and obey the rules and regulations of the university.
