ACAOSA sets up scholarship for indigent pupils
The old students of Anwar-ul Islam College Agege, Lagos, have unveiled a scholarship fund focused on educating indigent and brilliant students of the college.

This was made known by the President of the school’s Old Student Association, 69/73 set, Mr Taofik Elias, at the ACAOSA Reunion Dinner and Awards Night, held recently at the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors Hall, in Ikeja, Lagos.

Taofik said the aim of the event was to honour those who had distinguished themselves during their time in service to the school and set-up a scholarship fund.

His words, “While preparing for this reunion we went to the school to interview some people in the college and we discovered that some students are unable to pay their tuition and boarding fees. As such, we decided to do a luncheon for students and indigenous people of the society. A token of N50,000 would be given to assist them.

Explaining the details of the scholarship further, the Chairman, Planning Committee, Dr Raphew Balogun, said the scholarship would cover pupils from Jss1 to Jss3. “The money we make from the luncheon would determine how many students we would sponsor. Generally, it is going to be managed by a foundation and we would appoint eminent Nigerians to represent the board and manage the funds.”
