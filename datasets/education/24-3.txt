Montessori education is poorly run in Nigeria – Pogoson
Dayo Ojerinde

The President, Foundation of Montessori Education in Nigeria, Ms Adebimpe Pogoson, has expressed dissatisfaction with the way some schools’ proprietors run Montessori education in the country.

Pogoson , at the annual general meeting of the association in Lagos, said the reason people use the name Montessori was because of the founder of Montessori education, the late Maria Montessori, did not patent her invention.

She said, “A lot of people use that name Montessori because the woman did not patent her name. Unfortunately, you will go to some school environments and you will be wondering why they call such schools Montessori schools.”

The secretary of the association, Mrs Noyenum Emafo, said Montessori education was capable of helping pupils to get the best education.

“We base what we are doing here on three pillars that the AMI itself has, which is to promote Montessori’s legacy, to promote capacity and also expand the outreach base.”
