Ted Odogwu, Kano

The Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital on Monday said it had accepted 49 international undergraduates from three different countries for clinical attachment in various fields of the medical sciences.

The management of the hospital, in a statement released on Sunday, disclosed that most of the undergraduates were medical students, who came for practical attachment.

Also, the hospital accepted 103 Midwifery students from the Kano State College of Nursing and six others from the National Open University of Nigeria for clinical attachment.

Clinical attachment provides opportunities for medical, pharmaceutical and nursing students to acquire practical understanding of medical processes by observing a professor or consultant in the relevant fields.
