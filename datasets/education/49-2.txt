Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has registered 1,205,187 candidates for the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, which is scheduled to take place between Saturday, March 16 and Saturday, March 23, with Lagos and Kaduna states recording the highest registrations of 161,654 and 76,049 candidates, respectively.

The board also said that the phone numbers, which the candidates used for their profile code registration, electronic pin vending and registration for the previous UTME, can only be used for the 2019 UTME by the same candidates, not other persons.

JAMB, in a release issued on Monday from the office of the Registrar, Prof Ishaq Oloyede, also said only accredited Computer-Based Test Centres would do valid UTME registration and serve as examination centres.

The board said, “Previously used numbers for JAMB registrations can only be re-used by the same candidate, not another candidate. A previously used number is a GSM telephone number used for profile code creation, electronic pin vending and registration in previous registration exercises. This can be used for the 2019 registration only by the same candidate.

“The candidate who is using his or her previous number for the second or third time will use the same profile code to purchase the new electronic pin. If the profile code has been forgotten, the candidate can retrieve it through a text message. In other words, the old profile code can be used by the same candidate to procure the new electronic pin.”
