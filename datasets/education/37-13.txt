Dons lament govt’s discrimination against Arts
Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

Some lecturers in Nigerian universities have accused the Federal Government of discriminating against Arts and Humanities courses.

The lecturers, under the aegis of the Faculties of Arts and Humanities Scholars’ Association of Nigerian Universities, made this known during a five-day conference with the theme, ‘Re-Humanising Humanity,’ at the Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijagun, Ogun State,

The President of the association, Prof. Dorothy Oluwagbemi-Jacob, complained that government’s attitude had discouraged a lot of students from willingly choosing Arts and Humanities’ courses in universities.

Oluwagbemi-Jacob, a lecturer at the University of Calabar in Cross River State, lamented that Arts and Humanities had been sidelined over the years by the government in contrast with its regular funding of science and technology.

“Science and technology courses are not the only human disciplines. It is important to have it at the back of our mind that there are problems that science and technology cannot solve and the humanities have roles they play in national and societal development,” Oluwagbemi-Jacob said.

She appealed to government at all levels to adequately fund Arts and Humanities education.

The Vice-Chancellor of TASUED, Prof. Abayomi Arigbabu, urged the lecturers to find a lasting solution to the challenges facing the country.

He also enjoined participants to ensure that the country felt the impact of the conference by suggesting ways out to end the killings in the country.
