Educationist advocates new curriculum
Dayo Ojerinde

An educationist, Mr. Josefu Adeyeni, has called on the Nigerian Educational Research and Development Council to introduce a new curriculum for Nigerian schools.

He made this known in an interview with our correspondent, as he advocated the adoption of the 2001 curriculum as against the 1956 curriculum still being used in Nigeria.

“I teach the process side of learning. Learning is a process and content but, in Nigeria, we do content alone, we are not teaching the process side of learning and that is why the youth in this country are not productive – because we don’t have a productive curriculum,” he said.

Adeyeni said Nigeria needed a new curriculum so that the youths could be productive.

“If you cannot think based on what you are learning then it is not knowledge. The poor reading culture in Nigeria is because the people don’t have thinking culture. Reading is a thinking activity; if you say they don’t read, teach them the thinking culture and you will see them enjoying thinking about what they are reading,” he noted.
