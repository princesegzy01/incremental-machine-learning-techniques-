Cult clashes: Edo to reopen schools after reorganisation
Tare Youdeowei

The Edo State Government says it has completed the reorganisation of administrative structures and verification of the pupils of Ihogbe College and Oba Akenzua Secondary School, both in Benin City, and would soon reopen the schools for regular academic activities.

The schools were shut in April by the then acting Governor, Philip Shaibu, after continuous clashes among rival cults operating in both schools put the lives of the staff and pupils in danger.

The reopening was made public on Thursday by the Special Adviser to the Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, in a statement, noting that a number of changes had been made to restore normalcy to the schools.

“The state government has completed the verification of pupils in the school. This was a painstaking process that ensured that the bad elements among the pupils were identified and necessary measures were taken to rehabilitate them. The committee, which is made up of parents and a non-governmental organisation, is hard at work on these measures.

“In the course of the reorganisation, we changed the administrative staff in the two schools. The principals have been changed and we now have a new team to ensure that the schools are set aright and the issues that led to the closure do not resurface,” Osagie said.

The governor’s aide added that the state government was committed to ensuring that the schools operated to meet the aspiration of its founding fathers, noting that extensive monitoring and evaluation would be undertaken to ensure the reforms in the schools were sustained.
