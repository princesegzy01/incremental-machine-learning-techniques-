Adekunle Peter, Benin

Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has said that 25,000 classroom chairs for pupils are under construction, just as about 75 per cent of public schools in the state have commenced deployment of digital tools in teaching.

The governor also said that about 9,000 teachers had been trained under the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation programme.

Obaseki disclosed this recently, while inspecting Ivbiotor Primary School and Itohan Primary School in Benin City.

He said, “About 75 per cent of our schools are under Edo-BEST and we have 25 per cent to go. We have ordered 25,000 seats for our pupils which is under construction at the Government Science and Technical College and others will come from the Edo Production Centre in the state.

“ Our schools are now well organised and the level of participation of our pupils is high. I am impressed that the training we gave our teachers and administrators is yielding results.”

Obaseki also promised that more schools would benefit from the ongoing reforms implemented through the Edo State Universal Basic Education Board.

“We will deploy more resources to ensure the education sector is transformed. We will strive very hard to ensure the education sector is transformed if I am allowed to use state resources to train our children,” Obaseki said.
