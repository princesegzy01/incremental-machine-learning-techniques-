‘Stop treating schools like business enterprises’
Dayo Ojerinde

The Acting Director, Gem Private School, Mr Hafeez Anjorin, has urged proprietors to stop seeing their schools as a business venture, but as a social service.

Speaking during the school’s 21st anniversary held in Lagos recently, Anjorin said the zeal to contribute towards the growth of the education sector in the country has kept the school going over the past 21 years.

He said, “If we had the mindset of making it a business outfit, I don’t think we would have survived this long. It has not been easy, but the belief that education is a social service has sustained us. In addition, we have qualified and competent teachers who are committed to the vision of the school.”

The Chairman, Parent-Teacher Association of the school, Mr Kayode Adeniyi, reiterated the need for the private sector to join hands with the government to develop the education sector.

Adeniyi said the burden on the Federal and state governments has made it difficult for them to fund the education sector, hence the need for the private sector to contribute their quota to the development of the sector.

“If we keep waiting for the government to do everything for us, we won’t progress. Whatever we are doing is for the benefit of our children,” he noted.

Adeniyi added that the PTA will prioritise the school bus project and the upgrading of the ICT laboratory of the school for the benefit of the pupils.
