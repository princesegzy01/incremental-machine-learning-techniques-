The Academic Staff Union of Universities, Adekunle Ajasin University chapter, Akungba Akoko in Ondo State, have called on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and the security agencies in the state check the rising insecurity in the Ondo North Senatorial District.

The union made this call, following the abduction of lecturers of Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, by unknown gunmen.

In a statement signed by its chairman, Dr. Sola Fayose, on Monday and made available to our correspondent, the union said there was a need for the government to be proactive in addressing the incessant kidnappings, particularly along the Akure-Owo and Akungba Akoko roads.

The letter read in part, “Our Union is constrained to draw your attention to the worrisome stateof the security of lives and property on the Akure-Owo-Akungba highway, which is our regular route to work.

“The incessant nature and unmitigated brazenness with which armed robbers and kidnappers operate on this road are reflectively anarchistic and perilous.

“This untoward developments have negatively affected smooth movements on the road, particularly to our work place to ply our trade. To say the least, our members, staff and students of AAUA and other commuters now live in perpetual fear of any eventuality while plying the road”.

“We, therefore, call on Mr. Governor to use his good office as the Chief Security Officer of the state to take urgent and drastic measures to address this ugly situation.”

Similarly, the Association of Retired Staff of the Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, Ondo State called on the state government to do more in tackling kidnapping in the state.
