Organisation donates building to Osun school
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Orangun of OkeIla, Oba Adedokun Abolarin, has urged well meaning Nigerians to continue to support efforts aimed at providing quality education to the less privileged.

Abolarin spoke at the commissioning of a building donated by Grooming Centre, Lagos, to Abolarin College, OkeIla, which also marked his 60th birthday.

He said, “What we are doing here today is to secure the future of these young Nigerians. These children represent our future and if we fail to help them now, they will become those who will disturb our own children in the nearest future. These are children of the poor, gathered from all parts of the country and we are trying to make them somebody.

“The problem we have in this country is that we make the poor suffer more and those who are supposed to help are selfish, they only care about themselves. I urge you students of Abolarin College not to forget the poor when you reach your peak.

“I thank those who have been helping and I hope they will continue to do so. My royalty is ministerial and I am always committed to helping the needy. I spend more than N400,000 every month feeding them. I will not stop helping and I pray Almighty God continues to provide.”

Also, the Chancellor, Lead City University, Prof.BabajideOwoeye, commended the royal father for providing free and quality education for the indigent citizens of the country and promised to equip the school’s library.
