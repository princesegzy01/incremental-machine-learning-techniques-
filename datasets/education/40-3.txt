2019 UTME: JAMB reschedules printing of exam slips to April 4
The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board have rescheduled the printing of the 2019/2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination slip to Thursday, April 4.

JAMB’s Head of Media and Publicity, Dr Fabian Benjamin disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Abuja.

NAN reports that the printing of the examination slips was initially scheduled to begin on Tuesday, April 2.

Benjamin said the shift in date came after 14 Computer-Based Tests centres were on Monday, suspended due to infractions during the board’s conduct of Mock UTME, including an incident where JAMB staff were attacked at one of its centres.

“The suspension has caused some distortion in the initial arrangement and the board will have to relocate candidates who were scheduled to write (the examination) in the affected centres to other suitable centres.

“We all know that one of the essence of the mock exercise was to check the level of preparedness of not only candidates but also centres that keep to the rules and regulations of the board.

“It is to check on centres that are desperate to cheat and to make sure that they do not achieve their aim.

“Immediately after the exercise yesterday, we went into a meeting and examined the conduct of the exercise, identified the structural problems and made adjustments immediately.

“We want to ensure no centre fails during the conduct of the exercise.

“So we need today and tomorrow to redistribute the candidates affected by these suspended centres who had planned to extort them, defraud and frustrate the system, to centres that are more suitable, then printing can begin Thursday. ”

He apologised to all candidates of the examination for the inconvenience caused, adding that the board’s intention remained to give its best and ensure a hitch-free and successful exercise.
