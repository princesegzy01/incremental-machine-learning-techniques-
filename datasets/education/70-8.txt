Olufemi Atoyebi

A 300-level Mathematics and Computer Science student of the University of Southampton, United Kingdom, Miss Tolulope Ogunremi, has donated 350 Mathematics textbooks worth N500,000 to pupils of the Community High School, Ajara in Ibadan, Oyo State.

Ogunremi also promised to pay the tuition fees of five outstanding JSS3 pupils in the school till they write their final examinations at senior secondary school level.

She said, “I am here because I felt the need to empower pupils by providing relevant resources. Better knowledge of Mathematics will never be a waste. I hope that the donation of these textbooks will inspire you all to do better in your studies, especially in Mathematics.

“I am passionate about empowering young people of African descent to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. I will also launch Project Hezi soon. The project is about improving the state of education in Nigeria. The word ‘Hezi’ Basque means to educate and I am setting out to improve the state of education in Nigeria.”

The donor’s father, Mr Taiwo Ogunremi, said his daughter initiated the move after paying a visit to Nigeria and doing an assessment of some pupils in secondary schools.

Permanent Secretary, Oyo State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Mrs Ibironke Fatoki, who was present at the book presentation, thanked the donor and family for coming to the aide of the pupils.
