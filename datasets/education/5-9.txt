Dayo Ojerinde

The Coordinator of Rising Star Writing Competition and Awards, Ms Uche Udoji, has called on stakeholders in the education sector to invest resources and time in writing and reading competitions.

Udoji made the call while presenting awards to the winners of the fourth edition of Rising Star Writing Competition.

She urged the federal and state governments as well as other stakeholders in the education sector to invest in the education sector to revive the sector.

“We call on the government and their agencies, NGOs, the International community and all stakeholders in education to invest more time and resources to ensure that reading and writing is sustained through fun activities. We urge everyone to embrace the noble project of investing in writing which inspires children to have a voice.

“We are not only to giving awards to deserving winners but also to inspire every child who desires to be a writer to pick up and develop their writing skills as well as discover new talents in writing. I see in these children, young writers becoming poets, playwrights, novelists, and editors in the nearest future,” Udoji said.

The wife of the Managing Director, Greenlife Pharmaceuticals Limited, Mrs Ifeoma Nwosu, said it was unfortunate that education in Nigeria is neglected and people prefer to invest in things that do not add value to society.
