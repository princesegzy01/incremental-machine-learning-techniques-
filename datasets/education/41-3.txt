A professor of Biotechnology at the Covenant University in Ota, Ogun State, Olawole Obembe, on Friday, said the impact of plant biotechnology could help in achieving some of the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as strengthening human development capabilities.

Obembe, while delivering the 19th inaugural lecture of the university on the topic, ‘Subdue and Dominate the Earth: Plant Biotechnology for Sustainable Development, said investment in plant biotechnology could help African countries to achieve five of the SDGs.

“The development and adoption of biotechnologies and products in African countries will go a long way in contributing to the achievement of five SDGs under consideration; no poverty, zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, quality education and decent work and economic growth. It is envisioned that the availability of genetically-modified seeds with stacked traits of insect resistance and herbicide tolerance would improve African agricultural productivity tremendously.

“Apart from the recent novel application of plant biotechnology to engineer plants to manufacture recombinant products leading to trained personnel and improved agricultural productivity will also lead to increase in the demand for paid labour, especially women, thereby creating new jobs for the rural women,” Obembe said.

He added that the development of institutional, national and regional capacities in plant molecular farming would contribute to the overall development goals of the region.
