PCU admits pioneer students
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

Precious Cornerstone University, Ibadan, Oyo State, has admitted its pioneer students into degree programmes in the institution.

The faith-based university admitted 90 students who the Pro-Chancellor of the university, Dr Bayo Adegoke, said would be moulded into “generals in the Lord’s army.”

This was made known during a welcome party held to usher the new students to the institution.

At the ceremony, the institution’s promoter, Bishop Francis Oke promised to make the university achieve ivy league standard.

He said, “We will leave no stone unturned to make PCU be in the league of Harvard, Oxford or Reading universities. The students will be academically, intellectually and morally sound. We want it to be a world-class institution where the system works. Management members are core professionals in their fields. Everything must be by merit.”

In his message, Bishop Mike Bamidele of Victory Life Ministries International, Ilesa, Osun State, charged the students to be solutions to societal problems.

“The world is looking for men with skills who can provide answers to the problems of life. Have a vision of the kind of result you will have. Lay a solid foundation at the beginning. Commit yourself to God. Be determined, you will become a cornerstone in many endeavours.”

The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Julius Oloke, said the school would give the best to the students.
