Special pupils boycott Lagos BECE CBT

The Registrar and Director of the Lagos State Examination Board, Dr Oluwafemi Hassan, has disclosed that even though the board made provisions for special pupils, its just-concluded computer-based Basic Education Certificate Examination experienced no patronage from them.

Hassan made this known on Monday during the inauguration of the examination for the placement of pupils into the model and special schools in the state.

He said, “We are now falling in line with the world, just as a 21st-century ministry should be. We randomise question and answer options 13,000 times unlike other examination bodies in the country. We also made provision for the special children.

“Unfortunately, none of them opted for the CBT examination. We have computers designated for the virtually impaired candidates but none of them opted for that option.”

In the same vein, the Permanent Secretary of the Lagos State Ministry of Education, Mrs Olatokunboh Adeleye, advised pupils to choose the CBT option, saying that it will help to improve the quality of education in the state.

She also urged parents to encourage their children to opt for CBT. “The CBT examination is very necessary at this point of their lives. It will enhance the quality of education they get. The pupils in Lagos schools are smart kids, they need this sort of examination to maintain their smartness,” she said.
