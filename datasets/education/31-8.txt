5,000 Lagos pupils get free education
Eric Dumo

A Non-governmental organisation, Joy of The Whole Earth, has given free education to over 5,000 pupils across various communities in Lagos State.

The group, which has been training youths in various skills since 2009 through the Community Member Promotion project, has also given out loans to more than 2,000 persons living in the Ibeju-Lekki area of the state.

Revealing that the foundation’s vision was to have free education programmes in every local government area of the country in the next five years, the founder, Fortunate Gbekeleoluwa, said temporary structures had been built to enable the less privileged to gain entry into government schools.

He said, “Since God gave us this vision to render assistance to members of the public in 2009, the foundation has given free education to over 5,000 pupils in Nigeria. Our vision is to have this free education programme in each local government of Nigeria within the next five years.

“We believe that God who made the schools we are presently operating in possible will empower us to help more children to go to school. We want all kind-hearted individuals, organisations and government to work with us to establish free primary and secondary schools so that more children can have a chance to acquire education.”
