Foundation donates equipment to Makoko school
A Non-governmental organisation, the Herbert Onyewumbu Wigwe Foundation, has donated educational and health equipment to schools in Makoko, a community in Lagos State.

The foundation said the gesture was part of its corporate social responsibility, which includes catering to the educational and health needs of the pupils around the community.

Speaking during the presentation at Hope Centre School on Wednesday, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, HOW Foundation, Mrs Antonia Ally, said the health materials were meant to help the children to prevent and combat malaria, in line with the celebration of World Malaria Day.

She added that the foundation was committed to the development of every child in the country through programmes aimed at supporting them to achieve their career goals.

She said, “For nine months, we have been sharing the passion of driving youth development with leadership and mentorship programmes initiated to support the Nigerian child towards achieving greatness in their careers choices.

“Today, we are distributing educational materials and equipment to the pupils in the schools around Makoko community. Over 2,000 free mosquito nets, 4,000 free medicines for preventing and curing malaria, while sensitising them on the proper use of the nets and proper malaria prevention habits.”

The traditional ruler of the community, Baale Jeje Ayinde, thanked the foundation for bringing the initiative to their community and told members of his community to put to practice what they had been taught on malaria prevention techniques.
