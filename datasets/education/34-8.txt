A Non-Governmental Organisation, Kakaaki Ijebu Voice, has appealed to the Governor-elect of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun, to pay the 30 months salaries owed to the staff of Tai Solarin College of Education, upon assumption of office to enable the members of live normal lives.

The organisation also called on the incoming government in the state to accelerate the development of the state by following the legacy of the first civilian governor, Chief Bisi Onabanjo, who substantially developed every part of the state during his tenure.

The organisation, which made this known at a briefing held in Ilorin on Tuesday, through its National Coordinator, Rotimi Oduyoye, and the Publicity Secretary, Olu Olawemimo, said it behoved on it to set the agenda for the new administration to ensure the needs of the people are met.

Oduoye said, “As much as we understand the herculean task ahead, expect this government to pay Tai Solarin College of Education staff salaries lingering for over 30 months. We expect the government to focus on the cleanliness of the environment; refuse dumps on the street should be things of the past, particularly in Ogun East Senatorial District.

“We urge the governor-elect to follow the legacy of the first civilian governor of the state, Chief Bisi Onabanjo, in developing all divisions in the state and even surpass his legacy. We also charge him to consider youth and women empowerment as a priority.”
