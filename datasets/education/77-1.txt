Al-Makura inaugurates NASPOLY hostels
Umar Muhammed, Lafia

Governor Umaru Al-Makura of Nasarawa State on Monday inaugurated the male and female hostels at the Nasarawa State Polytechnic, Lafia, following a protest led by some alumni over the non-accreditation of all the courses offered by the institution and the lack of accommodation for its students.

The Commissioner of Education, Mr. Aliyu Ahmed, who represented the governor, made this known during the inauguration of the hostels in the state capital.

Addressing the students of NASPOLY at the event, Ahmed said the government had concluded arrangement to ensure that all the courses offered by the institution are approved without delay and to avoid a further breakdown of law and order in the state.

He said, “One of the complaints of the Students Union Government of the polytechnic is that hostels built by the state government should be handed over to the management of the institution for allocation. We promised to contact the consultant handling the project and instruct him to hand over the keys for onward submission to the polytechnic.”

On why both male and female hostels had not been put into use, Ahmed explained that when the governor visited the institution recently, he discovered that the edifices needed perimeter fencing to ensure the safety of lives and properties of the students.

According to him, the aim of the building is to solve the problem of accommodation being faced by the students across the three tertiary institutions in the state, namely Nasarawa State polytechnic, Lafia; College of Education, Akwanga and College of Agriculture, Lafia.
