The Minister of Education, Mr Adamu Adamu, has stressed the need for universities in the country to internalise their curriculum to meet up with current realities and also network with other universities around the globe.

Adamu who was represented by a Director at the National Universities Commission, Dr Christopher Maiyaki, said this during the opening ceremony of the maiden edition of the University of Lagos’ International week held on Monday.

The Education Minister said, “Universities must demonstrate attributes that make it truly international. We believe that this conference will allow Nigerian universities to gain knowledge of some of the best practices emerging from other parts of the world so that we can reposition our universities and create an ecosystem that will make internalisation to truly thrive in our shores.”
