UNILORIN alumni donate hostel
Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin

The alumni association of the institution has donated a 42-bed female hostel.

The Alumni Association of the University of Ilorin, Kwara State, has donated a 42-bed female hostel, in a move aimed at resolving the accommodation challenge facing the students of the institution.

The hostel, which is the second facility to be donated by the association, was commissioned last Friday on the main campus of the university.

At the event, the National President of the University of Ilorin Alumni Association, Dr Rhoda Oduwaiye said the association would continue to do its best to tackle the challenge posed by the shortage of accommodation in the institution.

“The association will continue to give its maximum support to the university and pursue the UNILORIN project to a logical conclusion, as well as maintain our second to none position among Nigerian universities. We are very proud that UNILORIN was the only university in session throughout the country when others closed their doors to students,” Oduwaiye said.

The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Sulayman Abdulkareem, in his address, appreciated the association for conceiving the project and for working tirelessly to ensure its completion in record time.

He also called for more of such projects and collaboration from individuals and organisations to reduce the population of students who live off-campus, as well as to supplement the dwindling revenue made available by the government to meet the infrastructural needs of the university.
