Peter Dada, Akure

The Ondo State Government has said that it will merge the state-owned School of Nursing and Midwifery with the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, to enable the students to continue their medical studies and obtain degree certificates.

The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro, stated this at the matriculation ceremony of the Ondo State School of Health Technology.

About 1,006 students were matriculated into various departments of the school for the 2017/2018 academic session.

The commissioner, who was represented at the ceremony by the Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Health, Dr. Taye Oni, said that total overhaul was ongoing in the state health sector to enable the health students to get engaged after their graduation.

Adegbenro urged the matriculating students to focus on their academic targets and not get distracted.

He said, “You must know that health is wealth, but this wealth is about making impacts and giving comfort to people. It is when you are hardworking and build on your skills that money will naturally come.”

In his remarks, the Principal of the Ondo State School of Health Technology, Dr. Felix Olawoye, said the school had zero tolerance for vices, including cultism, hooliganism and examination malpractices.

He noted that the school was established to provide low and middle-level manpower in the health sector to drive laudable health programmes, warning the new students that it would not hesitate to wield the big stick on anyone who violated rules and regulations.
