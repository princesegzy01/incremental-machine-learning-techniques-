Adekunle Peter, Benin

For alleged involvement in examination malpractice in the 2018 West African Senior School Certificate Examination, the Edo State Government has suspended 28 principals of public senior secondary schools in the state.

The Commissioner for Education, Emmanuel Agbale, made this known in a memo to the state’s Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, where he said that 28 private secondary also faced the threat of being deregistered or de-recognised for involvement in examination malpractice in the 2018 WASSCE.

According to Agbale, the decision to suspend the affected principals followed the receipt of a report of investigations by the West African Examination Council that cancelled the results of affected candidates and derecognised the schools for two years with effect from 2019.

For private schools, Agbale ordered that a query be sent to 28 private secondary schools to explain, within, 72 hours, why they should not be deregistered or de-recognised for involvement in examination malpractice in the 2018 WASSCE.
