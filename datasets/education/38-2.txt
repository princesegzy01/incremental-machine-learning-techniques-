The College of Education, Zing, Taraba State, has matriculated 2,218 students for the 2018/2019 academic session.

The Provost of the College, Dr Mike Dio Jen, while administering the matriculation oath on the students during the 40th matriculation ceremony charged them to shun drug abuse and cultism.

The provost, who warned the students against indulging in vices that could destroy their future, said the authority of the college would not condone any act from students capable of rubbishing the good image of the institution.

He urged them to study hard and conduct themselves in accordance with the rules and regulations of the institution.

He said, “Today you have become full students of the College of Education, Zing, and by virtue of the oath you have taken, you are bound by the college rules and regulations which must be kept if you want to graduate.”
