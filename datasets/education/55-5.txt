Expert proffers solution to poor learning among pupils
Sunday Aborisade, Abuja

The President, National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, Dr Sally Bolujoko, has suggested the adoption of the Chinese teaching model in Nigerian schools in order to bring out the best in pupils.

She stated this on Monday while speaking at the unveiling of a book titled, Hello Phonics — A New Model in Reading written by Taiwo Adekanye, in Abuja.

Bolujoko, who was the Special Guest at the book presentation, noted that the developed world, including Britain whose model is being used in Nigeria, has since embraced the Chinese teaching model and techniques.

She said, “Our British Abacus has become obsolete, yet that is what we are giving our children. The Chinese Abacus has come; the Japanese have gone back and improved on Chinese Abacus. You can teach a child with the Chinese Abacus within three months and the child’s brain will become a computer. It is high time the Nigerian government embraced this model so that our children can work like Chinese and Japanese children.”

She appealed to the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, to encourage research that could help Nigerian pupils learn fast because the world had advanced beyond the nation’s analogue approach.

She also commended Adekanye for the well-researched book and urged the minister to adopt its use for teaching the English language in schools.

Bolujoko said, “Any child that uses this book, rather than our old ABCD studies, will begin to read within three months and speak whatever language we teach because this model can help the child to learn any language.”
