Patrick Odey, Uyo

The Rector of Federal Polytechnic, Ukana, Dr Uduak Ukekpe, has warned students of the institution to shun cultism, examination malpractices, indecent dressing and other anti-social behaviours.

Ukekpe gave the admonition during the fourth orientation seminar for students of the polytechnic on the institution campus in the Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.

He said, “This polytechnic, though relatively new, is poised to give students qualitative and functional education, especially in technological and entrepreneurial studies to put students at a vantage point.

“As students, you must shun cultism, examination malpractice, indecent dressing, fighting and other anti-social behaviours. We will not hesitate to sanction any erring student in line with laid down rules and regulations,” he said.

The rector, who promised to create a conducive environment for learning and teaching, urged the students to make good use of the opportunity offered them.

The Dean of Programmes, Mr Edet Etuk, said the orientation was aimed at acquainting new students with the rules and regulations of the school which would guide their conduct during their sojourn in the institution.

He explained that the exercise became expedient since students could only graduate after being found worthy in character and learning.
