‘Indiscipline devalues investment in education’
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

A former Special Adviser for Information and Strategy to former Osun State Governor, Mr Semiu Okanlawon, has said indiscipline in public primary and secondary schools is capable of wasting the states’ investments in education.

Speaking as the guest lecturer at the maiden Osun EduMarshals End-of-Session Evaluation and Awards ceremony in Osogbo, Okanlawon disclosed that over the decades, the decay in education was beyond physical infrastructure only, adding that there was also the decline in the quality of the teachers.

He said indiscipline, ranging from poor attitude towards learning to outright display of violence in schools among students and against teachers became rife.

Okanlawon said, “The results of these huge investments have come to manifest in the phenomenal rise in the rate of performance of Osun students in public examinations.

“While the Rauf Aregbesola administration inherited an annual average number of successful candidates with at least five credits in WASSCE of 11.6 per cent during the four-year period prior to the first term, the state under Aregbesola’s first term came up with a sustained improvement with an annual average number of successful candidates with at least five credit passes (including Mathematics and English Language) in WASSCE of 21 per cent, indicating 81 per cent improvement over a four-year period.”
