Female pupils more likely to be bullied than males – Survey
Girls are much more likely than boys to be bullied at school, with almost twice as many on the receiving end of cyberbullying and social exclusion by other pupils, according to a government study.

The figures from a survey of 10,000 pupils at schools in England in year 11 – children aged 15 or 16 – revealed a decline in reports of bullying overall and particularly in incidents of violent bullying, which mainly affects boys.

But girls reported a rise in bullying, with more than one in three telling researchers they had been affected in the previous year, while only about one in four boys said they had been victims of bullying in any form.

The report published by the Department for Education said the overall trends around bulling in schools were broadly positive, with the rate of bullying reported falling from 37 per cent of pupils in year 10 to 30 per cent for the same cohort 12 months later in year 11.

Incidents of bullying were slightly lower compared with a similar study in 2006, forms of violent bullying were lower than a decade before – with threats of violence reported by pupils down from 14 per cent to 10 per cent, and actual violence down from 10 per cent to six per cent.

“While violent forms of bullying have declined significantly, name calling and social exclusion have increased since 2006. The success in reducing violent bullying shows what can be achieved; the challenge is to replicate this success across all forms of bullying,” the report concluded.
