Many Nigerian universities yet to be ranked – Ex-VC
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

A former Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State, Prof. Musbau Akanji, has said the country still have universities that have yet to be ranked by the Nigerian universities ranking and international bodies.

Akanji, who was a guest lecturer at a workshop organised by the Kola Daisi University, Ibadan, Oyo State, for its pioneer staff on Monday, urged university to brace for the challenge of becoming one of the globally acclaimed institutions.

The professor trained the staff members of the institution alongside a Deputy Registrar, Development and Training, of the University of Ibadan, Mrs Stella Soola, as he spoke on the challenges of working in a university environment.

He, however, failed to disclose the universities that had yet to be ranked, as he urged the workers of the KDU to live up to the vision of the institution.

“You must work assiduously to nurture graduates with employability and competency skills which will help make the country to become a global force,” he said.

The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Kolade Ayorinde, said the desire of the KDU to become a world-class institution of higher learning was being pursued with vigour through research, teaching methodology, academic freedom and well equipped facilities for teaching.
