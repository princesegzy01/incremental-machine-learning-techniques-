‘Next CMD of UCTH should come from Cross River Central’
Ada Wodu, Calabar

A forum, the Southern Senatorial District Forum in Cross River State, has said the next Chief Medical Director of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital should come from the central part of the state.

The forum made the call following the submission of the names of successful interviewees for the job to the presidency for final selection.

The forum, which wants the presidency to consider Prof. Edet Ikpi, one of the successful interviewees from Cross River Central as the next CMD, made this known in a briefing in Calabar on Sunday.

Speaking for the forum, its President, Prince Peter Duke, said the Southern Senatorial District of the state had held the CMD position for 17 years while the central and northern district had held the position for eight years respectively.

He said, “It is evident that following the current political zoning practised in our state, it is the turn of a qualified candidate from the Central Senatorial zone to take this position for the purpose of equity, justice and fairness.

“Already a new Medical Director of the Psychiatric Hospital in Calabar, who is from the south has been appointed and the tenure of the CMD of UCTH would expire in a few months.”
