The Babcock University Secondary School Lagos, Ogba, Ikeja, recently held the third graduation and prize-giving ceremony for its final year pupils at the school premises.

Speaking during the event, which also doubled as the fifth anniversary of the institution, the Principal, Mr. Gabriel Fasanu, urged the graduating pupils, who were 29 in number, to be of good conduct and to always avoid anything that could tarnish their images.

Fasanu hailed the pupils for their brilliant academic performance in public examinations and for their conduct throughout their stay in the school. He said, “I am excited by your performance in the 2018 Universal Tertiary Matriculation Examination. I am also impressed to see that you showed remarkable improvement in your attitude towards spiritual and academic activities towards the end”.

The principal noted that more than half of the graduating pupils had already gained admission to various tertiary institutions in the country.

One of the graduands, Master Omotoso Oluwapelumi, was announced as the overall best pupil in SS3 for 2018. Overwhelmed with joy, the pupil attributed his success to God’s grace and the conducive learning environment provided by the management of the school.

Also, speaking at the event, the Vice-Chancellor of Adeleke University, Ede, Osun State, Prof. Samuel Alao, urged the pupils to find their identities, meaning and purpose in life through connection to the community, the natural world and to the spiritual values, such as faith, compassion, peace and trust in God as they set to continue their education.
