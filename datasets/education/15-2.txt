The Rector, Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, Dr Olusegun Aluko, has described the discrimination against polytechnic graduates in the country as unfortunate.

Aluko maintained that polytechnic graduates had the entrepreneurial skills that could make them self-sufficient.

The rector stated this during a press briefing held in Ilaro, ahead of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the polytechnic.

Aluko, who said the polytechinc was established by decree 33 on July 25, 1979, claimed that it could boast of various achievements.

He added that many graduates of the polytechnics were self-employed and have dominated every profession due to the exceptional skills they had acquired.

According to him, polytechnic education is a way of training students on how they can be self-sufficient and stand on their own.

“You will discover that many of the people that dominate every profession are polytechnic graduates.

“The discrimination against polytechnic graduates is unfortunate,” he said.

Speaking on cultism, which was rampant in the institution some years ago, Aluko said strict enforcement of the polytechnic’s rules and guidelines were responsible for eradication of cultism and other social vices on the campus.

He added that, enforcement of a dress code and regular counselling on attitudinal change also contributed to the peaceful conduct of the students on campus.

He said, “The reason we have not been in the news on any cult related activity was as a result of our strict compliance of the polytechnic’s rules on the students.”
