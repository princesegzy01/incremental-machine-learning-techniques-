Ted Odogwu, Kano

The National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion has inaugurated Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Office in Bayero University.

According to the office, the move was to promote and protect intellectual property right, as well as raise awareness about the intellectual property among researchers.

The Director-General of NOTAP, Dr Danâ€™Azumi Ibrahim, who was represented by the Director, Consultancy Services, Dr Adamu Tandama, said NOTAP serves as a functional bridge in sustaining the link between the research community and industry, thus making it a strong anchor for stimulating national development.

The DG said henceforth, Bayero University should begin to turn out patents from its research results. He added that most of the universities had turned their intellectual property into publication, saying that they should combine them with a patent.

The Chief Executive explained that adoption of this would not only show the economic tools of the university, but would equally unveil its technological advancement.
