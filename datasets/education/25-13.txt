The Vice-Chancellor of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, Prof. Igbekele Ajibefun, has charged the newly-admitted students of the institution to shun vices capable of thwarting their academic pursuits,

Ajibefun, who congratulated the students on their admission, also informed the new students that the university was committed to preparing them to fulfill their academic dreams.

The VC said this during the university’s matriculation ceremony for the 2018/2019 academic session.

No fewer than 5,305 students took the matriculation oath of the university at the event.

The VC said, “It’s important to note that you are very fortunate to be among the 5,305 candidates admitted to this university. It is on this note that I would like to admonish you to take your admission seriously by being studious and ensure that your individual studentship is sustained.

“Let me remind you, as I also did during your orientation programme, that this university has zero tolerance for vices, including examination misconduct, rape, cultism, fraud and theft.

“I am happy to inform you, dear new students and distinguished parents and guardians, that Adekunle Ajasin University has the required conducive learning environment and facilities; as well as the human and material resources that will enable our students to fulfil their learning aspirations.”

The Acting Registrar, Mr Opeoluwa Akinfemiwa, administered the matriculation oath on the new students.
