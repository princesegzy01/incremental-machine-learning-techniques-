Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Old boys of Saint Charles Grammar School, Osogbo, who graduated in 1978 and 1979, have renovated a storey building of 12 classrooms in the school.

The old boys, at a reunion held recently to mark the 40th anniversary of their graduation tagged Charleans 789 Stanza, also honoured some old teachers, present teachers and gave post-humous awards to 25 members of both sets.

In his welcome address, the Chairman of the event, Olufemi Olaseinde said the event was to enable the sets to contribute towards restoring the school to its former glory.

He said, “The spirit of togetherness we shared in our classrooms and hostels as young people must be kept alive. Charleans 789 should be a reunion of souls, recounting the good old days of brotherly unconditional love and celebration of the wrinkles, baldness and grey hairs that mark our mileage.”

The National President of SCOBA, Rotimi Aluko, commended members of the sets for embarking on the project which he described as ‘ambitious and huge’, as he assured that the national leadership of the association would continue to steer efforts towards strengthening the association.
