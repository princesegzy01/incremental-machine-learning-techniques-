In celebration of Children’s Day and in demonstration of its Corporate Social Responsibility, Axxela Limited, a gas and power portfolio company, last Friday opened the refurbished blocks of classrooms at the Olowogbowo Methodist Primary School on Lagos Island, donated books to its library and provided school supplies for the pupils.

The refurbishment included the repair of sixteen classrooms, replacement of damaged windows, installation of new library bookshelves, restoration of the playground, provision of a fully-equipped sickbay, as well as the replacement of all toilets and sewage system.

Speaking on the initiative, Axxela’s Community Relations Manager, Aloiye Aigbonoga said, “We refurbished the school to further our commitment to improving the learning habits and reading culture among our youth.

“We are also proud to empower staff of the school by providing an improved work environment, as this initiative gets us closer to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 4 of Quality Education.”

Commenting on the project, the Secretary, Lagos Island Government Education Authority, Moshood Mayegun, said, “We are indeed grateful to Axxela for this intervention that will go a long way in boosting the morale of the pupils while giving them access to quality education with the much-needed resources and facilities. The children of the school can now learn in a more conducive environment, and we promise to make judicious use of the facilities provided.”

The company also said it had inaugurated the re-constructed the Elegbata Sports Complex, also located on Lagos Island.
