The Head of Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre for the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Felicia Ikechukwu, has advised parents and teachers to urgently seek help for pupils found to be abusing drugs, in order to curb addiction.

Ikechukwu, who stated this on Saturday at the 14th Valedictory Service of Wellspring College in Omole, Lagos, condemned the use of any form of drugs in an abusive manner.

She said, “Pupils now mix hard drugs and cough syrups containing codeine in soft drinks for their consumption. Parents and teachers must take note of the kind of friends their wards mingle with. The best way to help an addict is to seek help for them and not to cover it up. We have children centres across the state. You can also visit any of our offices for help.”

Ikechukwu also warned against what she described as “incessant partying of pupils” which was identified as one of the reasons pupils get addicted to drugs.

The principal of the college, Mrs Oluwayemisi Oloriade, advised the graduating pupils to be good ambassadors of the college.

She said, “Do not engage in any dishonest practice even though the prevailing disposition of today’s society appears to negate the axiom, ‘honesty is the best policy’. Do not negate the success story of this great college. Avoid cultism, beware of greed, do away with idleness and continuously educate yourself by building on all the experiences you have gathered over the years.”
