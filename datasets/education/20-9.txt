The don, whose lecture was titled ‘Education and Technology in the 21st Century – The Roles of Governments and Alumni Associations as Enablers’, said the government should not be left alone to shoulder the burden of providing qualitative education.

Harping on the importance of technology in enhancing teaching and learning, he said, “Computers and other electronic devices, as well as software, have made learning and teaching more adaptive, engaging and interesting, even as technology can also produce a multiplier effect for the teacher.”

He urged education policy makers and designers of curriculum to be conscious of the emerging trends and the peculiar needs of society.

He also called on the association to remain steadfast and be a critical stakeholder in policy advocacy, as well as see to the overall well-being of the alma mater.
