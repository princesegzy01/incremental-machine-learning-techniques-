Expert laments poor infrastructure in tertiary institutions
Peter Dada, Akure

An architect, Wale Adelowo, has called on the governments at all levels to fund tertiary institutions in the country, especially in the area of infrastructure.

He said the non-provision of conducive environments for learning would have a negative effect on the products of such tertiary institutions.

Adelowo stated this as he delivered the second annual lecture of Federal Polytechnic, Ile Oluj, Ondo State, titled, School facilities: An essential combination of education infrastructure and organised by the Directorate of Physical Planning of the polytechnic.

According to him, “The presence or otherwise and the quality of the basic facilities that an educational institution requires to function will determine the productivity of the institution. If education is important to national development and school facility is said to be the driver of education, then the place of school facility in education and infrastructural policies of Nigeria requires critical examination.

“The resultant effect of poor policy implementation and poor funding on tertiary education is lack of or grossly inadequate facilities. In some institutions students can be seen hanging out of windows and doors receiving lectures. The poor state of our school environment is bound to breed high level of mediocrity.”

In his remarks, the Rector of the polytechnic, Prof. Emmanuel Fasakin said, the title of the lecture was germane, apt and timely, particularly when taking into consideration the recurring case of buildings collapse in the country.
