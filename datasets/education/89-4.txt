The Lagos State Government has conducted its 2018 Screening Test for over 11,000 candidates seeking admission into the 16 Lagos State Junior Model Colleges and Upgraded Junior Secondary Schools.

The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Mrs. Adebunmi Adekanye, while monitoring the examination in some Paper Based Test centres being conducted at 43 designated locations across the state, noted that the introduction of the Digital Innovation Question Paper in the examination had eliminated examination malpractice.

She described the DIQP as a style of examination that involves the randomisation of questions and answers into 30,000 types without similarities.

Explaining that for a candidate to be admitted into the state’s model colleges, the candidate must score at least 65 per cent, Adekanye said, “I am satisfied with the conduct of the examination and I am assured that the state government will not relent in its efforts to take the education sector to the promise land.”

Imploring parents and schools to help children become ICT compliant, she added, “Every year, the ministry of education records an improvement in the registration of CBT version that started in 2015 with 17 candidates. The world is going digital and Lagos State is moving from mega city to smart city. Therefore, the CBT is the best option because it is faster and easier.”
