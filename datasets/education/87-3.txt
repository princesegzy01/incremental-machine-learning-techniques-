Pupils of Rosecroft Preparatory School, Ijaiye, and Cedar Groove School, Ebute-Meta, Lagos, have visited the Muritala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos as part of activities marking the six years of the Dana Air crash.

The pupils who were taken round the local and international wings of the airport also got educational materials from the authorities of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria, presented by Mrs. Julian Bright–Idiaghe.

The convener, Victims of Dana Air Crash Memorial, Mrs. Oladuni Afolabi, while speaking with our correspondent, said her team was tasked with putting together a memorial event in honour of the Dana Air crash victims. “Our major objective is to remember the lessons that came with the crash and how to channel conversations on how we can prevent avoidable air crashes.”

Oladuni said the excursion was for the children who saw the aircraft or heard the story of the crash and making them see that airtravel is a safe means of transportation.

“This excursion was important because we needed to tell them that even though they schooled or lived near where the air crash occurred, airplanes and air transportation are not death traps. Aviation is not as bad as they think it is and we are channeling so many conversations around the experiences of the air crash basically to correct the bias any child might have on aviation,” she said.

She noted that even though it was a story the children would always hear in the news, through the visit to the airport they could remember the victims, remember the children who were victims of the crash.
