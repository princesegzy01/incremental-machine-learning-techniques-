UNILAG ’86 accounting set institutes academic prize
The 1986 set of the Department of Accounting at the University of Lagos has said that it would institute an academic prize to promote scholarship among students of the department.

The pioneer Chairman of the association, Alhaji Tajudeen Amodu, disclosed this at a reunion held in Lekki, Lagos.

Amodu explained that the prize would be awarded to the best student in International Accounting in honour of a former Head of Department, Dr Catherine Ajayi.

“She (Ajayi) was the HOD when we were there. So, we just want to honour her. She is still alive, although retired,” he said.

Amodu also promised that the association would not only strive to increase its membership but also support students of the department by “taking stock of their needs” and organising annual lectures.
