Olufemi Atoyebi, Ibadan

The Executive Secretary of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, Dr Abdullahi Baffa, has unveiled six projects valued at the sum of N5.6bn at the University of Ibadan, being part of a total of 42 projects approved for the institution.

The projects include a 1,000 capacity lecture theatre for the Faculty of Science, a building for the Department of Food Technology, lecture rooms and offices for the Institute of African Studies, auditorium, lecture rooms and offices for the Faculty of Pharmacy and Information Communication Technology centre and laboratory for the Department of Virology, University Teaching Hospital, Ibadan. Baffa said the projects were for the 2008-2010 Merger Fund.

He said, “The TETFUND projects, worth a total of N6.5bn, are for the 2008-2010 allocations meant for infrastructural support by the Federal Government. The six projects are just part of the total of the 42 TETFUND projects approved for UI. The institution has yet to access the approvals for 2015, 2016 and 2017 fund because it has not also met the requirements to access the backlog of years. The requirements are performance, utilisation of fund, retirement, submission of audited account, inspection and commissioning of projects.”

In his comment, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof Abel Olayinka, who was represented by the Deputy Vice Chancellor Administration, Prof Kayode Adebowale, commended TETFUND boss for his support towards the institution.
