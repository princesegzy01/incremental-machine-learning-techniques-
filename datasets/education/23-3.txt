Poverty shouldn’t stop children’s education — Omisore

A Lagos-based educationist and author, Mr Michael Omisore, has said poverty should not be an excuse for not sending children to school.

Rather, he said poverty should be a motivation to invest in the education of Nigerian children.

Omisore urged the government to demonstrate more commitment to the funding of education.

He said this in a statement while presenting a paper titled, ‘Rethinking Education’, at the International Pan-African Conference on Challenges of Growth and Sustainable Development in Africa held recently at Chrisland University, Abeokuta, Ogun State.

The conference, which was chaired by a former Vice President of Liberia, Sir Joseph Boakai, had a former Minister of Education, Mrs Obiageli Ezekwesili and the Executive Secretary, Centre for Research and Documentation on Oral Traditions and Development of African Languages, Prof. Charles Bikoi, as keynote speakers.

Omisore, in the paper, submitted that “certain parts of the country are not well disposed to education and there was nothing that anybody can do to change their orientation. Whether we admit it or not, the right values for education are not entrenched in certain parts of the country and other parts that had such values before, are losing them fast.”
