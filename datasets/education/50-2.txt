‘Tai Solarin taught us to excel, stand alone’
Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

The Chairperson of the 1989-1994 set of pupils of Mayflower School, Ikenne in Ogun State, Olasunbo Muniru, has said that the founder of the school, late Tai Solarin taught them to excel and stand alone anywhere they found themselves.

Muniru said this while handing over an ultra modern clinic to the school authorities recently in Ikenne.

She said the clinic was donated as part of the activities for the celebration of the set’s 25th anniversary.

Speaking on behalf of her colleagues, Muniru said the clinic was built through the concerted efforts of the old pupils.

“As pupils of Mayflower School, we pride ourselves in self-reliance. Uncle Tai Solarin taught us that anywhere we are, we should stand alone and ensure that we excel. What is worth doing at all is worth doing well and it must be done with undivided attention.

“We conceived the idea for this project and decided that we can achieve it, even in the absence of a strong financial background. I was scared initially, but my project chairman encouraged us to give it a try. Here we are today at the commissioning ceremony of a complete ultra-modern clinic. I feel on top of the world.”
