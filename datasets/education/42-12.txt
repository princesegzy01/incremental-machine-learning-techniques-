At the 48th Annual Inter House Sports competition of the Federal Science and Technical College in Yaba, Lagos, last Saturday, the Principal of the college, Dr Ogochukwu Ufoegbune, said the time had come for the Federal Government to diversify the country’s economy from oil to sport.

Ufoegbune also said sport had been used to improve the economy and promote socio-economic development in various countries, as she urged the government to give attention to other areas, especially sport, in an effort to accelerate national growth and development.

Linking education and sports, the principal said, “Education and sport complement each other and many pupils who excel academically also hold sway in sports. The place of sports in education today cannot be overemphasised. We have seen many pupils today who go into various sports and are living well. We want to urge parents not to discourage their children from participating in sports because they may not know where the talents of the children lie.”

Ufoegbune, however, lauded the government for its commitment to repositioning government colleges nationwide, as she appealed for more facilities to be made available for workshops in the college.

“We have 19 trade subjects, and most of the facilities in the workshops need 21st century facilities to enhance skill acquisition,” she said.
