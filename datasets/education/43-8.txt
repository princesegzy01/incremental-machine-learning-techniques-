13,390 Ekiti pupils set for free SSCE
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

About 13,390 pupils in Ekiti State are set to sit for the West African Examinations Council’s April/May 2019 Senior School Certificate Examination, following the state government’s approved payment of over N24m to school principals for the candidates.

This was made known by the state’s Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mr Ayodeji Ajayi, who said the government had paid N1,850 per pupil to take care of administrative charges and incidental expenses during the examination.

Ajayi, who spoke to our correspondent on Tuesday in Ado Ekiti, said, “The government had earlier paid the SSCE fees for all pupils in public schools in furtherance of its free and compulsory education policy. The payment is to ensure the pupils did not pay anything for the examination.

“Also, the government has zero tolerance for examination malpractice, as such any school involved in examination malpractices would be punished in accordance with the law.”

He also said that vice principals who had served for over 20 years would henceforth be engaged in supervision of certificate examinations in the state.
