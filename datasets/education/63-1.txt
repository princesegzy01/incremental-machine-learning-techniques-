The Federal Government has said that 9,300, 892 pupils across 26 states have been captured in the school feeding programme.

The FG made this known via the Special Adviser to President MuhammaduBuhari on Social Investment Programmes in the Office of the Vice-President, Mrs Maryam Uwais, on Thursday in Abuja.

Giving the update on the programme at a briefing, the FG disclosed that the pupils were drawn from 49,837 government schools in the states.

Uwais said the school feeding programme had also engaged about 96,972 cooks with over 100,000 small scale farmers being part of the supply chain for food items.

She said, “Being a programme that aims at empowering communities, the government has engaged 96,972 cooks with over 100,000 small scale farmers being part of the value chain, supplying locally sourced ingredients. So far, the government is now feeding 9,300,892 children in 49,837 government schools in 26 states.

“It is noteworthy that currently, public schools require 6,800,000 eggs, 594 cattle and 83 metric tons of fish weekly to be supplied to the cooks, for the purpose of feeding the children. On the N-power programme which has currently employed 500,000 graduates, the government has also supported 20,000 N-power non-graduate volunteers, who have been trained at skill centres in every state.They have been given tool boxes to enable them apply their newly acquired expertise in the building and automotive industries.”

The SA also gave an update on the Conditional Cash Transfer Programme under the Social Investment Programme, saying the government gave N5,000 monthly to 297,973 households in the country; a programme which she said was currently being implemented in 20 states.

“As a critical component of the cash transfer programme, we have trained almost 3,000 Community cash transfer facilitators in every ward where the programme is ongoing, to build the capacities of our beneficiaries and support them to become productive and take ownership of their lives,” she added.
