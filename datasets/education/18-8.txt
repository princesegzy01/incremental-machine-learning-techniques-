No fewer than 387 members of staff of the Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Anambra State, have been promoted.

The Public Relations Officer of the institution, Obini Onuchukwu, said stated this on Monday in a press briefing in Awka, the Anambra State capital.

He said the promotion was as a result of the approval of the backlog of promotions up to 2018 by the Expanded Management Committee of the school.

Onuchukwu added that about 82 lecturers were promoted to their next ranks while 310 non-teaching staff members benefited from the exercise, out of which 26 principal assistant registrars were moved to the rank of deputy registrars.

He said the Federal Ministry of Education had ratified the promotions according to extant rules.

He said an internal committee had been set up to address issues of proper placement, conversion, upgrading and other outstanding welfare matters about the staff in a bid to motivate them.

“The committee have started receiving submissions from affected staff and will soon forward their recommendations to the management for considerations.

“The management of the institution has intensified efforts in attracting more approvals for short courses and research programmes for staff of the polytechnic through the Tertiary Education Trust Fund in order to improve their individual competencies.”

Onuchukwu further said the polytechnic was putting finishing touches to the preparations for the forthcoming accreditation slated for August, 2019.

He said all academic departments of the polytechnic had received a facelift preparatory to the exercise.
