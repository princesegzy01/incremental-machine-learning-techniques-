Parents protest over high common entrance fees in Delta
Ochei Matthew, Asaba

Parents in Delta State have protested the high cost of the Common Entrance Examination, as fixed by the Delta State Government for primary school pupils seeking admission to secondary schools.

The parents, as our correspondent gathered, on Thursday, asked the government to explain why pupils in various public schools were subjected to pay the sums of N7,000, N10,000 and N12,000 as registration fees for the examination, while external pupils were made to register for N17,000.

One of the parents, Mrs Okwokwo, who spoke with our correspondent said, “I paid N10,000 to register my child for the common entrance examination. After paying N10,000, I also paid N500 for lesson fees and N100 for consumable. I don’t know what they mean by consumable. I also paid N150 for test and they are now asking us to pay N400 for report card.

“Government says it is free education for public schools, but what we are seeing now is a different thing.”

Findings also revealed that some of the private schools who were yet to be approved common entrance exam centres were collecting N7,000 from their pupils and merged them public school pupils, an agreement reached between the heads of both schools.

Several calls and text massages to the Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education in Delta State, Mr Chedu Ebie, were made but he refused to pick his calls nor reply the text messages.
