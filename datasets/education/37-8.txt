The government of Turkey has given Nigerian students who wish to study in the Eastern Europe country access to over 80 government universities with 90 per cent scholarship.

This was made known by Goodmus Learning Centre, a Nigerian institution licensed to enrol students for the scholarship.

The Chief Executive Officer of centre, Badmus Adekunle, said the scholarship was aimed at reducing the cost of studying abroad.

“It takes an entrance examination for students to enjoy the tuition that only Turkish nationals enjoy. It is made possible due to the educational bilateral agreement between the Nigerian and Turkish governments to allow our students to enjoy Turkish government’s subsidy on education.

“The examination also enables students to get admission to Uludag University and over 80 others. An examination will hold on May 25 and Senior Secondary two pupils to PhD students are eligible to sit for it. The programme also enables candidates to get into the Erasmus Exchange Programme with other universities in Europe, America and Asia.”

Explaining the essence of the scholarship, a professor of Veterinary Medicine at Uludag University, Turkey, Ilker Arican, said it was an opportunity for students in Africa to study in a reputable foreign university.

“In Uludag University, we have about 5,000 foreign students. When they come, they also learn Turkish language and any Nigerian student who is able to learn Turkish language to an extent would be able to do a bachelor’s degree programme in eight months. After one year, they can work in Turkey as well.”
