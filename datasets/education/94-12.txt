Fed varsity Katsina laments poor funding
Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

The Federal University, Dutsin-Ma, Katsina State, has urged the Federal Government to improve funds provided to universities so as to be able to fast-track educational developments.

The Pro-Chancellor of the university, Dr Marliyya Zayyan, stated this in Abuja in a release issued at the end of a retreat held by the Governing Council of the institution, noting that the university had to look into the areas of investments for Internally Generated Revenue, due to the paucity of funds.

Zayyan said the government must also institute a control mechanism on unutilised funds at the end of a financial year instead of removing such funds from the university.

She said, “The purpose of the retreat is to consolidate on the rules and regulations governing the university system, the functions and responsibilities of the major organs and the importance of internally generated revenue to the survival of universities in the Nigerian education milieu.

“Finances to universities should be increased to fast-track educational development. Government should institute a control mechanism on unutilised funds at the end of a financial year instead of removing the funds from the universities.

“The government should put machinery in motion to develop human resources in the various procurement units of the universities. It should also institute more solid monitoring mechanisms on procurement processes.”
