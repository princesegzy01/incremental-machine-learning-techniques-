He also said the competition would commence with an online test slated for March and then proceed to a physical computer-based test on May 25, during which the finalist would be selected.

He said, “The third phase will take place in June for the shortlisted pupils and the grand finale will be held in July. Also, to improve the capacity of chemistry teachers, there would be a two-day training programme. The top three winners will receive a trophy, a medal and N1m, N750,000 and N500,000, respectively.”

The chairman Advisory board of the competition, Prof. Oladele Osibanjo, commended the company for promoting and rekindling the study of chemistry in secondary schools and higher institutions.
