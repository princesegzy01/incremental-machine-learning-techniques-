Alexander Okere, Benin

The management of the Edo State Polytechnic, Usen, on Monday said it would partner the Benin Electricity Distribution Company to deepen the input of its electrical, electronics and mechanical engineering programmes.

It said that the partnership, which would begin with a career fair in July, was aimed at strengthening the academic programmes in the operations of the distribution company.

The Rector of the institution, Prof. Biodun Falodun, in a statement, said the institution would also create economic opportunities for students in the Departments of Electrical/Electronics and Mechanical Engineering.

Falodun said the institution was expanding its frontiers to explore sustainable partnerships with national and multinational companies to train students to not only be employable after graduation but also to be self-sustaining.

The rector said that the partnership with the BEDC was the first in the institution’s drive to improve collaborations expected to boost the school’s capacity to respond to the needs of the society.

He said, “Edo State Polytechnic has concluded plans to partner and collaborate with national and multinational corporations, beginning with the Benin Electricity Distribution Company. This new synergy will afford BEDC the ample opportunity to recruit, train and employ graduates of the school into its workforce.”
