Ife Ogunfuwa

The Lagos Chamber of Commerce of Industry says the Nigeria could derive huge economic benefits by driving the fourth industrial revolution in the country.

The President, Lagos Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Babatunde Ruwase, said this would be the focus of discussion at the 2019 ICTEL EXPO.

According to him, the ICTEL EXPO will provide a great opportunity to influence national discourse on the culture of enterprise in Nigeria from an ICT positive perspective.

Ruwase said that the expo with the theme, ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution: Implications for the Nigerian Economy’ is scheduled to hold in mid-July in Lagos.

Speaking on this, he said Nigeria could achieve the realities and implications of the fourth industrial revolution, if the government would articulate the results of the conference into a policy document.

Ruwase therefore urged the governments at all levels to rise up to the challenges of increasing technological revolution in order to be ranked among great nations.

“The fourth industrial revolution is a topical issue Nigerians and Africans as a whole are not taking seriously, which may have far-reaching implications in the country and Africa in general”, he noted.

The Chairman, Specialised Exhibition Committee, Trade Promotion Board, LCCI, Lere Kupoluyi, said that the commitment of LCCI in promoting the technology advancement of the country could not be overestimated.

“The LCCI, as part of its mandate to foster an enabling environment for businesses, has identified technology-driven updates and innovations as critical success factors for entrepreneurship development and sustainable businesses.”
