‘We’ll help you to fulfil your dreams’
Ada Wodu, Calabar

The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calabar in Cross River State, Prof. Zana Akpagu, has assured the school’s 10,450 new students that the institution will help them to fulfil their academic and social dreams.

Akpagu stated this during the 41st matriculation of the institution where he said the dreams of the students could be achieved if they stayed committed to their studies and positive personal character.

He urged the new students to make themselves, their parents and guardians proud by being responsible and by working hard to top their classes.

Akpagu said, “As students, you will now be bound by the rules and regulations of the university and become beneficiaries of all rights and privileges due to bona fide students. You must keep before you always, the very reason that you are here; know always that your admission offers you a lifetime opportunity which you must not waste.

“The university is prepared to help you to fulfil your academic and social dreams because our members of staff do not just teach, they also help you develop additional competencies that will make you complete graduates and carry out world-leading research in your subject areas.’’

Akpagu said with the assistance of the Federal Government, especially through the Tertiary Education Trust Fund and Needs Assessment Funds, the university was building new faculties, lecture halls and hostels to ameliorate shortfall.

He advised the new students to shun secret cults because the university had zero-tolerance for cultism, hooliganism, corruption and other vices, as there would be penalties for those who contravened the school’s laws.
