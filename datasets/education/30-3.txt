11th TOSSE’ll give schools free legal aid, says Convener
The Convener of the Total School Support Seminar and Exhibition, Mrs Yinka Ogunde, has disclosed that at 11th edition of the education show billed for June 6 and 7, schools would be given free legal support and advise.

In an interview with our correspondent on Wednesday, Ogunde said the show, would have new features like the business clinic and a leadership seminar.

She said, “It is a platform that brings school owners, head teachers and administrators together. They are coming to learn, network and see new things and also attend various seminars. We also have the legal aid unit which is to provide free legal consultancy services to schools who may wish to ask questions on various legal issues.”

Stating that the exhibition was born out of the need to bridge the gap between companies developing innovative services and educational establishments, Ogunde revealed that the plan was to improve the skills of education professionals across Africa.

“We intend to continue to make the program relevant to the education sector. It is a dynamic event and we hope that every education professional will improve on his or her skills. We intend to continue to introduce companies designing innovative products.

“We are also optimistic that we would be able to take the TOSSE program across the continent. We are already attracting quite a number of visitors from the sub region and outside the region. We hope, in the years to come, to have people from North America and other parts of Africa coming for the TOSSE programme.”
