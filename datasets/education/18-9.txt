IPPIS: ASUP YABATECH rejects forceful enrolment of members
The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, Yaba College of Technology, Lagos, on Monday rejected the forceful enrolment of its members on the Federal Government Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that ASUP Chairman in the college, Mr Nureni Yekini, made the decision of the union known at a news conference in the college, following the directive of the national body.

Yekini said the national body of the union had on July 25 held an emergency meeting in Abuja over the invasion and forceful enrolment of its members in the college.

He said the template used by the IPPIS presently does not recognise all the special allowances for academic staff in the polytechnic sector.

“The Federal Government is bringing all sorts of innovations here and there, but we are academics.

“We are not against innovation being brought by President Muhammadu Buhari, but as regards IPPIS, there are peculiarities that need to be addressed.

“If they enrol us, there is going to be a lot of problems and difficulties for our members,” he said.

Yekini said some issues must be addressed before the union could be enrolled on the platform, including peculiar allowance, 65 years retirement age and sabbatical leave allowance.

Yekini also complained that the IPPIS did not have any mechanism for addressing or redressing issues relating to delay of salary and omission of salary, adding that this was not a good one.

“If we have problems with our salary now, it means we have to go to Abuja on our own expenses,” he said.
