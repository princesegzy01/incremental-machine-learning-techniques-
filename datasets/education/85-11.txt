Hope Waddell Training Institution gets books worth N1.2m
Mudiaga Affe, Calabar

Hope Waddell Training Institution, Calabar, Cross River State, one of the colleges founded by early missionaries, has got books worth N1.2m from a former pupil of the school, Mr. Mani Robson.

Robson, who is the President of Temple and Aegean-Das Limited, Lagos, presented the books to the Principal, Mr. Samuel Ikpeme, as he said the donation was to help pupils of the institute in their academic pursuit.

“I have discovered that government alone cannot provide all that is required for the education system in this country. I believe that individuals, especially old students, can do a lot to support our schools. What we are doing here today is also part of our social responsibility. I want to say that I am very happy for this donation because this gesture is just part of a future long-standing relationship between my company and this school,” Robson said.

He assured the management of the school that the company would donate more books and carry out renovations of dilapidated structures, as he announced a scholarship of N100, 000 to the best graduating SSS3 pupil.

Responding, the principal of the school described the gesture as a dream come true, noting that he was the first old pupil to make such a donation to the school.

“This is very spectacular. This kind of gesture has never happened in this school. There is nobody that has singlehandedly done what we are seeing today,” Ikpeme said.

The textbooks cover English Language, Literature, Mathematics, Economics, History and Geography.
