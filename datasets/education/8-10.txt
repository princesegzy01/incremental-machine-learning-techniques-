We’ll get to root of FUOYE riot —Fayemi
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has vowed to get to the root of the recent crisis at the Federal University, Oye Ekiti with a view to preventing a re-occurrence.

A protest embarked upon by the students of the institution over the poor state of electricity at the Oye Ekiti and Ikole Ekiti campuses of the institution, had turned violent and two students lost their lives in the incident, while others sustained injuries.

A statement from the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Yinka Oyebode, on Monday stated that the governor, represented by his Chief of Staff, Biodun Omoleye, spoke in Ado Ekiti on Friday during a meeting with the management of FUOYE over the crisis.

The governor, who condoled with the school management and the families of the two students who were killed, stated that the crisis might have resulted from a communication gap between the students and the school management.

He said, “The unfortunate incident was avoidable, if the students had channeled their agitation to the school authorities, which could have taken up the matter and appropriately resolved it”.

FUOYE’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Abayomi Fashina, said the ugly incident could have been avoided if the students had not regrouped after the initial demonstration in the morning.

“They shouldn’t have regrouped in the afternoon. It happened outside the university. I was still in the office working at the time. The Students’ Union leaders told the Commissioner of Police that they wanted to do a guided protest,” he said.
