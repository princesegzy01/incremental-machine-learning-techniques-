MSSN warns governorship candidates on hijab
The Lagos State Area unit of the Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria has maintained that an unconditional approval for female students to wear hijab in schools would be one of the criteria for voting for any governorship candidate in the state.

The Amir of the unit, Dr. Saheed Ashafa, said this at a world press conference on the state of the nation and the organisation’s ongoing 106th Islamic Vacation Course in Noforija, Epe.

Noting that assault on school children over the use of hijab was a violation of their fundamental rights and freedom, he said that government and school authorities should embrace the use of hijab in schools.

He warned principals who still punish female students for using hijab despite the circular from the government to desist from doing so.

He said that their action was capable of maligning the peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths in Lagos State.

He, however, stated that the MSSN had made tremendous progress on the matter so far and would not relent.

Speaking on the 2019 election, Ashafa explained that delegates at the ongoing camp had been sensitised to maintain and promote peace.

He emphasised that educational development and willingness to allow the use of hijab by female students in schools would form a major basis for supporting any candidate.

He said, “Let me make something clear. MSSNLagos is not a political organisation but millions of our members are qualified voters. We have sensitised them enough to get their Permanent Voter Cards and the need to be peaceful during the election.

“We have been very careful in taking a position on the governorship election in Lagos State, but something is clear: we will not support any candidate that will pose a challenge to the use of hijab by our members in schools or deny us any of our rights.”
