The camp, which ended on Saturday, saw the foundation train the pupils, for free, in coding and robotics, vocational skills, entrepreneurship, leadership skills, etiquette, public speaking, team orientation and organisation skills.

Upon conclusion of the summer camp, exceptional participants were granted scholarship and mentorship opportunities which would last three months.

The participants were also granted the opportunity to sell the products they created during the camp.
