About 56,000 pupils across the country have taken the stage one qualifying examination for the 2019 Cowbellpedia Secondary School Mathematics Television Quiz Show.

According to Promasidor Nigeria Limited, the sponsors of the show, the figure represents 27.2 per cent increase over the 44,000 pupils recorded in 2018.

In a statement made available to our correspondent, Promasidor said that out of the 56,000 pupils, the best 108 would proceed to the TV quiz show to compete for the ultimate prize of N2m and an all-expense paid educational excursion outside the country.

Assessing the conduct of candidates, a National Examinations Council official, Charles Aneke, said that although it was quite an arduous task getting the candidates to follow instructions, the exercise was successful.

This was just as an official of the Lagos State Ministry of Education, Benedict Adegoke, expressed satisfaction with the general conduct of the candidates and the examination.
