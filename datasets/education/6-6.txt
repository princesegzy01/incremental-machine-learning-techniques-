Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The 1988/1993 set of Ilesa Grammar School, Ilesa, Osun State, has presented 11 indigent students of the school that with scholarship.

President of the set, Wahab Adeniran, while unveiling the beneficiaries, urged Osun State Government to reverse single uniform policy for public schools introduced to the state by the immediate past administration.

He said uniform remains a symbol that students will not want to lose easily, adding that even as old students of Ilesha Grammar School, they still cherished old uniform of the school, hence why they wanted the policy of common uniform reversed.

On how the beneficiaries emerged, Adeniran, said they were selected based on their moral, extra talents and academic performances.

He said, “We also see it as part of ways of giving back to our school. We have been doing at different capacity before now.

“The aim of the scholarship award is to recognise the extra talents of students, apart from academic performances to motivate them to shine in their respective fields.

“The awardees were selected with due diligence, in fair and transparent manner. Their fees in school, WAEC and NECO examinations will be taken care of.”
