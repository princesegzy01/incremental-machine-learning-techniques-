Be wary of scammers, EKSU VC tells new students
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Vice-Chancellor of Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, Prof. Olubunmi Ajayi, has urged the 7,664 newly admitted students of the institution to be wary of scammers.

Ajayi told the students that scammers could hide under the guise of rendering assistance to unsuspecting students, while robbing them of their money and other possessions.

She said this on Friday during the matriculation of first degree students for the 2018/2019 academic session. “The university will continue to enforce 70 per cent attendance for any student to be eligible to sit for examinations, hence the need to attend lectures regularly.”

Ajayi, however, warned, “The university will no longer accommodate those who default in the payment of fees. Failure to pay on time can lead to loss of studentship. The university has put in place a task force to enforce strict compliance.”

She also advised the students not to join unregistered societies and abide by the rules and regulations of the institution in order to avoid being suspended or expelled.
