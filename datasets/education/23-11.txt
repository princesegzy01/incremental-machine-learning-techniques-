The Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research, Innovation and Strategic Partnerships at the University of Ibadan, Prof. Olanike Adeyemo, has called on the Federal Government to commit more funds to research and innovation to solve problems confronting the nation.

Nigeria, according to Adeyemo, has been complacent in solving her problems, saying that the country should have invested more money in research and development.

The DVC made the call at the 78th Interdisciplinary Discourse of the postgraduate college delivered by Prof. Adesoji Adesina.

While noting that foreign funders dictate researches they want to fund to Nigerian researchers, Adeyemo advised the Federal Government and private companies to fund researches that align with solving national problems.

She also tasked researchers to continue to attract funding through their work.

“We are too complacent because we do not have natural disasters. International organisations fund researches that are relevant to them. I am sorry to say this but we have civil servant professors who just receive monthly salaries without having any grants to their name. We must step up our game and contribute to solving problems facing our country,” Adeyemo said.

The guest lecturer, Adesina, said the country’s business sector must fund research and development, as he called on the government to formulate policies that will make funding a reality.

He also urged universities to adopt entrepreneurial models to develop new products and access new markets using new technology.
