Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Chairman, Ekiti State Universal Basic Education Board, Prof Francisca Aladejana, has directed teachers in public primary schools in the state to start the new academic year with resumption tests.

Aladejana also instructed the teachers to resume academic activities immediately.

The SUBEB boss gave the directive on Wednesday, while monitoring the resumption of schools in the state for the 2019/2020 Academic Session.

She warned teachers and school principals against collecting illegal fees from the pupils, adding that anybody caught sending pupils away from school on account of non-payment of any levy would face the wrath of the state government.

She said, “The state government is committed to the provision of a conducive teaching and learning environment in schools. All schools in the state will wear a new look soon”.

Aladejana charged teachers in all the schools she visited to live up to the expectations of the government and to reciprocate the latter’s kind gesture, in terms of prompt payment of salaries.

She said, “Teachers in the state owe it a duty to be punctual to their duty posts. The present administration has zero tolerance for absenteeism and all forms of indiscipline.”
