Adekunle Peter, Benin

The Vice-Chancellor of Ambrose Alli University, Prof. Ignatius Onimawo, has charged the management staff of the university to improve their productivity.

Onimawo gave the charge during a training organised for selected members of the university’s management staff in Ekpoma, Edo State.

The two-day training, which was aimed at enhancing staff proficiency, productivity and managerial skills, as well as replenish their knowledge of academia, had a legal practitioner, Mr President Aigbokhan, as the guest lecturer.

Aigbokhan, while speaking on the topic, ‘Code of Conduct for Public Officers’, said 95 per cent of Nigerians are liable for prosecution for breaching the provisions of the Code of Conduct Bureau.

He noted that a poor understanding of the letters of 19 commitments to the code was the reason most public office holders committed infractions ignorantly.

He lamented the breakdown of ethical values, conflict in private and public interests, undue exercise of discretions of courts in matters relating to abuse of office and the code of conduct of public officers.

According to him, “95 per cent of public officers in Nigeria are in breach of code of conduct. There is serious victimisation of code of conduct and asset declaration in Nigeria.
