The Proprietress of Lohims Academy in Ojota, Lagos State, Mrs Ogechi Igwagu, has said teaching pupils about the various cultures in Africa and having them replicate it during cultural days, was critical to building their individual identities.

Igwagu made this known recently at the academy’s Sixth Cultural Day celebration where Oluwatobiloba Olusola, a Year 6 pupil, did a rendition of David Diop’s poem, titled, ‘Africa, My Africa’.

She said, “The annual Cultural Day celebration is an expression of the school’s commitment towards providing a wholesome learning experience for pupils which transcends academic work. We are always excited about this event because it offers a platform to showcase Africa’s vibrant culture and an opportunity for us to immerse ourselves in the rich heritage that abounds all across the continent.

“In line with our holistic approach to education, which emphasises the development of the whole individual beyond academics, we expect that initiatives such as the Cultural Day will help our pupils as they shape their self-identities through life and also encourage them to be positive ambassadors of their heritage.”

The ceremony also featured the nursery and primary school pupils’ representation of the Bini, Ijaw and Abiriba cultures of Nigeria; the Zulu and Ndubele cultures of Southern Africa; the Swahili culture of Kenya and the Asante culture of Ghana, amongst others.
