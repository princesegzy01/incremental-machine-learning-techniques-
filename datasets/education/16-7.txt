The Rector, Osun State College of Technology, Esa Oke, Dr Samson Adegoke, has urged retirees and youths to learn a trade to be self-reliant.

He announced the introduction of some new courses in the institution aimed at equipping knowledge seekers with skills.

According to Adegoke, the newly accredited courses include multimedia, design technology, office technology and management, library information and science, agricultural technology, photography, computer engineering and marketing (diploma) and science laboratory technology.

He added that the polytechnic established 26 years ago had only 16 courses before the addition of 11 new ones by the present management.

Giving an insight into how the polytechnic secured accreditation for the courses, Adegoke said, “Our school hosted an 80-man accreditation team from the National Board For Technical Education, Kaduna, recently.

“After the accreditation exercise, we got approval for 11 out of 16 programmes we presented before them. The letter we received from the team stated categorically that we should commence all the programmes from the 2018/2019 academic session.

“We have also approached JAMB on the need to reopen their server for the 2018 /2019 admission for us and they graciously obliged us that, so, our admission is still on for these courses.”
