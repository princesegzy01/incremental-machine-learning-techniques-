Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

A former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Prof. Oye Ibidapo-Obe, has called on the government and individuals to secure the future of the country by increasing funding for education.

Ibidapo-Obe made this known in Ilesha during the presentation of cheques by the Asiwaju Yinka Fasuyi Foundation to pay the exams fees of 250 pupils to sit for the forthcoming West African Senior School Certificate Examination.

He said, “There cannot be good leadership without sound education for people that will form the government. As such, there should be more investment in education. Well-meaning Nigerians should come to the aid of the government by assisting indigent but brilliant pupils to have access to quality education.”

In his remarks, the founder of the NGO, Mr Yinka Fasuyi, said the beneficiaries were drawn from Ilesha East, Ilesha West, Obokun, Oriade, Atakumosa East and Atakumosa West local government areas.

According to him, information was got from the state’s Ministry of Education before selecting the best 250 pupils for the second edition of the scholarship. “Apart from paying for their WASSCE, our foundation will also give 10 branded notebooks to each pupil. We also have the AYFF Tertiary Education Scholarship Scheme for the best 10 of the 100 beneficiaries who received our foundation’s WAEC Education Support Scheme in year 2017/2018 and who have secured admission into tertiary institutions. They will get N100,000 every session until the completion of their respective programmes.”
