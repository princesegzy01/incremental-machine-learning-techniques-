CSS Ipaja alumni donate mosquito nets to pupils
Members of the Command Secondary School, Ipaja, Lagos Alumni Association recently paid a visit to the institution to share treated mosquito nets among its pupils.

Before the visit, the association had elected a new female president, Taiwo Ajisefinni. Less than a week after she was sworn in, she and her executive members took the initiative to protect the pupils from Malaria fever by donating the mosquito nets to them.

“The Health and wellbeing of the pupils, teachers and non-academic staff are of great priority to us,” she said.

A statement from the school Senior Prefect, Linda Umossoh, showed how much the pupils appreciated the gesture of the Alumni. She said, “You don’t know how many people you have prevented from having malaria and visiting the Medical Inspection Room by giving us these nets.”

The commandant of the school, Colonel Y. Ahmed, acknowledged the effort of the association and showered praises on the various projects carried out so far.

Many years after their graduation from the school, the former pupils of the school have in one way or another gone back at various times to make sacrificial donations towards improving the standard of education and the standard of living for both staff and students of the school either individually, as various sets or as a general Alumni body.
