A Non-Governmental Organisation, Ugo Igboukwu Foundation, on Monday awarded scholarships to 173 students of tertiary institutions in 14 communities in the Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State.

Speaking during the foundation’s 14th annual academic award ceremony held on the premises of Central School, Ekwuluobia, its Chairman, Board of Trustees, Dr Gab Mba, decried the neglect in Nigerian public universities.

While calling on stakeholders to fix the affected universities, Mba warned that neglecting the education sector could have a ripple effect on society.

He said, “We may think that what happens in our public schools does not concern us, as long as our children attend standard private schools, but such a miscalculation could be dangerous.

“By the time our children graduate from Oxford and Harvard Universities, they shall come back to meet the vast majority that were ruined in the public schools. And the majority, whether right or wrong, must have their way.”

“In the light of this, we wish to call on town unions, the old boys and girls of our public schools, village unions, clubs and all lovers of our towns and people to always visit our public schools to see where we can be of help.

The scholarship awards followed competitive examinations conducted by the board of the Ugo Igbokwu Foundation.

In his address, the founder of the scholarship, Engineer Bart Nwibe, said the best two beneficiaries in the tertiary institutions would get the sums of N100,000 and N75,000, respectively, with assorted books, while the others will get consolation prizes of N10,000 each.
