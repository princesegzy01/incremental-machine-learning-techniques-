‘Lack of dedicated teachers crippling education’
Tare Youdeowei

The Chief Executive Officer of Tender Age Children’s School, Ebute-Metta, Lagos, Mrs Adebisi Salako, has said that the absence of devoted teachers is seriously affecting teaching and learning in Nigerian schools.

Speaking during the 50th anniversary of the school, Salako called for a complete migration to Montessori and the teaching of presumed difficult subjects in ‘strands’.

She said the school was able to raise dedicated teachers by training them locally and internationally.

“In the educational sector we lack dedicated teachers. This is because teaching is seen as a profession to run to when there are no jobs available. We have teachers who have been dedicated to us for 25 years because we train them both locally and internationally.

“Our school does not teach in the integrated method, we teach in strands. It has brought us this far. We break our subjects into parts for better understanding. A child cannot be bad in Mathematics as a whole, he or she is either good in one strands or another and it encourages them,” the CEO said.

Salako also urged parents to take full responsibility for the development of their children as the school was only a tool for development. She said, “Parents should understand their children. They shouldn’t put the burden of the child on the school.
