Dayo Ojerinde

The Chief Executive Officer, Elrol Global Services Limited, Mrs Chinny Kennedy-Echetebu, has said sports were critical to relaxing children’s brains, reducing anxiety and improving blood circulation.

She made this known at the 25th inter-house sports competition of Corona Secondary School in Agbara, Ogun State.

Kennedy-Echetebu also said sports could improve the academic performance of pupils, building good character, time management and leadership qualities in them.

“Participating in sports is not a waste of time like some people think; it can be a way of life. It has the ability to reduce chronic disease like high blood pressure in people. Many children are Vitamin D deficient because they are no longer doing anything under the sun. Because sports involve risks, it teaches pupils how to take risks. Also, exposing pupils to sports at an early age could improve their chances of making it a career.”

The Principal of the school, Mrs Chinedum Oluwadamilola, who declared the competition open, said it provided an opportunity for the pupils to showcase their talents.

The competition ended with Kingfisher House, Crane House and Weaver House emerging first, second and third respectively.
