The Provost of the Federal Polytechnic, Ile Oluji in Ondo State, Prof. Emmanuel Fasakin, has advised the new students of the institution to embrace entrepreneurial skills aside from the academic programme of the polytechnic.

Fasakin said vocational skills were necessary in the light of scarce white collar jobs in the country, adding that a student with one vocational skill or the other could stand on his own and become an employer of labour after graduating from the institution.

The don stated this while addressing the new students of the school during the third matriculation ceremony on the campus of the institution on Friday.

No fewer than 260 new students took admission oath at the ceremony.

According to him, the polytechnic would expose the students to various entrepreneurship skills which would be of benefit to them.

He said, “I would like to implore you to embrace entrepreneurial skills, it may be that is what you will live on after graduating from school.

“For instance, a student may study engineering here but at the end of the day, it may be one of the skills they acquire that will give them a lifetime job. So I will advise you to utilise the opportunity. The institution is committed to your training and welfare and you will be equipped with necessary skills so that you may become outstanding in your various fields.

“There are opportunities to acquiring entrepreneurial skills during your studentship here, so take advantage of it. “

He also warned the students to shun all social vices, noting that the vices could distract them from achieving their goals in the polytechnic.
