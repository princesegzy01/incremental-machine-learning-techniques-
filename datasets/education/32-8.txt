Varsities must take front row in national conversations, says Gambari
Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

A former Minister for External Affairs, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, has charged universities in the country to take the front row in national conversations.

Gambari also urged the Federal Government to revisit the 2014 Constitutional Conference to allay fears on restructuring and move the country forward.

He said this while giving a lecture, themed, Federalism and the Future of Nigeria: The Challenge of Restructuring, at the maiden Babcock University Public Affairs Forum held in Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State.

Gambari said, “Universities should brainstorm solutions to national and global challenges. The Federal Government should also revisit the 2014 constitutional conference to allay fears on restructuring and move the country forward.”

He, however, called on the government to create ‘safety nets’ that would take care of the underprivileged and handicapped in society. “Since restructuring, nation building and federalism are hinged on the same principles, Nigeria needs to embrace restructuring as a necessity, not an option for survival. You cannot build a nation with increasing inequality. Our constitution should continue to be amended until we get a perfect model,” he said.

On his part, the special guest of honour, Prof. Adele Jinadu, said that Nigerian intellectuals had a duty to become the voice of the people.

Also speaking at the event, the Director of the Nigeria Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies, Prof. Femi Ajayi, who chaired the event, cited weak governance and the absence of credible leadership as factors responsible for Nigeria’s inability to maximize its great potential.
