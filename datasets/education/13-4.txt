About 30 candidates, who had the best results at the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, have been offered scholarships valued at N15m to pursue their higher education in various tertiary institutions.

The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board disclosed this on Sunday in its weekly bulletin, obtained by our correspondent, noting that the scholarships were provided by a commercial bank, Stanbic IBTC.

According to JAMB, the bank’s Corporate Investment Banking and Marketing Manager, Mrs Bridget Oyefeso-Odusami, stated this when she led the bank’s delegation to the JAMB Headquarters, in Bwari, Abuja.

The candidates must have scored a minimum of 250 and above in the 2019 UTME, possess five credit passes in their Ordinary Level results as well as meet other specified criteria necessary for admission.
