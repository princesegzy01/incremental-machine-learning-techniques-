Ansar-Ud-Deen College gets girls’ hostel
Ansar-Ud-Deen College, Isolo, Lagos State, has constructed a 250-bed female hostel as part of efforts to provide a better and conducive learning atmosphere for its pupils.

The project, which was facilitated by the Board of Governors of the school, was unveiled on Thursday at the school compound.

Speaking during the commissioning, the Principal, Mr Tajudeen Adebambo, said the building was proof of the school’s commitment to the provision of infrastructure, which he described as critical to the teaching and learning process.

The Chairman, Board of Governors, Mr Dapo Sofola, while congratulating the school for the facility, said the school was focused on providing an adequate and conducive learning environment for its pupils because it would impact positively on their academic activities.

He said, “With this facility, the pupils have a better and conducive environment for learning. It is not suffering and smiling while learning that matters; it is learning in an environment where you can assimilate and adopt whatever you have been taught.

“This will definitely enhance the learning ability of the pupils and encourage them to settle down and learn. Everything they need to be all-around pupils is provided in this facility and we implore them to make good use of it for their success.

“The facility is 100 per cent funded by the Ansar-Ud-Deen community. If you were here when we took over in 2007, you can imagine what quantum leap that we have achieved now. Now, we have down very well, in terms of putting a tangible structure in place for the students. “
