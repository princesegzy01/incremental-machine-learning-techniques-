Ekiti seeks partnership to reposition technical education
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Chairman of the Ekiti State Board for Technical and Vocational Education, Kayode Babade, has said that all efforts must be made to ensure the realisation of Governor Kayode Fayemi’s vision of bringing back the lost glory of technical education and making the state a role model in technical education.

Babade also urged groups and individuals to partner towards equipping pupils to learn a trade and become employers of labour.

He spoke on Wednesday when he led members of the board on an advocacy visit to media organisations in the state with a view to partnering to promote public education. “Today the world is surrounded by technical education experts. Any nation that is lagging behind in this respect is dead and we want our people to understand that. Today, you are a better person when you can use your hands.”

Babade revealed that about N1.8bn had been spent on the technical college in Ado-Ekiti, while the remaining three colleges would soon be brought back to life. “Fayemi is determined to revitalise the colleges to ensure that youths are fully engaged to use their brains and hands so that they can be self-employed and employers of labour. The youth should embrace technical and technological education.”
