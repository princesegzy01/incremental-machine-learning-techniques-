The Provost, Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education, Ijanikin, Lagos State, Dr Omolola Ladele, has said all the courses offered in the college have been fully accredited by the National Commission for Colleges of Education.

Ladele said this during the matriculation of 1,300 students into full-time NCE programmes for the 2018/2019 academic session.

During the 2018 accreditation, the college and all its 31 programmes were fully accredited by the NCCE. By these giant strides, the college has charted a new course preparatory for the next level. With the accreditation, the college is able to further bring critical innovations in teacher education programmes to tackle issues of unemployment, half-baked graduates, poverty, corruption, violence and other social menaces,” Ladele said.

She added that the college was committed to providing quality teacher education, as skilled teachers were not only crucial to the country’s economic growth but they also determined the country’s capacity to attain the Sustainable Development Goals.
