Don calls for synergy between research institutions, private sector
Adekunle Peter, Benin

The Chief Lecturer of the Department of Mechanical Engineering in Edo State Polytechnic, Usen, Dr Obokhia Asikhia, has called for implementation of effective measures to enhance collaboration between research institutions and the private sector in order to promote local content.

Asikhia, who made the call during an interview with our correspondent, said a lot needed to be done in research institutions, such as universities and polytechnics to bridge the gap, especially in engineering technology.

He added that the cause of problems with machines made locally was the inability to integrate effective user-friendly features for optimal use, which often caused disuse in the long run.

“Only robust collaboration between industries and research institutions can boost industrialisation. There is a need to work on making use of machines simpler. I have a few compilations of some facilities – everyday products and mainstream massive industries – that I have identified that can be improved on in terms of ease of use.

“I have seen some massive designs that are highly sophisticated, but the interaction aspect of the use of the products has not been well managed. This has resulted in user apathy towards the use of the facilities,” Asikhia said.
