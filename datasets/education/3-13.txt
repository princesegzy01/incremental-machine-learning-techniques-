The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria has given clinical accreditation to the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo town, Ondo State.

With the approval of UNIMED’s programmes, our correspondent gathered, the university can now conduct second MBBS/BDS Professional Pathology and Pharmacology Examination for its 500 level medical and dental students.

The Vice-Chancellor of the UNIMED, Prof Friday Okonofua, disclosed this to the members of the staff of the institution at a meeting held on Monday.

Clearly pleased with the development, Okofua said the Registrar of the MDCN, Dr

Tajudeen Sanusi, had sent a congratulatory letter to the university on the clinical accreditation, following the report of the verification team of the council to the UNIMED on August 19, 2019.

The vice-chancellor said, “We are here to train our students. If we don’t do this and our students are not moving forward, everybody will be depressed. I am very happy that we have this accreditation for the next five years.

“Any accreditation we get now will be for five years, at least. During this period, we can begin to expand our facilities so that when the MDCN verification team comes again, it will have no reason not to accredit us. And a good foundation would be laid.”

He commended all the staff of the university for their contributions before and during the visit of the MDCN verification team. He explained that all members of staff had contributed in one way or the other to the success of the institution’s efforts to get its programmes accredited.
