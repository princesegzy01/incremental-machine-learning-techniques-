Oyetunji Abioye

To tackle the phobia many have of Mathematics, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Educraft Nigeria Limited, Mr Napoleon Omiunu, has advised schools in the country to imbibe the culture of Abacus Mathematics and Brain Gym classes for pupils.

According to him, through this strategy, the phobia of Mathematics among pupils would be a thing of the past.

He said, “Abacus learning device is good at the early stage in schools to completely eradicate the phobia associated with calculating big numbers.”

Omiunu, who gave the recommendation during the Abacus presentation at an event organised recently for pupils of Redeemers International Schools, Apapa, Lagos, said that what Abacus does ultimately is to break these big numbers to figures and put them in value placements.

He continued, “Abacus is a calculating device that can help children beat the challenges of calculating and working with big numbers.

“Abacus has penciled down the truth that children are scared of big numbers. So what it does is to break these big numbers to figures and put them in value placements.

“With that, children will be able to work the basic tens, units of hundreds and thousands number placements and their calculations will be easier.”

Also commenting on the Abacus learning device, the Administrator of the school, Mrs Olufunke Owolana, said she watched the pupils of her school perform excellently during an Abacus presentation, saying that “I can’t find a better word to use, it is beyond my expectation.”
