An online test platform, Success Box, has announced that its users who scored 343 and above in the 2018 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination will share a cash reward of N2m.

The initiative, introduced by Chronicles Software Development Company, enables students to prepare online with over 50,000 questions and answers.

The Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr Oluwakoyejo Oluwatosin, disclosed this at the award ceremony held recently in Lagos for key leaders and excellent administrators in the educational sector.

According to a statement made available by the company, Oluwatosin said the company’s goal is to empower over one million JAMB candidates with a robust testing platform to enable them better prepare and achieve excellence in the 2019 unified tertiary matriculation exams.

He explained that the online platform provided an instant scoring mechanism, random question generation, past question bank spanning 15 years and a post-test performance review, among others.

Oluwatosin said, “So far, the company seems to be heading in the right direction as the number of subscribers continues to grow in the recently upgraded robust online test platform. Success Box offers students a platform to practice seamlessly for UTME and WASSCE.

“Success Box is purpose built and it will operate as a web-enabled, mobile-friendly portal, while increasing the server bandwidth based on demands. It will also provide additional support to over one million users. The solution will enable more examination candidates to have access to high-quality preparatory materials in the most cost-effective way.”
