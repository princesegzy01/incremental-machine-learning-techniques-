The National Examinations Council has said that 290,274 candidates who sat for its 2018 June/July examination failed to make five credits, including in both English Language and Mathematics.

The NECO said that out of a total of 1,032,729 candidates who took the examination, 742,455, which represented 71.5 per cent, had five credits and above, including English Language and Mathematics.

According to a statement obtained by our correspondent on Thursday, the Acting Registrar of NECO, Mr Abubakar Gana, who announced the results, said the council released the results 40 days after the examination to enable candidates meet the deadline for admission into higher institutions.

Gana said NECO was undergoing a lot of reforms to ensure more efficiency, noting that the 2018 examination results showed 0.63 per cent improvement from 2017.

The registrar said, “1,041,536 candidates registered for the 2018 examination while 1,032,729 candidates sat for the examination. Also, 939,733 candidates who represented 90.5 per cent scored five credits and above without English and Mathematics.

“875, 464 candidates, representing 84.8 per cent scored credits in English Language, while 850,331 candidates representing 82.3 per cent scored credits in Mathematics. A total of 742,455 candidates representing 71.5 per cent scored five credits and above, including English Language and Mathematics. This leaves 290,274 candidates without five credits, including either in English Language or Mathematics.

“The result further showed that in 2017, 70.9 per cent of candidates had five credits and above including English and Mathematics as against 71.5 per cent in 2018. This shows 0.63 per cent improved performance in the current result.”

The registrar said as part of enhancing efficiency in NECO, the council had commenced an implementation of a “manpower development plan” for its workers by a Ministerial Committee headed by Muhammed Umar, a former Director of Human Resources at the Federal Ministry of Education.

“This plan is being implemented through internal postings and transfer of personnel based on their areas of specialisation to ensure efficiency in the council’s operations. With the reforms being implemented, NECO is fast taking its place as a reliable examination management body,” Gana noted.
