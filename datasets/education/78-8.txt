Femi Makinde, Osogbo

The Secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association, Ilesa branch, Mr Olayinka Sokoya, has called on the management of the Obafemi Awolowo, to work hard to ensure a quick restoration of the accreditation of the Faculty of Law and other programmes whose accreditations were suspended by the National Universities Commission.

The NBA scribe, in an interview with our correspondent, said, “The OAU is a great university and the suspension of accreditation of these programmes will affect applicants, who applied for them.

“So, I want to urge the management of the university to do everything possible to get the accreditation back.”

Also, a former student of the school, who is a governorship candidate of the Socialists Party of Nigeria, Mr. Alfred Adegoke, told our correspondent that the withdrawal of accreditation of the Faculty of Law was a signal of the magnitude of the crisis in the education sector in the country.

Adegoke blamed the management of the OAU for the suspension of the accreditations, saying they had failed in the discharge of their primary duties.

He said, “OAU was a shining light in legal jurisprudence and legal education. What is happening now is a shock to some of us. The suspension of the accreditation of Law and other courses is a signal of the crisis in the education sector in Nigeria.”
