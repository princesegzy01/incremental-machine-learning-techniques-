The Vice-Chancellor of the Ondo State University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, Ondo State, Prof. Sunday Ogunduyile, has said that the National Universities Commission formally approved nine additional programmes of the institution.

Ogunduyile said the newly accredited programmes were Biology, Computer Science, Geophysics, Industrial Chemistry, Mathematics, Microbiology, Physics, Zoology and Fisheries.

Addressing journalists in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Monday, the vice-chancellor explained that NUC granted accreditation to the programmes in January 2019, following a visit by the commission’s accreditation team to the institution between October and November 2018.

He also said that there was a high-level infrastructure deficit in the university, but the recent intervention by the current administration in the state had rescued the institution.

Stating that the university used to be a one-faculty institution, the VC said, “Since I came here, about two years ago, we have established the faculties of Agriculture, Food, Science and Technology, Agricultural Technology and the Department of Statistics.

“This translates into more openings for more students to be offered admission. We are not stopping there. We are in the process of establishing Marine Engineering, Geology and Petroleum and Gas, with the support of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and the university’s Governing Council. We are already working on it.”

Ogunduyile also said that OSUSTECH had been enlisted in the Tertiary Education Trust Fund and the institution was collaborating with four foreign organisations for further transformation.
