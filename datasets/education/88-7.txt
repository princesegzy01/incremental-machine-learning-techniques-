Sex claim: UNILAG calls for memoranda
Chux Ohai

The University of Lagos authorities have set up a fact-finding panel to investigate the recent alleged case of sexual harassment involving a female student and a lecturer in the Department of English and Literary Studies at the institution.

This was made known in a statement signed by the Principal Assistant Registrar, Comunication Unit, Mrs. Taiwo Oloyede, and made available to our correspondent on Friday.

The panel in turn called for memoranda from members of the university community, including the institution’s staff and students, as well as the general public.

It directed the call to those who have useful information on the allegation and any other one, which could aid its assignment to address the memoranda to the “Secretary, Fact Finding Panel on the Allegation of Sexual Harassment involving a Lecturer in the University, c/o Registrar’s Office”, and submit to the 5th Floor, Senate Building, University of Lagos.

With a promise to guarantee the confidentiality of respondents, the panel also requested that the memoranda be in sealed envelopes and submitted between June 11 and 15.

The management of the university said its decision was in line with its zero tolerance for such allegations.
