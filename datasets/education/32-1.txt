Ogbonna Casmir, Enugu

The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nigeria Nsukka,Prof. Benjamin Ozumba on Monday said he was happy that he was leaving the university better than he met it five years ago.

Ozumba, whose five-year tenure as the 14th vice-chancellor of the university will end on June 14, spoke during a briefing to flag-off his end of tenure activities at the Princess Alexandra Auditorium, Nsukka.

He said, “Before I became the VC in 2014, the university was listed as dysfunctional but today and for the third consecutive year since 2016, UNN has been ranked by Webometric as the number one university in Nigeria. Our enviable position as the best in research publications is till very evident among the top 1,500 universities in the world.

“The backlog of programmes and courses requiring accreditation were cleared under my tenure, most faculties and departments had no accreditation buttoday the story is different as the over 100 academic programmes running in this university are fully accredited.”

The VC also disclosed that under his stewardship the Faculty of Vocational and Technical Education and the Faculty of Basic Medical Science were created.”New institutions established are Resources and Environmental Policy Research Centre and the African Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Power and Energy Development. The Distance and e-learning programme was also established and duly accredited by National Universities Commission.”

On staff welfare, Ozumba said the staff enjoyed regular and prompt payment of salaries, adding that the backlog of promotions for stagnated members of staff were cleared within his time in office.
