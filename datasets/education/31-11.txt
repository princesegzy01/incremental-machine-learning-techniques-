Students dominate Nigeria’s drug abuse population – Bowen VC
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Vice-Chancellor of Bowen University in Iwo, Osun State, Prof. Joshua Ogunwole, has decried the rising incidence of drug abuse in tertiary institutions of learning nationwide, saying that a large percentage of the estimated 14.3million drug abusers in the country were youths in tertiary institutions.

Ogunwole said this at the unveiling of the Bode Akindele Yield Initiative held in the institution last Friday.

“Virtually every university, polytechnic and other higher institutions in Nigeria, whether we like it or not, is battling with drug and substance abuse either quietly or openly. It is alarming that out of the 14.3 million Nigerians said to be indulging in drug abuse, a large number comprises youths who are mostly students. This is capable of destroying the most productive parts of one’s life,” the VC said.

He added that the university had zero tolerance for drug abuse and would continue to maintain the punitive measures put in place to curb the menace despite pleas from some quarters, as well as continue to partner with organisations that share the same vision of ending drug abuse.

The Executive Director of Bode Akindele YieId Initiative, Tunji Agboola, said stakeholders had been focusing on the moral implications of drug abuse rather than on the damning consequences of indulging in the act, as he enjoined the participants to keep away from drugs.

Agboola said the group would help to inspire students to properly channel their energy, inquisitiveness and creativity into innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership, while building life skills against drug abuse and others vices.
