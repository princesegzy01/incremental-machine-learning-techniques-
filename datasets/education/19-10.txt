‘Continuous teachers’ training vital for effective teaching’
Dayo Ojerinde

The Chairperson of the Association of Primary School Head Teachers of Nigeria, Surulere branch, Dr Margaret Oguntimehin, has said continuous training of teachers was vital in delivering quality teaching to the pupils.

Oguntimehin said this in Lagos on Monday at a two-day classroom management and lesson plan guide training organised by the Surulere Local Government Authority in partnership with the British Council.

She stated that teachers must improve their knowledge to help them better teachers, adding that the effect of a teachers’ training reflects on the pupils.

“Training will help our teachers to elevate their standard of teaching. When you train the teacher, you train a nation. If we want to produce graduates that are dynamic, we have to be willing to train teachers.

“Whatever procedure that must be taken to develop a child must be taken seriously. The education system under Surulere LGA is child-centred and that is what this training is about. We intend to give the children the best.”

The president of the Nigerian Academic, United Kingdom, Mr Adedamola Aminu, stated that the training was organised to give back to the country.

He said, “The essence of today’s training is to come back and give to our motherland – Nigeria. We are also here to work with our colleagues in Nigeria. We are here to improve their knowledge in the classroom management and lesson plan guide training. The knowledge is necessary because they will also pass it to other teachers and the students.”
