ASUSS backs bill on elongation of service years
Abiodun Nejo, Ado-Ekiti

The Academic Staff Union of Secondary Schools has thrown its weight behind the bill seeking elongation of the tenure of its members.

ASUSS said that the same argument of competence, capacity and expertise that influenced the 70 years retirement age for university teachers also applied to the situation in the secondary school manpower.

In a communique released at the end of its National Central Working Committee meeting held in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, the union also urged the Federal Government to, as a matter of urgency, begin the implementation of the Secondary Education Commission Act of 1999.

ASUSS stated, “The establishment of the Secondary Education Commission as provided in the Act is a fundamental measure to address some of the issues in the management of secondary education.

“The Union calls for adherence with the presidential directive of 2014 on the implementation of the Act.

“ASUSS also calls on the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) to halt the ongoing illegal deductions of secondary schools teachers’ salary.

“The also charges the TRCN to remain neutral and be fair to all unions in the discharge of its duties and stop being evasive to its leadership,” the communiqué stated.
