Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi

The Deeper Life Bible Church has said it will organise a conference for more than 1,000 Christian teachers in Bauchi State.

The State Overseer of the Church, Adeniyi Hassan, who is also the convener of the conference, disclosed this to journalists at a briefing held in Bauchi.

Hassan said the conference, scheduled to hold on Saturday, November 2, would be declared open by the Commissioner for Education in the state, Dr. Aliyu Tilde.

He added that the conference, themed, ‘Teachers’ role in raising tomorrow’s leaders’, would be anchored by seasoned Christian ministers and experienced teachers for the participants’ maximum benefit.

Stressing that the conference was informed by the importance of equipping and positioning teachers for their role in the larger society, he said, “Tomorrow’s leaders must be raised by today’s teachers the way Mordecai raised up Esther, who became the instrument of national liberation for her people.

“It is a state-wide event that will bring together Christian teachers in primary and secondary schools in the state. The teacher is very important because he affects, influences and shapes the future of tomorrow’s leaders. Therefore it is important to envision and equip him to produce all other professionals.

“The teacher must be given his place in society. This conference will also empower the participants to understand the value of his or her God-given role in the society.”
