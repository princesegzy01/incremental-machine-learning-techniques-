The Vice-Chancellor of Igbinedion University, Okada, Prof. Lawrence Ezemonye, has disclosed that the university has been admitted into the CISCO Academy.

Ezemonye made this known during the opening ceremony of a workshop for staff and students of the university on networking.

He described CISCO as a world-class Information Technology institution that deals with the production of IT equipment for networking.

The VC also said the premier private university had created a smart campus that allowed students to excel in an environment driven by IT that prepares them for the future.

“The essence of the workshop was to make the students acquire skills that would transform them into entrepreneurs. The interests of students are uppermost in the minds of the management, that is why the university ensures that these opportunities are made available for students to update themselves,” he said.

Ezemonye further disclosed that the university was working out modalities for the establishment of Cyber-Engineering Security as a course of study.

The representative of CISCO in South-South Nigeria, Engr Daniel Ekpah, said CISCO had recorded more success at the university than at any other university, with up to 60 participants registered for the training.
