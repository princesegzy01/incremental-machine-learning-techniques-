The Chief Executive Officer, Supreme Education Foundation Schools, Mrs Olubukola Adewuyi, has said that experiential learning is critical to enable pupils to adapt to current trends in education.

She made this known at the school’s 25th Valedictory Service and Graduation Ceremony, while speaking on the theme, ‘Paragons of Global Change’.

Adewuyi said, “Academics is not what it used to be in the 21st century. The skills needed are totally different. It is not just the boxes of literacy, numeracy or science, it is about what change you can bring to the society and this is what Nigeria needs. It has become imperative for education experts to develop innovative and dynamic approaches to enhance educational service delivery. One major effective way to achieve this is through experiential learning for students to enable them adapt to current trends in education.

“Experiential learning for the children should be compulsory, especially from year nine. Students should be exposed to internship, which is very important, as whatever skills they learn in the classroom will be applied to their everyday life.”

The ceremony saw the Assistant Head Boy, Ayomide Adetunji, emerge as the 2018 Best Graduating Student. Ayomide had, while still a pupil in the school, come out tops in the Canadian Maths Challenge and Coding Contest, Australian Big Science Competition, National Olympiads, Nigeria Spelling Bee Competition and the first Global Robotics Olympics in Washington D.C. He was also the Bronze recipient of the Duke of Edinburgh International Award for Young People, among other international awards.
