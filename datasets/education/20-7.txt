FUOYE to commence distance learning
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Vice-Chancellor, Federal University, Oye Ekiti, Prof. Kayode Soremekun, said on Saturday that the institution was planning to change into a dual-mode to combine existing conventional academic programmes with Distance Learning Programme.

Soremekun said he had held several meetings with the Commonwealth of Learning in Vancouver, Canada, with a view to achieving the feat.

He said, “I have visited COL and held a series of meetings with the organisation. The matters discussed were focused on developing FUOYE with regards to quality assurance, employability and the strategy to transit FUOYE into a dual-mode university.

“Dual-mode means that we are complementing our existing orthodox programmes with the Distance Learning Programme.”

According to him, running a distance learning programme would expand the scope of scholarship around the globe through access to university education and exchange programme among commonwealth universities.

COL is an intergovernmental organisation established by the Commonwealth Heads of Government in 1988 for enhancing the quality of educational programmes of Commonwealth nations and to encourage the development and sharing of open learning and distance education knowledge and resources.
