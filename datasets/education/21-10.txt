Chima Azubuike, Gombe

The United States Agency for International Development, through its education-funded project tagged, ‘Strengthening Education in Northeast’, has stated its resolve to train education managers and primary schoolteachers in Gombe State.

The state team lead of SENSE, Malam Ishiaku Babayo, made this known recently at a meeting with the state governor, Inuwa Yahaya, where he disclosed that the project aimed at developing the capacity of primary education managers in using data for informed decision-making and improved school systems.

“This is in close collaboration with key stakeholders in the primary education system such as Local Education Authority, the Ministry of Education, State Universal Basic Education Board, Teachers Service Commission and Teacher Training Institute in the state to train about 100 education managers and 5,000 primary school teachers within a three-year period. The first phase of the project has identified three local government areas in the three senatorial zones of Gombe State with six schools from each of the identified LGAs,” Babayo said.

On his part, the governor reiterated that education remained a top priority of his administration, as he lauded the initiative by the USAID and AUN to support education and good governance.

Yahaya said, “The SENSE project intervention in Gombe State is timely. We will ensure that its impact manifests within the targeted period. This administration came on board with a mission of change and hope to better the lives of the citizenry through an improved educational system and other socio economic sectors despite the challenges on the ground.”
