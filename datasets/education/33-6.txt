The Vice-Chancellor of Imo State University, Owerri, Prof Adaobi Obasi, has announced the acquisition of three new hostels for its students.

Speaking during the 27th matriculation of the institution held recently on the main campus of the institution, the Obasi said that with the acquisition, IMSU, which was officially a non-residential institution, had now become residential.

The vice-chancellor told the new students that they should count themselves lucky to be the first set of undergraduates to occupy the brand new hostels, two of which were set aside to shelter the female students.

Advising the new students to take their studies very seriously, she said, “IMSU aims at encouraging the advancement of learning in Imo state in particular and Nigeria at large and holding out to all persons (students) irrespective of race, creed or sex the opportunity to acquire higher education.

“Other goals of the institution include ensuring the publication and dissemination of results of academic and professional researches and discoveries, as well as to provide appropriate community service to humanity”.

She thanked TETFUND, the Federal Ministry of Education and the Niger Delta Development Commission for funding the construction of various new faculty buildings in the university.

Obasi also warned that the university had zero tolerance for secret cults, indecent dressing, examination malpractice, misconduct, impersonation and lateness.
