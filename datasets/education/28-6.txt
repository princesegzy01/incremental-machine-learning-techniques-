Kwara’ll join school feeding program — Abdulrazaq
Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin

The Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, has said the state would join the National School Feeding Programme once he was done studying it.

Abdulrazaq, who spoke on Wednesday during a special meeting with party leaders and members in Ilorin, the state capital, disclosed, “We have met with the coordinator of the programme on how the state can join. So, we will definitely join after we have studied it. This administration would always consult with the party and the people before taking decisions on issues in a bid to ensure consensus and inclusiveness.”

Lamenting the zero representation of women in the House of Assembly, the governor promised to compensate women with appointments and properly engage the youths as part of efforts to build a viable state.

Abdulrazaq also pledged to embark on massive infrastructural development, especially in the Northern Senatorial District, which he said had long been neglected.

He thanked the Transition Committee for a wonderful job, as he revealed, “What we thought we knew about the rot was a child’s play. While we are still studying their huge report, it is clear we were wrong on the extent of the damage done to our state. We are in a deeper mess than we thought but we will face it and move our state forward.”

The All Progressives Congress’ Chairman in the state, Bashir Bolarinwa, commended the governor for identifying with the party so early in his administration, as he called on party members to support the new governor in the interest of the state.
