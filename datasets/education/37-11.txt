The Sigma Club of the University of Ibadan has awarded 10 scholarships to indigent first class student of the university to encourage their academic performance.

During an event at the UI Alumni Centre on Saturday, each of the beneficiaries was awarded the sum of N100,000 to be received annually until the completion of their undergraduate programmes.

Aside from the scholarship, the winners were also conferred with honorary membership as ‘Sigma Scholar’ of the all male club.

The Sigma Chief, Mr Valentine Igbonekwu, explained that the scholarship which covered the tuition fees, accommodation and other academic expenses, would be paid into the school’s account and each beneficiary would receive the balance as cash at the beginning of each session.

Igbonekwu said, “The scheme is an initiative of our club aimed at helping to solve some of the challenges in the educational sector by rewarding brillant but indigent students by providing scholarships to enable them complete their education and actualise their academic goals.

“The scholarship is worth N100,000 annually per beneficiary, and shall cover tuition and accommodation.

“The Sigma Scholarship Scheme was established in 1986 and since then about 87 students have benefitted from the scheme. This gesture is in continuation of the club’s noble tradition of philanthropy which is aimed at improving the lives of people in our immediate environment, as well as causing an uplift in humanity.”
