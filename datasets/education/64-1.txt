‘Fund education sector to meet UN standard’
Oluwatosin Omojuyigbe

A top executive in one of the new generation banks, Tolu Ogundipe, has urged the Federal Government to invest in the education sector to meet the United Nations minimum standard.

He made the appeal in Lagos at the presentation of a book titled, ‘Stand out: Principle of academic success.’

According to Ogundipe, the economy of the country would be better if the government increased the fund allocated to the education sector.

He said, “The government should think of youth empowerment. To educate the citizens of the country, there must be good quality education at almost free rate for everybody.

“The government should fund the educational sector with billions to meet the United Nations standard of a minimum of 25 per cent in the education sector and I am sure that if the government can do that for the next 10 years, the country will be where it ought to be.

“At any given opportunity the government has, the quality of our education must be improved. If we have more literate people, the economy will be sane, and the politics will also be sane.”

He added that the government should fund researchers to proffer solutions to existing problems.

The author of the book, Michael Demehin, urged youths to invest in themselves to contribute positively to the country. Copyright PUNCH.
