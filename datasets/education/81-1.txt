Oyo govt lauded on school management initiative
Olufemi Atoyebi, Ibadan

The Oyo State Government has been commended for the establishment of governing councils saddled with the responsibility of managing secondary schools in the state.

Speaking at the national convention of Mount Olivet Grammar School Alumni Association of Nigeria, son of the school’s founder, Bishop Michael Onabanjo, said involvement of stakeholders and other relevant partners in the running of the schools would bring back quality education and good standard which were lost over the years because of neglect and poor funding after government took over missionary and private schools in the state.

According to Onabanjo, old pupils had a greater role to play in the running of the schools, stressing that government must not be left to run the schools alone.

He said, “The effort of the Oyo State government to improve on the standard of education in our schools is commendable.

Old pupils and other stakeholders must stand up and complement government effort towards promoting quality education in the school. Public/private partnership in the running of schools allows for diverse opinions in reaching a solution and bringing progress to the problems of education sector in our society. Government, home and religious organisations are three institutions that are important in the upbringing of a child.

“The founder of Olivet Grammar School was a great philanthropist whose vision and life goal of establishing a school to assist the less privileged acquired education was unique in all ways. Several years later when the government took over all private and missionary schools, Mount Olivet was not exempted.”
