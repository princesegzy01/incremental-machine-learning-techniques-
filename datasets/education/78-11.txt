Blame Oyo, Osun govts for LAUTECH collapse – ASUU
Olufemi Atoyebi, Ibadan

The Academic Staff Union of University, Ladoke Akintola University of Technology Ogbomoso, has urged members of the public to hold the governments of Oyo and Osun, who are the joint-owners of the institution, responsible, if the institution collapses as a result of their failure to live up to expectation.

In a statement signed jointly signed by the chairman of the chapter, Biodun Olaniyan, and the secretary, Toyin Abegunrin, ASUU said infrastructural decay, non-payment of staff salaries, occasioned by poor funding from the two states, were some of the major problems facing the school.

It warned that after the two governments refused to take welfare of the staff serious, a total strike could be declared on Wednesday.

The statement said, “Recall that the ASUU, LAUTECH branch in the press statement of the July 26, 2018 warned about the impeding crises in the university due to governments’ refusal to fund the institution as part of their cardinal responsibilities to the Nigerian masses.

“This has led to the accumulation of unpaid salaries. Prompt payment of salaries, which is a major motivating ingredient of productivity, has become a mirage in our erstwhile glorious and exemplary university, which in the past was the glory of Oyo and Osun states.”
