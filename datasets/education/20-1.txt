‘Salvage deplorable schools’
Tare Youdeowei

The Proprietor of Tom Caleb Schools, Mr Tom Maugbe, has called on the Federal Government to salvage deteriorating schools in the Country.

Maugbe, made the call on last Wednesday during the 33rd graduation ceremony of the school in Lagos, pointing out that the education sector had not meet the needs of the people.

According to him, “The quality of education in Nigeria is down. The education sector doesn’t meet the needs of society anymore. The people in authority must fund the sector. They must do away with all forms of deception and make the development obvious by providing educational materials and improving training.”

The proprietor also queried the mode of appointing teachers in the country as he hinged the failure of the sector on the lack of qualified teachers.

“Some states do not even employ teachers at all; the few that do, make it look like a political appointment and employ people who are not fit for classrooms. We are joking with our future leaders; any country messing with the future leaders will have no future,” Maugbe said.

The Principal of Ilupeju Senior Grammar School, Ms Esther Jesugbamila, advised the pupils to face the larger society with a positive attitude. “Your attitude goes a long way to make or mar you. Build the right attitude towards life and live up to expectation. That is what we lack in this part of the world.”

She also advised parents to encourage their wards in their academic pursuits, not minding if they are fast or slow learners.
