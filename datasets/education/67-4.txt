Ted Odogwu, Kano

A new private university, focusing on research, creativity and entrepreneurship Studies, was on Monday inaugurated in the commercial city of Kano.

The institution, known as Skyline University, which would be driven by modern technology, commenced its maiden orientation yesterday, for the new set of students, totaling about 160.

Speaking with journalists, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Prana Krishna, described the university, which was established in 1990 in the United Arab Emirate, as the first private university in the state.

Krishna said the university was founded to complement the Federal Governmentâ€™s efforts toward providing qualitative education for the youths in the state, including the region at large, so as to measure up, with their counterparts from the other parts of the country.

In addition, he disclosed, the university would provide other community services, as part of its social corporate responsibilities, stressing that, such role, would be inculcated in the new students to enable them learn how to contribute to the society after graduating from school through the government, Civil Society or through their private Businesses.

The vice-chancellor also said that the institution, which had 50 of its courses approved by the Nigerian University Commission, would formally kick off with 200 students by January 2019
