The Edo University in Iyamho, Edo State, has matriculated 450 students for the 2018/2019 academic session.

The ceremony, held on Thursday on the school premises, was the fourth for the state-owned university which, according to its Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Emmanuel Aluyor, had made a big impact within its three years of existence.

Aluyor said the institution was ranked third among the country’s state-owned universities in the 2018 Open Educational Resources ranking of Nigerian universities by the National Universities Commission.

He said, “This university is among the first to own an Anatomage, which is the most advanced digital device for training medical students in Anatomy; we are also the first in Nigeria and West Africa to acquire the CANVAS Learning Management System for teaching.”

Aluyor advised the new students to make the best use of the facilities available in the university to become well-grounded and employable after graduation.

He warned them that the institution would not tolerate any indiscipline, smoking or possession of hard drugs on the university’s premises, adding that such could lead to expulsion.
