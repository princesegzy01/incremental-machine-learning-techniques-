Don seeks functional laboratories to boost research, revenue
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

A professor of Microbiology at Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, Titilayo Femi-Ola, has advocated the establishment of functional central laboratory and as well installation of functional laboratory equipment in the university.

Femi-Ola said such laboratory and proper equipment would encourage and aid EKSU post-graduate students in their researches and as well serve as a source of revenue generation for the institution.

The don, who spoke at EKSU on Friday while delivering her inaugural address titled ‘Microbes: Their Symbiotic Roles as BioProcessors,’ said lack of functional laboratories had been the bane of researches in many Nigerian institutions.

She said, “I want to plead for a functional central laboratory. This will boost the morale of researchers yearning for problem-solving research.

“Installation of very paramount equipment that takes out postgraduate students to neighbouring institutions where they pay through their noses could be a source of revenue for the university.”

Femi-Ola, who said that “the diversity of microorganisms and their metabolic activities should be properly harnessed for the purpose of national development,” added that the importance of functional laboratories in achieving this could not be over-emphasized.
