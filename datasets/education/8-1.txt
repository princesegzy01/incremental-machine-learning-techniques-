‘Kano free education covers tuition only’
Ted Odogwu, Kano

The Kano State Government on Wednesday said the newly declared free and compulsory education in the state was only for the provision of school fees, instructional materials and infrastructure.

Parents and guardians, it noted, are expected to buy exercise books, text books and sew school uniforms for their children and wards.

The Permanent Secretary in the State Ministry of Education, Hajiya Loritu Disso, made the clarification in Kano, while reacting to parents who insisted that the state government should buy books and sew uniforms for the pupils.

Disso argued that if it were possible for all the development partners to always contribute their quota toward complementing government’s efforts in the education sector, parents ought to follow suit.

‘’Does it mean that parents in Kano State would just fold their arms, send their children to school because the state government has declared free and compulsory education without exercise books and uniforms?

“The uniforms supplied by the government are only meant for pupils in Primary One, which will come up at end of September. Parents need to provide money for the purchase of uniforms, as well as Mathematics and English text books.

“The state government will provide instructional materials for the teachers. The instructional materials and text books of the students are different.’’
