Consistent academic excellence stands ICAST out – Principal
The Principal of International College of Arts, Science and Technology in Ibadan, Oyo State, Mr Oyelowo Olanrewaju, has said the school stands out from other schools because of its consistent record of academic excellence.

Olanrewaju made this known in a statement on Thursday where he expressed delight that the school, established by Chief Dotun Sanusi, almost a decade ago, had continued to grow in leaps and bounds because the proprietor ensured the ‘ship of ICAST kept sailing pleasantly’.

He said. “This year’s Senior Secondary Certificate Examination result shows that the administrators of ICAST schools have long made academic excellence their watchword. This is evident in the sterling performance of our graduating pupils as they shone in this year’s examination.

“The consistent academic excellence at ICAST might seem ordinarily unachievable but the success recorded year in year out is deeply rooted in the divine amidst the effort of the teachers and pupils. As at the time of preparing for the examination, we knew the pupils were stressed as a result of the rigorous drilling but we kept encouraging them and at the end, success came at last.”

Olanrewaju also said ICAST could boast having one of the best science laboratories in the state, as well as the commitment of teachers who worked not for the salary alone, but for God’s sake.

He added that despite the increasing rate of pupils’ enrolment in ICAST schools, the management had maintained the global standard of the teacher to pupils ratio and had continued to invest heavily in the expansion of the school, as well as invest in sports infrastructure for the all around development of the pupils.
