Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

Students of the Imo state Polytechnic, Umuagwo, on Monday staged a demonstration on the Owerri- Port Harcourt Expressway to protest against the killing of three of their colleagues by a speeding truck.

The students claimed that the deceased were knocked down by the driver of the vehicle on Sunday and they died instantly. They lamented the recurring deaths of their fellow students due to reckless driving on the part of the impatient motorists who ply the expressway.

The students urged the Federal and State governments to install speed breakers on the expressway to avert further loss of lives.

The institution’s Public Relations Officer, Dalington Oparaocha, confirmed the incident. He said the students’ demands were being looked into by the appropriate authorities.

“Yes, there was an accident on Sunday. And three students lost their lives. The protesting students, in solidarity with their departed colleagues, had barricaded the road to demand speed breakers, “ Oparaocha said.
