The Chancellor of Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Dr David Oyedepo, has advised new students of the university to shun examination malpractice and other evil acts that may lead to their expulsion from the school.

Speaking during the 18th matriculation of the university held recently, Oyedepo warned the students that the institution had zero-tolerance for all forms of examination malpractice and anyone caught would be rusticated.

He added, “Covenant University exists to raise a new generation of leaders through a qualitative training system that focuses on values and skills development. As we say here at Covenant, ‘until one is transformed, he cannot reform his environment his society or nation.’

“This is why we focus on equipping the persons of our students, so that they can continue to generate impact in their various vocations in life and that without prejudice to the pursuit of academic excellence.”

The chancellor urged the matriculating students to be diligent, make sacrifices and take their studies seriously.

The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof Adeyemi Atayero, said the institution was established to equip students with the spiritual, mental and physical capacity to impact their world positively.

Atayero added that the university’s mission was to redeem the battered image of the black man through capacity building, sacrifice and integrity.

About 1,860 students comprising 1,672 undergraduates and 188 postgraduates were matriculated for the 2019/2020 academic session.
