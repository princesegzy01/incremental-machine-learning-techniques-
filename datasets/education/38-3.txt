Computer rejects some JAMB candidates in Anambra
No fewer than 10 candidates for the ongoing Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination in Anambra State failed to participate in the examination due to failure of the computer to confirm their thumbprint.

The News Agency of Nigeria correspondent, who monitored the UTME in Awka on Friday, reports that the affected candidates for the examination were walked out of the hall because the computers could not confirm them as candidates.

Some of the candidates who spoke to NAN expressed shock that the computers rejected them after printing out their details.

Miss Chiamaka Okoro said she registered for the UTME with a centre at Basilica of the Holy Trinity centre at Onitsha but was asked to leave the hall when the computer could not confirm her candidacy for the exam.
