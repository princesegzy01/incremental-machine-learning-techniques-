No fewer than 80,000 pupils sat for the 2018 National Common Entrance Examination on Saturday in their bid to gain admission into the 104 Federal Government Colleges (Unity schools) for the 2018/2019 academic session.

Our correspondent learnt that Lagos State alone had 31 per cent of the pupils with about 25,000 candidates, who took the exam in the state on Saturday.

The Registrar of the National Examinations Council, Prof. Charles Uwakwe, said the examination also held in the North-East states, noting that reports obtained so far showed it went smoothly across all states.

Uwakwe noted that the council officials had left “since Wednesday” to the volatile states to ensure adequate preparation for the exercise.

He confirmed that Lagos State had the highest number of registered candidates, while Zamfara had the lowest with less than 50 pupils.

Uwakwe said, “The significant increase in the number of candidates that enrolled for this examination was at the insistence of the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, (who noted) that we should keep open doors to allow more candidates register for the examination.

“So, the registration went on till Friday when another 150 enrolled from one of the South-East states. The Federal Ministry of Education will determine the number of the candidates to be admitted based on the capacity of the schools.”
