James Abraham, Jos

The Vice-Chancellor of the Plateau State University, Prof Yohanna Izam, has described Sunday night’s attack on the institution by unknown gunmen as shocking.

The attack, which took place at the institution’s female hotels in Bokkos Council area, left a 100 level student of the Department of Geography dead from gunshot wounds.

The vice-chancellor, in a statement signed by the university’s spokesman, Mr John Agam and made available to our correspondent on Monday, expressed regret over the demise of the student, whom it described as a promising young man, particularly after a successful matriculation event held on the main campus of the university last Friday.

The statement read in part, “The Vice-Chancellor, on behalf of the university community, particularly the management of the institution, is deeply touched by this act of man’s inhumanity to man. He sincerely extends the deepest sympathy of the management to the parents of the deceased and the entire university community over this shocking development.”

The statement further appealed for calm and cooperation, especially among the students of the institution. “The University’s Campus Security Committee, in collaboration with the Special Task Force, has since swung into action to review the situation with a view to identify the perpetrators of the crime so that this ugly occurrence can be permanently nipped in the bud,” it said.
