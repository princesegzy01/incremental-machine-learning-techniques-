Femi Makinde

The alumni association of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso, Oyo State, has inaugurated a scholarship board to assist indigent undergraduates of the institution.

According to a statement made available to our correspondent on Monday by the Public Relations Officer of the association, Mr Damilare Adeyemi, the National President of the association, Mr Solomon Onilede, said this at the 12th annual lecture of the alumni association titled ‘State Universities and Funding: The Intrigues.’

Onilede said the scholarship would be financed from the funds donated by some private individuals and would not be taken from the account of the association.

The president also urged LAUTECH undergraduates who were having problem financing their education to approach the committee set up for the purpose.

He said, “The beneficiaries of this scholarship are going to be strictly indigent students who are on the verge of dropping out due to their over-concentration on work at the expense of their studies.”
