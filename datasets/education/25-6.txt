‘Skill acquisition, problem-solving latest trends in learning’
The Headteacher, Scholars’ Crest International School, Omole Phase 2, Lagos, Ms Gladys Allu, has said a more effective way in achieving lasting knowledge is for children to use problem-solving skills to acquire knowledge and solution in their community.

Allu said this at the open house Project-Based Learning presentation of the school held last Friday in Lagos.

She said, “It is no longer a big deal for children to pass with flying colours at the end of their education. Making a first class is just not enough nowadays. There is the need for pupils to develop skills and ideas for problem-solving.”

Allu added that the event was organised as a response to the latest practice in early childhood education which emphasised critical thinking, collaboration, risk-taking and reflective analysis in the process of learning.
