High fees discouraging teachers from training – Greensprings
The Greensprings Montessori College has urged training institutions in Nigeria to subsidise and make teachers’ training affordable.

The Head of the institution’s training college, Mr. Abraham Ogunkambi, made the appeal during a workshop organised for teachers and educational administrators in Lagos.

At the workshop, participants were trained in etiquette and comportment, Mathematics curriculum, thinking skills and practical life exercises, among other subjects.

Ogunkambi noted that Nigeria’s poor economic situation was affecting teachers’ ability to attend trainings. This, he said, could be resolved if training institutions reduced training fee for teachers.

He said, “The Montessori method rests on certain principles that include the Montessori-prepared environment, the sensitive period and absorbent mind of the child, intrinsic motivation, freedom without licence, etc. Today, the method is growing in different countries of the world.

“Here in Nigeria, there is a need for proper education of teachers. We need to make teachers training affordable because the economy is bad and many of them may not have the resources. That is what we have been doing here.”

The representative of the Executive Director of Greensprings, Ms. Dolapo Fatoki, explained that the benefits of Montessori style of teaching outshined its cost.

“What you gain from learning and using this method (Montessori) is more than the cost. You can also improvise with local materials to reduce cost,” she added.

One of the participants, Onye Eje, encouraged teachers not to relent in acquiring knowledge.

“Learning is the bedrock of life. I encourage colleagues worldwide to continue to retrain themselves,” she added.
