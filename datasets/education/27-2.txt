Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Old Boys of Saint Charles Grammar School, Osogbo, Osun State, has called for the return of their school to the Catholic Mission, which established the school.

The National President of the alumni association of the school, Charlean Rotimi Aluko, at a press conference held as part of events to mark the 59th Founder’s Day, said there was urgent need to reposition the school in line with the dreams of the founding fathers.

Aluko said, “Quality education is a combination of many things and not just erecting or renovating structures; it includes the provision of good learning ambience which many of our stanzas have been doing.

“We are meeting with the relevant stakeholders to help come up with strategies that can help improve the standard of education in the school.

“During our time, the school was known for academic excellence but now the standard has fallen. We want to know what the problems are. We will try whatever we can to make sure the school move from its current state of zero performance to 100 per cent.

He expressed optimism that the meeting with principals, teachers and parents would yield fruitful results.

According to him, the alumni association will also be meeting Governor Gboyega Oyetola soon, saying the return of the school to the Catholic Mission will be one of the demands that will be tabled before the governor.
