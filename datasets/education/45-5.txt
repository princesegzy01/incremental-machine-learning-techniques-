A Music teacher at Greensprings School, Lekki, Lagos, Mr Grant Maclean, has said that a combination of communication, music and dramatic art skills are critical in developing confident pupils.

He said this during a visit by the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art to the school to examine 111 pupils who sat for the academy’s examination.

Speaking on the essence of the academy’s certification to the pupils, Maclean said, “LAMDA improves a child’s communication and acting skills, thereby making the child more confident in his or her approach to life, as well as developing the ability to speak eloquently when engaging in conversations with other people. In a nutshell, it is excellent at instilling the right foundation of learning to the child’s education.”

On the pupils’ performance, the examiner, Ms Joanna Foster, said, “The pupils are very polite and have done very well in the examination. As pupils taking the LAMDA examination, they can build-up on their Universities and Colleges Admissions Service points which enables them to gain admission easily into the United Kingdom universities.”
