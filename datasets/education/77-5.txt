Polytechnic may offer scholarship to indigent persons
The Lagos Aviation Maritime Business Academy has said that it will offer scholarships to orphans, less-privileged and internally displaced persons in Nigeria in its 2018/2019 academic session, as part of its corporate social responsibility.

According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the Rector of LAMB, Dr Emeka Udowu, disclosed that 360 spaces had been made available at its main campus in the Ijegun area of Lagos for admission into the institution.

“LAMB, which is popularly known as Innovation Polytechnic, is an institution with focus on maritime and aviation. As part of our corporate social responsibility we want to assist the less privileged all over Nigeria as our capacity will allow.

“We have made provision to admit 360 indigent persons from all over the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory at a ratio of 10 students per state. I want to particularly urge students from the Northeast and North Central to key into this package,’’ Udowu said.

The rector added that as part of the package, the institution would waive 50 per cent of its tuition for the beneficiaries, allow a free three-month certificate programme and also award a National Innovation Diploma.

The rector also said the institution was channelling this offer through religious institutions.

Udowu called on governments at the federal and state levels to key into the package by granting an education support loan to institutions willing to help the indigent.
