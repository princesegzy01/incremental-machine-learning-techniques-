Mohammed orders construction of classrooms
Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi

The Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has directed the State Universal Basic Education Board to immediately embark on massive construction of classrooms across the state.

Mohammed gave the directive following an unscheduled visit to a school in Nasarawa Village in the Alkaleri Local Government Area where he met over 300 pupils studying under trees.

The governor expressed concern about the condition of public schools in the state, as he stated that the directive became necessary to ensure the provision of quality education to pupils.

“The inadequate public schools and infrastructure deficit across the state are part of the reasons the state is ranked highest in the number of out-of-school children in the country.”

Mohammed also appealed to donor agencies to support his administration’s determination towards boosting education in the state.
