Buhari orders national summit to tackle education funding
Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, to convene a national summit that will tackle the issues of inadequate funding in the sector.

This directive was disclosed in a release by the ministry’s Spokesperson, Willie Bassey, on Monday to announce the opening of the 63rd National Council on Education in Abuja.

The release quoted the President as saying education must be well funded as it was a tool for sustainable development.

Buhari therefore directed the ministry to convene a national summit to explore different funding models for education.

The Permanent Secretary, Sonny Echono, at the NCE opening, stated that the three tiers of government, federal, state and local governments, would be mobilised to support the funding of education in the country.

Echono said the directive of the President would form the discussion at the meeting during the week.

The release partly reads, “President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the Minister of Education to urgently convene a summit on education to address the issue of funding in the country.

“President Buhari said education was a tool for national development and its funding was essential for sustainable development. He has therefore directed the ministry to convene a national summit to explore different funding models for education.

“The 63rd National Council on Education will hold in Abuja from Monday to Thursday.”
