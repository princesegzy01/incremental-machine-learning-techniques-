Peter Dada, Akure

Members of the Old Students Association of Uso Community Grammar School, Uso in Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State have appealed to the state government to save the school from imminent collapse.

The former pupils lamented the deplorable condition of the school and urged the state government to ensure its quick rehabilitation.

Speaking during the first annual general meeting of the association, the chairman, Chief Adedayo Adejuwon, said that most of the existing structures in the school were in dire need of repairs.

He appealed to the state government to come to the school’s aid by providing good infrastructural facilities.

In her welcome address, the Principal of the school, Mrs Oluyinka Bayode, urged the former pupils to be alive to their responsibilities.

She said, “The government emphasised the need to depend on old pupils’ assistance. That is the reason why we have not stopped calling on you all the time. We wish to use this medium to appreciate all the former pupils of the school who have been responding to its call for support at all times.”
