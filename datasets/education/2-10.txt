Adamawa students meet gov over unpaid scholarships
Hindi Livinus, Yola

Representatives of the National Union of Adamawa State Students, drawn from various tertiary institutions across the country, have met with Governor Ahmadu Fintiri to appeal the payment of scholarship awards last paid seven years ago to undergraduates of Adamawa origin studying.

National President of the union, Gaddafi Hussaini, led other student union groups to the meeting.

Fintiri, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Crowther Seth, at the meeting after a solidarity march organised by the students to express their appreciation over the administration’s pledge to resume bursary awards before the end of the year.

Hussaini said the union organised the solidarity march to thank the state government for its decision to sponsor 60 indigent Adamawa students overseas to study Medicine and Engineering.

He said, “In the last seven years, we never heard that poor students could be sent overseas to study under any form of scholarship. But now many students have purchased forms through the Scholarship Trust Fund to study abroad.

“As students, we were being treated as second class citizens until your emergence. That was when Adamawa students understood they are indigenes of this state. All the students here are living witnesses to the fact that not one student here has ever received bursary awards from the state government since 2012.”
