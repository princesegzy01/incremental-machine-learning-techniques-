A Pan-African digital payment company, Interswitch, last Thursday, launched its InterswitchSPAK Volunteer Drive in Ajuwon High School, Ajuwon and Community High School, Ojodu-Abiodun, Ogun State, as part of the company’s ongoing InterswitchSPAK 1.0 competition, which promotes the study of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics education among pupils.

The activity, which featured members of the staff of Interswitch teaching science subjects in select public secondary schools, was aimed at promoting STEM education and encouraging a culture of volunteerism among the members of staff.

At the event, the CSR and Events and Sponsorship Specialist, Interswitch Group, Emuobosa Akpene, said the volunteer drive was created to compliment the InterswitchSPAK initiative, “As it avails us the opportunity to further promote the learning and adoption of STEM education by engaging with many more pupils that may necessarily not be engaged directly with the InterswitchSPAK quiz competition.”

A volunteer, Oremeyi Akah, who is the Chief Core Operations Officer of Interswitch, said the opportunity to inspire young people to better engage with and continue to study STEM subjects, as well as explore STEM careers, was the motivation behind her participation.

She encouraged the pupils to adopt STEM education and its application, stating that its relevance in the real world could not be overemphasised.
