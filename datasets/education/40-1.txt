‘School sports key to comprehensive child development’
Tare Youdeowei

The Proprietress of Brains Premier School, Mrs Ezinne Onoh, has said for every child to be well-rounded, sports have to be part of their education.

Onoh stated this on Saturday during the maiden inter-house sports competition held on the school premises in Amuwo Odofin, Lagos.

She said, “When a child is athletic, he or she will have a sound mind and body. This helps in every area of their lives, including academics. It also important because this is where you get talents and give them necessary training for opportunities in sports.”

Onoh, a former athlete, also bemoaned the inadequate support some pupils get from school authorities when they participate in sports.

“The pupils who are interested in sports should be supported. They should be made to know that they won’t be penalised if maybe, for example, in the process of representing the school, their academics take a hit. Because it will be discouraging if the school does not take care of them while they labour for the school.”

The Chairman on the occasion, Mr Lawrence Nwogoh, stressed the need for sports in schools.

He called on the government and the private sector to intensify their efforts in promoting school sports, saying it was an important means of boosting child development.
