Peter Dada, Akure

The old pupils of Owo High School, Owo, Ondo State, acting under the aegis of the Old Studentsâ€™ Association of Owo High School, have called on the Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to rehabilitate public schools in the state.

The Chairman of the association, Cannon Bayode Oladimeji, made this call during the inauguration of an ultra-modern digital resource centre, donated by a member of the association, Mr. Foluso Falaye, last Thursday.

Oladimeji, who explained that the association had contributed in no small measure to the development of the secondary school, urged Akeredolu to do more for the school in the area of infrastructural development.

He also called on other members of the association to emulate Falaye by donating to the development of the school.

In his remarks, Falaye lamented the deplorable condition of public schools in the state, which requires the urgent attention of the government and other stakeholders in the education sector.
