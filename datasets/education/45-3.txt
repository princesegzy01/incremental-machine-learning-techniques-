De-emphasise social media, administrator tells students
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Sole administrator of the College of Health, Science and Technology, IjeroEkiti, Mrs FolakemiFalore, has urged students of the institution to be focused and determined in their areas of specialisation.

Falore also told the students to de-emphasise social media and use their time for productive ventures in their studies.

The sole administrator, who spoke on Thursday during the institution’s eighth matriculation ceremony, encouraged the students to shun cultism and other anti social behaviour.

“Dwell less on social media platforms and always abide by the college’s rules and regulations. You must learn, not only academically, but also socially. The school must go through you, even as you go through the school, so that at graduation, you will be polished socially, mentally, morally and academically to go into the larger society.”

Falore further advised the students on professionalism as she disclosed that only 894 of the 1,116 candidates that applied for admission to the school were eventually admitted. “As prospective health practitioners who would be dealing with the health and lives of people, the highest standard of professionalism is expected of you both in studies and practice later in life.”
