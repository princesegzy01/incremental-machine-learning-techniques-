MAUTECH gets new VC
Hindi Livinus, Yola

The Governing Council of the Modibbo Adama University of Technology in Yola, Adamawa State, has approved the appointment of Abdullahi Tukur, a Professor of Environmental and Resources Planning, as the new Vice-Chancellor of the institution.

Tukur will take over from Prof. Mohammed Kyari, whose tenure expires on June 9.

The selection of the new VC had run into a stalemate following a tie between professors Abdullahi Tukur and Ibrahim Umar, who is the Rector of Adamawa State Polytechnic.

Despite the selection of Tukur as the new VC, the university awaits confirmation from the National Universities Commission, a security clearance and the go-ahead from the Federal Character Commission for the new appointment to become effective.

Tukur was born on April 8, 1961 in Kilbawo-Jada, Adamawa State and obtained his Bachelor of Science degree in Geography from Bayero University, Kano, in 1984. He bagged his masterâ€™s degree in Resources and Development from the University of Maiduguri in 1989, and PhD in Environmental and Resources Planning in 1997 from the University of Jos.
