The Rector of the Federal Polytechnic Ukana in Akwa Ibom State, Dr Uduak Ukekpe, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the amended Federal Polytechnic Act into law.

The rector hailed the President on Monday while hosting the Iban Nto Udo Umoh, a women’s group from the host community.

He said the new Polytechnic Act would help the polytechnic system to function optimally, reinvent the sector, reduce cost as well as give legal backing especially to the newly established polytechnics in the country.

Ukekpe informed the women group of the readiness of his administration to give the institution a new lease of life through the accreditation of more programmes, closer collaboration with the host communities, among other programmes and projects.

The rector also called for continuous support, prayers and encouragement of the women towards the growth and development of the Federal Polytechnic, Ukana, as he assured the women that the right machinery had been put in place and the community would begin to feel the impact of the polytechnic.

The President of the group, Mrs Dorcas Udofia, congratulated the rector and members of staff on their appointments, as she charged them to work hard to place the institution in a good light.

Udofia pledged the women’s support to the polytechnic in view of the lofty potential it holds for the community and the state.
