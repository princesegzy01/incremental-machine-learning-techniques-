Donâ€™t delay school projects, Delta commissioner warns contractors
Delta State Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, Chief Patrick Ukah, has warned contractors that the state government will not tolerate unnecessary delay in the handling of school projects.

The commissioner gave this warning at Emore Grammar School, Oleh in Isoko South Local Government Area, when he led officials of the ministry to inspect a block of 24 class rooms, laboratories and offices, among others, built by the state government.

After inspecting over 100 pupils in each classroom in the school, Chief Ukah expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of work on the new project, adding that after three visits to the school, no significant progress have been made by the contractor.

He instructed relevant officials of the ministry to assess the extent of the work done to enable the state government take a decision on the project.

The commissioner promised to do everything possible to ensure that outstanding work on the project is concluded within a few weeks so that the students can continue with their academic activities in a very conducive environment.

Chief Ukah warned other contractors handling school projects in the state to strictly abide by the terms of their contracts or risk the revocation of such contracts.

The commissioner said the state government would not treat defaulting contractors with kid gloves, stressing that henceforth, punitive action will be taken against such contractors.
