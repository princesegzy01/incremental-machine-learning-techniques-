Chima Azubuike, Gombe

The Gombe State College of Education in Billiri has secured the 2019 zonal intervention of N461.9m from the Tertiary Education Trust Fund for infrastructural development of the college.

This was disclosed by the Provost of the college, Dr Langa Banguji, during an interaction with newsmen in his office on Friday.

He disclosed that the college, which was established by the state government in 2012 and commenced educational activities in 2015, had been getting better in terms of quality of service delivery.

“The team of management staff has decided to make some sacrifices to make sure we lay a solid foundation for the development of the school. None of us has official vehicles, we put the college first before any other thing,” Banguji said.

The provost also revealed that the college was still suffering from various challenges, including lack of perimeter fencing for the school, lack of student hostels, shortage of senior academic staff and staff accommodation offices as well as erosion problem which is now a threat to some parts of the school land.
