Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, has proposed the sum of N1 billion for the provision of security and perimeter fencing for the two campuses of the institution at Oye-Ekiti and Ikole-Ekiti.

The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof Kayode Soremekun, in a pre-convocation briefing held on the main campus at Oye-Ekiti on Monday, said the arrangement was aimed at securing the lives of the students and staff, as well as property belonging to the institution.

He said, “We are very concerned about the security of our staff and students. A billion naira has been estimated to fence the Oye and Ikole campuses. We are experiencing occasional cases of encroachment on our lands and to prevent this, we have to fence our campuses.

“Our dream is to transform FUOYE into a world class university, producing graduates with enviable academic credentials, who can hold their own anywhere they find themselves across the globe.

“We aspire to be competitive in all metrics nationally and globally and ultimately produce sound graduates, majority of who will be wealth creators and employers of labour and not only mere job seekers.”

While giving account of his stewardship in the last three years, the vice-chancellor said, “I met 29 operational programmes when I came in February, 2016. Today, we have 60 programmes. We have also added the Faculties of Education and Management Sciences to expand the scope”.

Soremekun also disclosed that about 1,000 graduands would be awarded first degrees, with 35 of them bagging first class.
