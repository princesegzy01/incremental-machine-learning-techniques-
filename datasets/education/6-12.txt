Bowen University Radio marks 2nd anniversary
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

Bowen Radio, a broadcast station owned by Bowen University, Iwo in Osun State, recently marked the second anniversary of its establishment, by calling on stakeholders to work towards a well-managed communication system that will enhance security.

Speaking during the event, a former Executive Director of Tell Magazine, Mr Dare Babarinsa, described the modern media as a veritable institution, but he warned practitioners to be mindful of the contents being released to the public in order not to fuel insecurity.

Recalling how an exaggerated news report ignited violent protests in different parts of Kaduna State in 1987, he said that journalists could either help to halt or compound security challenges facing the country through their reports.

Also, a former Nigerian Ambassador to the Philippines, Dr. Yemi Farounbi, in his goodwill message said the only way Nigeria could curtail the prevalent insecurity was by giving attention to the provision of jobs, food and economy insecurity.

He said, â€œGiven the problems associated with national security and insecurity, and the problems created by the insurgency in the North-East, invaders in the North-West, the militancy by Niger Delta militants in South-South , the problems from IPOB and MASSOB in the South-East and the rampaging herdsmen in the South-West, national security became imperative.
