The Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Save Our Needy Organisation, Marvella Odili, has emerged the first Nigerian to receive the French International Prize which promotes women entrepreneurship, leadership and technology in developing countries.

The award was presented last Thursday by a former President of France, François Hollande, who is also the President of Fondation La France S’engage, during the award ceremony in Paris, France.

Odili, in an interview with our correspondent, said the prize was for her project, tagged ‘Connecting marginalised women to technology and development’, implemented in Lagos, Ibadan and Delta states and aimed at bringing an end to extreme poverty through the education and economic empowerment of women.

She also said the project had trained up to 600 women, comprising unemployed graduates, teenage mothers, young widows and other marginalised women between the ages of 18 and 40, in Information Communication Technology, as well as entrepreneurship.

“We started with 200 women in the free eight weeks intensive training. We do a follow-up; monitoring and evaluation. This award will expand my project. Previously it was implemented in Lagos, Ibadan and Delta states. With this award, I will be able to expand to the North and other geopolitical zones. This project will contribute to improving the lives of marginalised women economically and more. We also hope to have our own training centres in order to increase our capacity to provide more women with the tools to start,” she said.

Odili was selected as one of the five winners who came from Madagascar, Afghanistan, Togo and Burkina Faso.
