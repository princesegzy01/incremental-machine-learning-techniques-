KolaDaisi varsity subsidises fees for indigent students
KolaDaisi University, Ibadan, has unveiled a special subsidy package spreading across all its undergraduate degree programmes.

The development, according to the university’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Kolade Ayorinde, is a management decision, influenced by the founder of the institution, Chief Kola Daisi, to make education available to Nigerian youths and to ensure affordability without compromising standards.

Ayorinde stated that the founder, in furtherance of his educational endowment programmes, had agreed to subsidise all fees and levies payable by each undergraduate of the university to the tune of a minimum of N50,000, stressing that the subsidy would be solely funded by the founder of the institution.

The VC added, “The subsidy scheme is scheduled to take effect from the 2018/2019 academic session. It will not only be enjoyed by our fresh students, it will also accommodate the returning students.”

He further disclosed that the university management would equally offer a 2.5 per cent discount to the first 100 students to complete their registration, while students who paid their fees once would enjoy an extra five per cent discount.

Reacting to the development, the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman, Governing Council of the University, Prof. Adeniyi Osuntogun, applauded Daisi, noting that the gesture was expedient, considering the current economic reality in the country, along with attendant consequences on educational attainment and quality manpower.
