Speaking to Ekourba Gyasi on Atinka AM Drive Monday, Agnes Teye Cudjoe explained that although 2018 WASSCE saw an increase in the passes in Science compared to 2018, there was a total drop in passes in English and Maths.

She added that the 2018 Chief Examiners Report informed WAEC of a lack of vocabulary in the scripts of most of the candidates.

The 2018 Chief Examiners Report has recommended extensive reading for the students to help students build their vocabulary.

“You would agree with me that these days, our candidates hardly read, everybody is busy doing WhatsApp and all that. If students spend more time reading very good books, textbooks, Literature and English books they will improve and have command of the English Language.

According to MadamTeye Cudjoe, the report also urged teachers to give students more exercises on spelling drills, comprehension and summary to help students improve their Vocabulary.

“With respect to Mathematics, the 2018 Chief Examiners report revealed that the major challenge for the candidates was as a result of their inability to translate story problems into mathematical statements. The report also discovered that the candidates failed to answer questions on trigonometry and geometry”, she added.
