Kiddies Vision Magazine produced young ministers and commissioners at the recently concluded Young Ministers Competition Grand Finale, in Lagos.

Held in collaboration with HUAXING Arts Troupe Nigeria, the organisers stated that the competition, in its fifth season, was established to test pupils on how well they knew the country.

They also said the competition served to enlighten them on the functions, organs and government activities, as well as guide them towards societal values and good governance.

Stating that the competition was to nurture excellent leadership, Director, Kiddies Vision Magazine, Ms. Nnena Umeohia, said, “The competition came into being when we realised that Nigerian students know practically nothing about their country, whereas they are quite familiar with foreign movies, cartoons, soccer, actors and so on. So, the purpose of this competition is to nurture them on excellent leadership, as well as set innovative ways of educating Nigerians through the media.”

The competition, which was a 32-week television show, focused on the ministries of education, health, finance, youths and sports, tourism and arts and culture.

Also speaking at the event was the Chief Executive Officer, Seven Stars Tissue Paper, Eric Ni, who noted, “I have been involved in this project since inception and with the support of my Chinese community we shall continue to train and support the younger ones because they are the leaders of tomorrow. A scholarship fund of N20,000 was given to 100 students to show our commitment.”

Prizes ranged from N100,000 to N30,000 for each of the 10 winners per category.
