‘States must return schools to owners’
Dayo Ojerinde

the Old Students’ Association of United Christian Secondary School, Apapa, Lagos, has urged state governments to return mission schools to the original owners so as to ensure the provision of quality education.

The President of the association, Mr Tony Iyare, made the call in Lagos at a briefing organised by the association to mark the 60th anniversary of the school.

He said, “The decision of various state governments to take over mission schools in the country has not yielded positive results. Instead, it has put those schools in a bad shape. There is no alternative to returning the schools to their original owners because they will commit a lot of resources to running them and making them sustainable.

“The original owners will be able to take better care of the schools than the government who are far removed from the management of the schools. The government can focus on other things and leave the running of the schools to their establishers. These pupils are the future of Nigeria and it is only sound education that can guide them.”

Iyare also lamented the falling standard of education in the country, he added, “If you go round the United Christian Secondary School, Apapa, it is riddled with broken windows, desks, doors, ripped whiteboards and dilapidated buildings. For those who attended the old school with its beautiful flowers and impeccably cut grasses and with learning conducted under some of the best atmosphere, they simply weep each time they are here.”
