Etim Ekpimah, Uyo

A professor of Food and Industrial Microbiology at the University of Uyo, Comfort Inyang, has called on the Federal Government to increase the funding of bio-technological researches in the country.

According to Inyang, increased funding in this respect will arrest the wasting of great potential in the academia.

She also said the nation’s economy would be strengthened if Nigeria focused seriously on the emerging opportunities micro-organisms offered.

Speaking during the 62nd inaugural lecture of the university held in Uyo, the state capital, on Monday, Inyang argued that without microbes, humans would not be able to carry out their daily activities.

Explaining that not all micro-organisms were bad, she noted that some aided food digestion.

Inyang said that microbes were everywhere and, without them, there would be negative effects on both humans and the environment.

She added that microbes played a very vital role in medicine, food safety, industrial production, the environment, oil and energy industry, and they held great promise in the area of nanotechnology.

“The Federal Government should increase funding of bio-technological researches in order not to bury great potential in the academia. Nigeria should seriously target emerging opportunities microbes have to offer. It will go a long way in strengthening our economy and empowering us.

“Microbes play a very vital role in medicine; micro-organisms are medically indispensable. They are used for the production of antibiotics and vaccines. Microbes have provided many industrial products that have profoundly changed our lives.”
