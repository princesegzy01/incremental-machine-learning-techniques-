Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board said on Sunday that a native of Biu in Borno State, Israel Zakari, got the highest score in the 2018 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.

According to the board, Zakari, who sat for the UTME in Ogun State, scored 364 out of a possible 400 marks in the examination, beating Adekunle Jesufemi and Alikah Oseghale, both of who scored 358 and 357, respectively, to the second and third positions.

Jesufemi and Oseghale are natives of Ogun and Edo states, respectively.

Our correspondent gathered that apart from the top three candidates, Ademola Adetola, who hails from Ogun State and sat for the examination in Lagos State, came fourth with 355.

Meanwhile, the fifth position was shared among three candidates who got 354; Akinyemi Paul from Ogun State, who took his examination in Lagos; Terhemba Moses from Benue State, who took the examination in Makurdi; and Obi-Obuoha Abiamamela from River State, who sat for the examination in Port Harcourt.

The JAMB Head of Public Affairs, Dr Fabian Benjamin, who confirmed this in a release on Sunday, said the board appealed to individuals and organisations desiring to use the UTME data for research and national statistics to seek accurate information from the agency and avoid misleading sources.

Benjamin said, “This release of candidates’ scores is imperative to ensure that the public is not misled by unverified reports.

“Israel Galadima from Borno State came first with 364 score while Adekunle Jesufemi from Ogun State scored 358; third position is Alikah Oseghale from Edo State who sat for the examination in Ekpoma and score 357.”
