The Lagos State Government, through the Lagos State Examinations Board, is set to release the 2018 Basic Education Certificate Examination Result.

The was made known by the Director of the board, Mr Oluwafemi Hassan, during the 2018 Award Meeting which had the chief examiners of the 10 subjects, directors of schools administration, subject teachers, representatives from the Ministry of Education and President of All Nigerian Conference of Principals of Secondary Schools, in attendance.

Hassan noted that the essence of the award meeting was to set a standard for the grading the 10 subjects.

He said, “The yardstick for promoting the students to senior secondary school must be the true reflection of their performance. To this end, it was resolved that for a student to move to the next class, he or she must have six credits including English Studies and Mathematics. It is of note that the students who failed the compulsory subjects would have to re-sit before they can be promoted.

“All this is because education is key to the development and growth of the state. Therefore, all hands must be on deck to take the education sector to greater heights,” Hassan stated.
