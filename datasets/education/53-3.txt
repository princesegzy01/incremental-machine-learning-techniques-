Tunde Oyekola, Kwara

The Vice-Chancellor of Al-Hikmah University, Ilorin, Prof. Taofeek Ibrahim, has advised the 503 new students of the institution to avoid gangs and social vices if they intend to graduate successfully from the university.

Ibrahim gave the advice during the 14th matriculation of students for the 2018/2019 academic session held at the university’s auditorium on Friday.

Stressing that the institution maintained zero tolerance of academic corruption, dishonesty, laziness and distrust, he warned the students that vices could lead to their rustication or expulsion from the university.

The VC said, “I charge you to be very serious with your studies. Be morally upright and avoid gangs of unserious students, drug abuse, sexual misbehaviour, fighting, examination malpractice and other vices that may lead to your rustication or expulsion from the university.”

He advised the students to work hard to achieve success as they are the future leaders of the country.

“This is the beginning of your struggle to achieve greater success. Your success cannot but come with hard work and commitment to your studies. You must be ready to devote more of your time to your study, otherwise, you will end up graduating in whatever you have devoted your time to, other than your studies. Be conscious of the university’s rules contained in the university handbook and be guided by them,” the VC said.
