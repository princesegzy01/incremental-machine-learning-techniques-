Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

A public primary school pupil, Ruwo Wodi, of Science Primary School in Kwali, Abuja, has emerged the winner of the Korea-Nigeria Drawing Competition.

Wodi was one of 150 primary school pupils who participated in the 10th edition of the competition organised by the Korean Cultural Centre of Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory Universal Basic Education Board.

About 35 public and private primary schools in the FCT participated in the competition, with the theme, “Freedom,’ where pupils were given cardboards and asked to draw paintings that reflected Nigerian and Korean traditions.

The KCCN Director, Mr Lee Jin-Su, said the competition was to drive innovation, friendship, relationship, as well as socio-economic and youth development of the country.

He said, “The drawing competition was organised for schools in the FCT. Between the two countries, it is for the development of skills for the pupils. Young children can grow up, develop friendship and interests in the arts and culture.”

The FCT UBEB Director, Dr Adamu Noma, who was represented by the Director of Public/Private Partnership, Habiba Barau, said, “We cannot underestimate the role of mutual understanding in the economic and social development of any country. This competition provides an opportunity for cultural integration and understanding which is part of international relations.”

Wodi went home with a laptop, while the second prize was won by Edache Damian of Smart Academy. The third prize was won by another public primary school pupil, Habila Jehoshaphat, of Local Education Authority Primary School, Peyi.
