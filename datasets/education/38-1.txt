NEPC trains over 250 bee farmers in Benue
John Charles, Makurdi

The Nigeria Export Promotion Council has trained over 250 bee farmers in Benue State in modern methods of beekeeping that will enhance the production of natural honey that can be exported to Europe.

The Zonal Controller in charge of Makurdi Zonal Office, Mr Anani Ben-Egon, while declaring the training open, said the lack of strict sanitary requirements that could guarantee the safety of honey for human health was responsible for the inability of Nigerian bee farmers to export the product to Europe.

He added that aside health and sanitary requirements restricting Nigeria honey export to the EU, inadequate production of honey in the country also accounted for low exportation.

Egon said, “The global honey trade is worth $240bn with China maintaining the lead as the world exporter with 11.3 per cent of global export of natural honey in 2017 worth $270.7m. The continuous engagement with product/industry associations, farmers’ groups and other relevant stakeholders will enhance the production of honey in the country that would be suitable for export to the EU market.”

The state coordinator, National Committee on Export Promotion and Benue Exporters Cluster, Dr Lawrence Barki, stated that there could be no better time than now to encourage bee farmers in Nigeria in line with the Federal Government diversification policy on the development of non-oil sector of the nation’s economy.
