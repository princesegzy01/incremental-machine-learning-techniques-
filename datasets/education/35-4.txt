Alumni renovate, stock school library
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The 1979/84 set of St. John’s Grammar School, Ile-Ife in Osun State has handed over a renovated library stocked with books to the school.

The handover ceremony, which held recently in the school’s premises, had the Lagos State Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Mr Kehinde Bamigbetan, as guest speaker.

In his address, Bamigbetan commended the set as he noted that the new library would assist pupils in their educational pursuit.

He said, “We can hardly function today without reading. To use mobile phones you have to be literate and with the increase in the development of gadgets and our voracious appetite for new versions, a social pressure to belong in the new civilization drives even dropouts and those who never went to school to learn. These things further make literacy important.

“Although reading for education begins with literacy it demands much more than a functional ability to read. First, it begins with the curious and inquisitive mind desiring to solve a problem or a puzzle.”

The Tutor-General for Osun East Senatorial District, Mr Adelani Aderinola, said the state was not opposed to any kind of support that could help in the development of education in the state, as the government needed contributions from old pupils and other stakeholders for better funding of the sector.

This was just as the coordinator of the set, Engr. Adewuyi Adetogun, said the gesture was to enhance teaching and learning in the school.
