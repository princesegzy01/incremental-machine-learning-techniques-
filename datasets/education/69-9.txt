Foundation seeks improved infrastructure in Imo schools
Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

A Non-Governmental Organisation, Dee-Yke Global Foundation, has urged the Imo State Government to improve the conditions of the infrastructure in primary and secondary schools in the state.

The Chief Executive Officer of the foundation, Ikechukwu Agoha, made the appeal while donating a block of classrooms to Obilibi- Mbieri Community Primary School in the Mbaitoli Local Government Area of the state.

Agoha said that the foundation’s desire to see pupils learn in an enabling environment had inspired the donation.

Decrying the condition of most of the primary and secondary schools visited by the foundation, he warned that a hostile academic environment was harmful to the educational development of pupils.

Agoha said he had decided to give back to the school, which helped to shaped his early academic life, because he was not impressed with what he saw when he last visited the premises.

He said, “I was not impressed with the state of the infrastructure of the school when I visited with my son. I expect this gesture to go a long way in improving the quality of education in this school.”

In her reaction, the Headmaster of the school, Mrs Joyce Njoku, said the new building would motivate the teachers and encourage them to raise quality leaders of tomorrow for the society.

Also, the Imo State Director of Universal Basic Education, Stella Ndu, noted that the government was in need of more individuals to partner with in terms of improving the quality of education in the state.
