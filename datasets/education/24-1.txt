The Chairman of the Lagos State branch of the University of Lagos Alumni Association, Dr Lukumon Adeoti, has called for the support of Nigerians towards the ‘Support Our University Projects’ initiative.

Adeoti said this on Thursday during a briefing in Lagos to announce the 7th Prof. Adetokunbo Babatunde Sofoluwe Memorial Lecture slated for Thursday, July 4.

He described the SOUP initiative as a life-saving project, as most students of the institution lacked basic financial capability.

“Our aim is to develop the university by developing the indigent students. Most of the students of the institution engage in activities that distract them from learning in their efforts to make ends meet. We are expecting that with this project we can help as many as possible,” he said.

Adeoti, however, lamented the paucity of funds to carry out the project as he disclosed that the association needed N708m to achieve it desired goal.

“However beautiful, we don’t have enough finances to carry out this project. We call on well-meaning Nigerians and alumni to come to the aid of indigent students of the institution to enable us to salvage the institution. Departmental offices will be contacted to enable us to pick the best students to benefit first in this project,” he said.

The chairman also gave the assurance that the project would soon extend to post-graduate students but finance was the association’s only limitation.
