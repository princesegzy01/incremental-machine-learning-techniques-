Scholarship beneficiary charges pupils to study hard
Dayo Ojerinde

A former pupil of Olowora Primary School in Isheri, Lagos, Blessing Ugbebor, has advised pupils in the school to take their studies seriously.

Eleven year-old Ugbebor, who was granted a scholarship to complete her six-year secondary school education at Mind Builders High School, Alausa, also in Lagos, addressed the current pupils at the school’s Assembly Hall recently. Recounting how she became a recipient of a scholarship award at the Mind Builders High School, she said, “During the 20th anniversary of the Mind Builders High School, I was asked to give the vote of thanks. As fate would have it, an invited guest, Mr Gbenga Badejo, identified me as somebody in need of assistance. He promised to take up responsibility for my six-year secondary school education, in collaboration with the Board of the Mind Builders High School, as long as I passed the school’s scholarship entrance examination.

“I was lucky to be among the five beneficiaries of the scholarship award. This is a dream that I never believed, even in my wildest imagination, could come true. I am very grateful to God for the all-round transformation that I have experienced in the past one year as a pupil of Mind Builders High school.”

She encouraged the current primary six pupils of Olowora Primary School that will qualify to sit for the entrance examination into Mind Builders High School later in the month to be serious in their studies.
