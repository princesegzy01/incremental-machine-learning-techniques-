More Edo pupils for feeding programme
Adekunle Peter, Benin

Pupils in primary four, five and six in public schools in rural parts of Edo State have been slated to benefit from the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme.

This is as over 60 primary schools in Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon local government areas of the state have been included in the social investment programme of the Federal Government.

The Edo State Programme Manager of NHGSFP, Dr Doris Ayanka-Imalele, said the state governor, Godwin Obaseki, recently gave the directive to extend the social investment programme, adding letters of posting to caterers would be released next week.

Ayanka-Imalele who spoke at an event where start-up kits were distributed to the caterers for the commencement of the programme in two local government areas of the state, urged the caterers to give their best services to the pupils.

Also, the state focal person of NHGSFP, Ms Osayuwamen Aladeshelu, disclosed that over 261 caterers had been engaged and would earn daily income from the programme.

“We have engaged over 261 caterers to feed the pupils and we hope this will encourage more pupils to come back to public schools. From Monday, over 60 schools will become beneficiaries of the programme in Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon LGAs.”

“The caterers have undergone training and test; they have been taught food hygiene, food handling, food portion and product management. We also have monitoring teams that will evaluate them to ensure that they comply with our standards,” she said.
