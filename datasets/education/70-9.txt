Itel mobile has donated educational materials and food items to the children of SOS village, Isolo, Lagos, as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility initiative.

The Marketing Manager, itel mobile, Mr Jeff Tang, said the CSR initiative was targeted at children, youths and adults who often do not have access to basic amenities, educational materials, and medical care.

“It is a bi-monthly and our focus is on primary school pupils because they are the future, they need to learn more. Next time, we will teach the kids about technology so that they can show interest in what is trending in the tech world,” Tang said.

The Programme director, SOS Village, Isolo, Lagos, Mr Ayodeji Adelope, said the educational materials and food items would go a long way to boost the morale of the underprivileged children.

“We are a social development organisation that provides care for the vulnerable children who don’t have a family. At different stages, their needs differ, but this educational materials will serve as an encouragement for them,” Adelopo said.

The Human Resource Manager, Iknobert Communications, Mr Bright Adetula, noted that when individuals and corporate bodies give back to the society by investing in the future of young children the country will reap from it.
