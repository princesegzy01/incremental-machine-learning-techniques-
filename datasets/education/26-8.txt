Ekiti vows to improve learning environment
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Ekiti State Commissioner for Education, Mr Foluso Daramola, on Wednesday, said the state government would do everything possible to make teaching and learning conducive for the staff and pupils of all public schools across the state.

Daramola gave the staff and pupils of St. Louis Grammar School, Ikere-Ekiti and Government Special School, Ido-Ekiti, the assurance that the government would assist in the renovation of their hostels and administrative buildings, which were recently destroyed during a rainstorm.

The commissioner, who spoke during his visit to the schools to assess the level of damage caused by the rainstorm, called on school administrators to plant trees that could serve as wind brakes to prevent future occurrences.

He said, “The relevant agency of the government has been notified and mobilised to move to site and commence the renovation immediately.”

The Principal of St. Louis Grammar School, Mrs Rhoda Ojo, appreciated the state government for the swift intervention.
