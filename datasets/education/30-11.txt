Adekunle Peter, Benin

Out of the 75, 000 candidates who applied for admission to the University of Benin for the 2018/2019 academic session, only 11,772 were offered provisional admission.

The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Faraday Orumwense, disclosed this during the institution’s matriculation event held on the main campus in Ugbowo, Benin City, last Saturday.

Orumwense said that as a result of the accreditation of more courses in the university, the National Universities Commission had expanded UNIBEN’s quota to accommodate more candidates.

While admonishing the matriculants to shun vices, including cultism and prostitution, the vice-chancellor urged them to make use of the facilities provided by the ivory tower.

He also charged the students to remain focused on their academic pursuit and shun examination malpractices, as well as strive for excellence.

At the event, the university’s Registrar, Dr Otasowie Oshodin, administered the matriculation oath on the new students.
