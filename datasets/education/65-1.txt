The Federal Polytechnic, Ile-Oluji, Ondo State has said that it is collaborating with some foreign universities to boost the academic excellence of students of the institution in the areas of innovation, technology and entrepreneurship.

The polytechnic, which was established in 2014 by the Federal Government, also said the deal would enable the polytechnic to produce innovative and creative graduates for technological advancement.

The Rector of the polytechnic, Prof. Emmanuel Fasakin, who disclosed this in a meeting with journalists in his office on Monday, said the collaboration would go a long way to enlarge the scope of the polytechnic locally and internationally.

He said, “We have entered into an agreement with Auburn University in Alabama, United States of America. They will assist the polytechnic tremendously in the area of agriculture. The Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, USA is ready to assist in terms of agricultural technology and engineering.

“We have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the University of Baton Rouge in Louisiana, USA. They are going to assist us supply e-library, e-learning and other modern equipment to improve the learning base of the students.

“The MOU between these great universities and our school is to create different kinds of hubs for young start-ups to develop their skills in different areas.”

“We have a collaboration with Soteria Global Solutions Limited, owned by an indigene of Ile Oluji. The organisation is building a 604-room capacity hostel for both male and female students of the polytechnic, a shopping mall and fuel depot.”
