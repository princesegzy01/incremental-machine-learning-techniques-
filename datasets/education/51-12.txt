Stay away from school, ASUU warns AAU students
Adekunle Peter, Benin

The Academic Staff Union of Universities, Ambrose Ali University, Ekpoma chapter, has warned students of the institution to stay away from the main campus of the institution as it is not in a hurry to pull out of the nationwide strike.

The chapter also asked parents to keep their children at home and not expose them to the unnecessary risks of traveling to the university.

This was made known in a statement signed by the Chairperson, ASUU- AAU, Dr Monday Igbafen, which said that plans by the university’s management to reopen the institution for academic activities would not work.

The statement reads in part, “We wish to notify the general public that we just closed from our congress this morning, January 21, 2019, and resolved to continue with the nationwide strike approved by our national body on November 4, 2018, which is also meant to revitalise public universities, including our own AAU, Ekpoma.

“For ASUU- AAU, Ekpoma, it is only the national leadership of the union that can call for the suspension of the strike. We are intact and in support of our national strike action. We wish to advise our dear parents and guardians that ASUU-AAU, Ekpoma, is fully on strike and therefore, should be guided on not risking the lives of our dear students by allowing them to travel unnecessarily because of a purported resumption of lectures.”

Igbafen said it would be counter-productive to reopen the university when members of the union would not be available to attend to the students or teach because of the ongoing strike. “The strike is total, indefinite and comprehensive,” he emphasised.
