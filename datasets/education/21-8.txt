The founder and Creative Director of I Create Club, Mrs Eniola Afolayan, has said that art competitions are essential for developing future leaders that can think outside the box.

She said this at the second I Create Club and Vitafoam Nigeria Plc’s Pillow Art Challenge held at the University of Lagos on Saturday, where 30 schools participated.

Afolayan, who noted that effective education should see to the all-round development of the child, said, “Creativity promotes imaginative thinking which enables children to attain their highest level of intellectual, social and emotional potential.

“Our competition is designed to spur children towards creativity. It is not just about fine art competition, rather, it embodies all aspects of human creativity, including the development of future leaders who can think outside the box.”

The Group Products Manager of Vitafoam, Mrs Rachel Ogolo, said that the company’s support for the competition was in line with its objective of defining people’s art of living by going to the basics and placing a premium on the young ones.

“At Vitafoam, our payoff is the fine art of living. We want to define people’s art of living. We felt that we needed to go back to the basics, getting the young ones to understand life and that requires being creative,” she said.
