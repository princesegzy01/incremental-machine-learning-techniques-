Winners of the Spelling Bee competition in Bayelsa State on Thursday received their scholarship funds from one of the major supporters of the annual event, the Robert Sunday Iworiso Foundation.

The winners, Master Ebifiye Okara, who came first in the primary category, and Master Ovuru Nadou, who secured the first position in the secondary category, were presented with a cheque of N200,000.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the Founder of the RSIF, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, in his remarks, said the competition had produced bright minds and also improved the academic life style of many pupils.

He gave the assurance that the foundation, which was established in memory of his late father, would continue to support the annual competition in order to identify talented young people and help shape their future.

While congratulating the winners, he said the scholarship was a modest way to appreciate those who were desirous of creating a better future for themselves through education.

Iworiso-Markson, who is the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, also called for more sponsors for the competition, stressing that education is paramount for the development of a society.

He said the Bayelsa State Government was passionate about the education of young people as they are the biggest assets in the state.

The programme lead of Creative Expression International, organisers of the event, Ebidenyefa Nikade, thanked Iworiso-Markson for his kind gesture and promised to make subsequent editions of the competition better.
