Old pupils of JHS demand increment of education budget
The Old Students Association of Jibowu High School has described the budget for education as extremely low.

The association made this known through its President, Mr Abiodun Ariyibi, while distributing education materials to pupils of the school.

Ariyibi, who implored the government to increase the financial plan allotted to learning, lamented that the quality of the teaching staff in the country and the rate at which pupils were being distracted by the social media, saying that these factors contributed to the decline in the education sector.

He said, “Private individuals should assist the government in running the education sector. The recurrent expenditure of running a school is huge. Government alone cannot do it that is why there is a need for private individuals to support the government.

“I implore the Federal Government to increase the budget on education. In Finland, if you graduate with a first class, you must teach and the teachers get attractive salaries.”
