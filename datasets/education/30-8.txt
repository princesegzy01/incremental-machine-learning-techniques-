The Pan Atlantic University has said that it is ready to produce industry-ready graduates that would deepen expertise in Nollywood through the Masters in Film Production programme.

The programme, which will be run by the School of Media and Communication of the university, is scheduled to commence in October 2019.

This was made known at a briefing held last Tuesday. At the event, the institution said it was seeking between 30 and 60 students in its bid to create a ‘new Nollywood of global standards’.

The Dean of the School of Media and Communication, Dr Ikechukwu Obiaya, said the course would cover Scripting and Directing for the Screen; Cinematography; Editing for the Screen; and Sound Design for the Screen.

“The course offers specialisation options in seven major film production areas like short film; documentary; interview and feature film. Others are serial drama, commercial film-let and the music video,” he disclosed.

Obiaya added that the school would run the programme on the back of its deep interest in the industry including its Nollywood Studies Centre with a stock of over 10, 000 films, and its ongoing collaboration with the industry serving as a curriculum guide for the DSTV Multichoice Talent Factory Academy.

He mentioned that students had the option of full or part time study, as the course, would cover five semesters or seven depending on the stream the student enters.
