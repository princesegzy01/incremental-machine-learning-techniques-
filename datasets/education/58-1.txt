The Chief Executive Officer, STEAM Empowerment Foundation, Mrs Olabisi Ozo-Onyali, has said that Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Crafts and Mathematics, a new curriculum which has been adapted to reflect the country’s cultural values, is key to building an advanced and technology-driven society.

Ozo-Onyali made this known at a press conference in Ikeja, Lagos on Wednesday, where she disclosed that the foundation’s STEAM club, an after-school club was in 50 schools in Lagos and Abuja, and was training at least 1,000 children.

She said, “STEM is well known for its global demand, however Nigeria is also known for its interest in arts and crafts because it promotes our cultural heritage. Therefore, STEAM Empowerment Foundation isn’t just interested in meeting global demands, it is also particular about our local needs. Our aim is to build and impart children in the African market space with concepts of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Crafts, and Mathematics using informal methods to ignite the passion for innovation in children from a tender age.

“We do this through interaction with concepts, skills, hands-on modelling of real-world devices and modern technologies which are pertinent to the world today. We want to prepare our children for the future workplace, make them competitive amongst their global contemporaries and develop Nigeria to become a first world country. We also want to raise children who become innovators and inventors by exposure to STEAM education, as well as ignite a passion and strengthen skills in STEAM in order to build an advanced and technology-driven society,” Ozo-Onyali said.
