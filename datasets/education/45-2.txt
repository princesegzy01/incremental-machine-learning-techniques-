ACE to partner artisans on skills acquisition
Peter Dada, Akure

The Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo, Ondo State has said that it will partner artisans on vocational skills acquisition for its students.

The institution also said it commenced entrepreneurial programmes that would equip the students to become self-reliant after graduating from the school.

The Provost of the college, Dr. Samuel Akintunde, stated this in an interview with our correspondent.

Stressing that the institution was committed to training quality teachers, Akintunde said the entrepreneurial programmes were necessary for the students in the light of the rising unemployment rate and scarcity of white-collar jobs in the country.

He said, “The training programmes are aimed at producing well-rounded teachers with the flexibility to switch to earning a living through skills consciously developed and acquired from the extra-curricular options provided.

“It is also envisioned that the immediate communities around the college would be influenced to embrace training in certain entrepreneurship, vocational and technical education programmes, with the hope that many people would become self-employed in the long term.

“This will reasonably reduce the challenges of unemployment as those trained become engaged in various enterprises as employers of labour.

The provost also said there was a need for the educational system in Nigeria to be restructured from the secondary school level.

“We want to train our students to be self-reliant. There are very many unemployed graduates now because graduates in Nigeria always want government jobs, which are very scarce.”
