AbiodunNejo, Ado Ekiti

Public schools in the 16 council areas of Ekiti State have received N30m worth of books and instructional materials from the state government.

The Ekiti State Governor, KayodeFayemi, while distributing the materials on Wednesday at the State Universal Basic Education Board office in Ado Ekiti, disclosed that pupils in public schools will soon get computers for e-learning to enhance teaching and learning, as well as enable them compete favourably with their peers in any part of the world.

Fayemi, who was represented by his Deputy, Chief BisiEgbeyemi, at the Ministry of Education, , said distribution of the materials was the first phase of his administration’s intervention programme in public secondary schools.

“The gesture is geared towards making teaching and learning conducive in affirmation of determination in restoring the value of the state. It saddens my heart to hear that primary schools in Ekiti State have not been given instructional and working materials since 2016. This is not a good way to achieve effective teaching and learning. The importance of instructional materials in any classroom’s academic process is more than meets the ordinary eye.”

The materials distributed included 17 units of motorcycles, 2,000 cartons of chalk, 450 cartons of red pens, 450 cartons of blue pen, 13,000 diaries; 13,000 registers; 2,000 time books, 2000 chairs and lockers, 550 students laptops, 9,792 copies of science text books, 1,100 set of drawing boards and T-square and 150 building.
