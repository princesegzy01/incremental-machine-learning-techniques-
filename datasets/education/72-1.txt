About 117 students have graduated from the West Africa Theology Seminary, Ipaja, Lagos.

Speaking on the theme, ‘Fearful Future: churches and Cities in the 21st Century Nigeria, during the graduation ceremony, which took on the institution’s campus last Saturday, Dr Emmanuel Oluwayemi, described the church today as being burdened by the fear of environmental catastrophe, the fear of corruption and the fear of church leaders losing their members’ confidence, among others.

Urging the church to call the political leadership of the country into accountability and not just watch, Oluwayemi also challenged the church leadership to educate members about environmental hazards and to create jobs for the unemployed in the society.

He said, “We must let our members know about earthquakes and stop calling global warming demonic attacks. Rather than building mansions and buying private jets, let us build industries and create jobs for the teeming u employed graduates.”

The Prelate of the Methodist of Nigeria, Dr Samuel Uche, was installed as the new Chancellor of the Seminary, replacing Rev Bolanle Gbonigi, during the event.

In his acceptance speech, Uche stressed the need for the seminary to produce graduates that would affect the society positively.

Also, the Provost of the institution, Prof John Brown-Okwii, challenged churches to strengthen their seminaries so as to curb the excesses of televangelists that “preach heresy” on air.

Of the 117 graduands, two graduated with a diploma in Theology, 62 graduated with a B.A in Theology, two graduated with a PDG in Theology, 45 with Master’s Degree and six bagged doctoral degrees.
