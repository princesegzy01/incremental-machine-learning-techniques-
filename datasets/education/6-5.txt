The Chairman of the 2001 set, Mr Akintan Akinyemi said the musical instrument was donated to fill a need in the school.

“The school is presently constructing a music studio for students practice to enhance their intellectual capacity to for vocational and extracurricular activities. Our set felt there is the need to support the school by donating the musical instruments.

“We believe in the idea of supporting our alma mater to inculcate the idea of social responsibility, by giving back to the school in our little way,” Akinyemi said.

The Head Girl of the School, Miss Onome Isibawo, appreciated the alumni for deeming it fit to contribute to the growth and development of the school.
