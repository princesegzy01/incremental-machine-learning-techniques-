2, 000 pupils get solar borehole
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

Over 2,000 pupils of Community High School in the Ologuenru area of Ibadan, Oyo State, will enjoy potable water provided by the Rotary Club of Ibadan-Jericho Metro in the state.

The solar-powered borehole would also serve residents of Idi-Oro Elewa, Ologuneru in the Ido Local Government Area.

The President of the club, Mr Kayode Adelekun, on Wednesday said the facility was donated to improve access to potable water, reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases and keep children healthy.

He said, “The lack of access to clean water is one of the biggest health problems and one of the hardest to solve. Rotary has worked for decades to provide people with clean water by digging wells, laying pipes and providing boreholes.”

Adelekun said the club had set up Rotary Community Corps to assist in maintaining and sustaining the donated facility.

The Chairman of the borehole drilling committee, Mr Gbenga Oduwole, lauded the cooperation of the chiefs and residents of the area for the success of the project.

The president-elect of the district, Mrs Bisi Yomi-Layinka, charged women in the area to make the best use of the project and appealed to the pupils to cooperate with the committee set up to manage the borehole.
