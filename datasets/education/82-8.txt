Korea rewards six Nigerian pupils in speech writing
Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

Six school pupils have emerged winners in speech writing at the fifth Korean Speech Competition in Abuja, winning cash sums of N20,000 and N30,000 to support their education.

The pupils – Operipo Esther, Soo Uke, Akande Toluwanimi, Maduka Providence, Aderogba Oluwaseyi and Afiniki Bossan – were awarded the prizes for displaying their communication skills in the Korean language.

The competition was organised by the Korean Cultural Centre of Nigeria and was aimed at encouraging bilateral educational relationships between Nigeria and Korea.

The director of the Korean centre, Han Sungrae, said one of the pupils was being considered for an all-expenses-paid trip to South Korea to participate further in a language skills programme.

He said, “The competition is to assist language students to improve their communication skills in Korean language.

“The pupils write about the Korean culture and compare it to the Nigerian culture. When the first prize winner emerges, we recommend them for visiting programmes. The judges will pick the recommended winner to visit Korea for certain duration, usually about a week.

“We encourage people to learn more about Korea and its culture and language. The participants have improved greatly.

“The intermediate groups started out as beginners, so this has made them very familiar with the programme and language.”
