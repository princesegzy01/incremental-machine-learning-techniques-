The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Africa in Toru-Orua, Bayelsa State, Prof. Valentine Aletor, has said the university was evolving into a world-class institution where departments, faculties and staff would be Information and Communications Technology compliant.

This was made known recently at a colloquium organised by the faculties of Arts and Education of the institution with the theme, ‘Computer-Assisted Language Learning: The Use of PRAAT’.

The Vice-Chancellor added that the program was to allow members of the academia to share ideas in their areas of specialisation.

“Last week, I announced the setting up of the centre for computer resources and appreciation. The acting Director is Dr Balaburi and the idea would be for us to develop ICT capabilities in terms of reach, bandwidth and deployment of all kinds of devices to make sure that every part of the campus is ICT compliant and will be able to connect to the web.

“We are not there yet but that is our target. We are seeking to attract funds from different agencies to upgrade our ICT capabilities as a university. You can’t come here without being computer literate.

“Last year, on November 28, we were admitted to the World Technology Universities Network, which is a consortium of universities that have decided to make ivory towers impact communities,” Aletor said.

The guest lecturer, Prof. Demola Jolayemi, who was described as Africa’s first digitised linguistic professor, said PRAAT was a computer software critical to linguistic teaching and learning.
