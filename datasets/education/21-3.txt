FGGC Calabar seeks funds for projects
Ada Wodu, Calabar

The Principal of Federal Government Girls’ College, Calabar in Cross River State, Ms Benedicta Okonkwo, says the school has completed six projects in the past one year and is seeking more funds to complete more projects.

Okonkwo made this known at the annual Speech and Prize- Giving Day of the college, where she disclosed that the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Education, enabled the school to renovate two hostels, complete the sports pavilion, renovate the kitchen and dining hall, laboratories, college clinic and construct a shopping complex.

The principal, however, said that more funds were required to take care of landscaping and erosion control, renovation of the staff quarters, employment of more utility staff, among others.

“We have the challenge of funding. If you look round, you will see our facilities, some are in very good shape and some are not. So we need funds to put everything in place,” Okonkwo said.
