Students unionism banned in Ondo Federal poly – Rector
Peter Dada, Akure

The Rector of the Federal Polytechnic, Ile Oluji, Ondo State, Prof. Emmanuel Fasakin, on Monday said there would be no room for a students union government in the institution.

He, however, said the institution would allow constructive unionism that would contribute to the development of the school, as opposed to being destructive.

Fasakin stated this while addressing new students of the institution.

He said, “Many of our students are not mature enough to operate a union on campus. So having a union now can be counter-productive. But when we start our Higher National Diploma programme we can allow a students’ union to exist because at that time we would have admitted mature students.

“We want a students’ union that will be driven towards institutional development and not destruction. We want a union that will guarantee round-the-clock academic stability and tranquillity on campus. All actions and activities of students in this polytechnic are regulated to avoid excesses. As such no students’ association or groups will be allowed to operate unless such has been duly registered though the Students’ Affairs office.”

Fasakin also told the students that the institution had zero tolerance for indiscipline and anti-social behaviour, as he urged them to shun vices such as cultism, examination malpractices, prostitution, among others.

“On our part, we will provide a conducive environment for learning but any student caught involving in vices would be shown the way out of the polytechnic,” the don warned.
