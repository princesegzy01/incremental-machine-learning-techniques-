UNILORIN trains students on cosmetics production
The Technical and Entrepreneurship Centre of the University of Ilorin, Kwara State, has held a training for undergraduate students of the university in making cosmetics and personal health products.

Speaking at the training on Monday, an industrial chemist with the Low Cost Investment, Ibadan, Oyo State, Mr Abdul-Ganiyu Abiodun, urged participants to do their best to become independent.

According to the News Agency of Nigeria, Abiodun said that to survive in the cosmetics and health products business, it was important to produce quality products and maintain the quality.

Abiodun taught the students how to make after-shave , hair cream, candle, disinfectants, body cream and spirit.

In his address, the Director of TEC, Dr Jamiu Odusote, urged the students to take full advantage of the training as it was part of the universityâ€™s drive toward graduating employers of labour rather than job seekers.
