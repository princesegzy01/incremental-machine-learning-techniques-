Ada Wodu, Calabar

Fifty-one first class graduates were among the 9,174 students that graduated from the University of Calabar, Cross River State.

The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Zana Akpagu, made this known on Friday during the 32nd convocation of the institution which kicked off on Wednesday with an interdenominational service.

He said the number of graduating students with first-class degrees was few because “it is difficult to have first class in UNICAL. We want to produce students for the 21st-century market.”

He also said 7,782 students obtained first degrees out of which 2,356 students finished in the second class upper division, 4,532 graduated in the second class lower division, 318 had a third class, while 42 students graduated with pass.

Akpagu added that in the higher degree category, 1,074 students obtained the degrees among which 602 obtained Masters, 251 obtained PhDs, and 221 bagged postgraduate diplomas.

The ceremony saw a former military Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.) bagged an honorary Doctor of Public Administration, while Dr Cletus Ilomuanya was awarded an honorary Doctor of Business Administration. A former governor of Cross River State, Dr Clement Ebri, was awarded an honourary Doctor of Political Science.

The convocation lecture titled, ‘One Nation, One Destiny: The Way Forward’ was delivered on Thursday by a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister for Justice, Godwin Agabi.
