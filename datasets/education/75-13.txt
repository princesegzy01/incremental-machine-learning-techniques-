Twenty-Two Nigerian graduates have commenced a four-month intensive fellowship programme on innovation management, through the Hutzpa Excellence Leadership Programme, an annual training and mentorship programme which selects some of the brightest Nigerian graduates to receive a high-level training on how to solve practical societal problems by applying innovation concepts.

At the recently concluded inauguration programme in Lagos, participants underwent a three-day training where the keynote lecture, themed ‘Scaling Up Excellence for Human Capital Development in Africa’, was delivered by Mr. Sam Ohuabunwa.

Ohuabunwa charged the young professionals to embrace excellence, which he defined as the demand for the first-class mentality in the midst of a third world environment.

While officially declaring the programme open, the Founder and Executive Director of the HELP Fellowship, Mr Obichi Obiajunwa, pointed out that the goal of the programme was to raise leaders who could inspire, initiate, manage and lead innovation in their spheres.

He congratulated the participants for qualifying out of the over 100 applications, as he highlighted the diversity of the group which consisted of persons from 11 states, graduates from 12 Nigerian universities and 17 different disciplines.

Obiajunwa said the 2018 participants were graduates with special skills, who also made a CGPA of 4.0 and above, in their various universities.

The three-day programme was anchored around the workshops designed and facilitated by Israeli-based innovation experts, Messrs Uri Paz and Yahav Levy, who are lecturers at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Business.
