‘Capital market funding would compromise varsities’
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

Lecturers in the Faculty of Arts, University of Ibadan, have said that the Federal Government’s proposed solution to better funding of the nation’s universities by raising money through the capital market was capable of compromising the university system.

They made this known during a one-day colloquium themed, The Nigeria Project and Nationhood, where the lecturers also stated that the move would make institutions chase money at the capital market and jettison their primary duty of imparting knowledge.

Speaking at the event, the Dean of the Faculty, Prof. Ademola Dasylva, said the colloquium became necessary due to the increasing scepticism about the ability of the Nigerian state to meet the needs of citizens politically, economically, educationally, security-wise and in socio-cultural development.

Dasylva said, “The option of funding universities from the capital market is diversionary and misleading, and it would cause incalculable damage to the nation’s university education system. It would make institutions chase money and jettison their primary duty of imparting knowledge. As stakeholders, we shall resist any form of merchandising of education.

“As it stands, the Faculty of Arts is using the ongoing 70th anniversary of the university to contribute to reassessing the Nigerian project and nationhood by bringing together distinguished Nigerians from the six geopolitical zones to discuss the issue. We are not doing this as ethnic jingoists but as concerned individuals who can feel the pulse of their people and present perspectives from which the challenges that confront the Nigerian state can be addressed,” he said.
