Kehinde Oludare and Oluwaseun Makinde have emerged winners of the Teachers’ edition of Cowbellpedia Mathematics Quiz Show.

The event, which was part of the activities organised to mark the 2018 World Teachers Day, saw 12 teachers whose pupils made it to the finals of the 2017 edition of the competition compete for the best in both categories.

Expressing his appreciation to the organisers of the contest, Oludare of Bibo Oluwa Academy, Ilesha, Osun State, who emerged best in the senior category, said, “Beyond passion, Mathematics teachers must have hunger to teach the subject. Initiatives like this have helped to stimulate the interest of pupils and teachers in the subject.

“I loved Mathematics as a pupil and I love Mathematics as a teacher, it is like a pastoral call and anointing and this has been fuelling my hunger to impart this knowledge to my pupils,” Oludare said.

On his part, the best teacher in the junior category, Makinde, of Jesuit Memorial College, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, said, “The victory has given me the opportunity to appreciate the efforts of my pupils more. I now know what the students are going through, It was easy to blame them for lack of speed or errors, but I now know that it is not that easy,” he admitted.
