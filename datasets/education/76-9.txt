The Director-General of the Directorate of Technical Aid Corps, Dr. Pius Osunyikanmi, has said that some countries in Africa, the Caribbeans and the Pacific have made requests for 200 Nigerian professors, to help them strengthen their higher institutions.

The DTAC sends professionals and experts regularly to African, Caribbean and the Pacific states, to help boost their human resource base.

Osunyikanmi, in a statement on Monday, said Liberia alone had signified intention to have 100 teachers and nurses from Nigeria to assist the country in the education and healthcare delivery.

He said, “Today, we have professionals and experts in about 10 countries and deployment is currently ongoing. We are currently engaging Liberia on revamping their education sector.

“The request from Seychelles is receiving our attention. Nigeria’s involvement in restoring democracy to the Gambia is being matched with corresponding manpower particularly in the University of the Gambia and the judiciary.

“We have 32 senior lecturers and professors in their university. We also have three High Court judges. Similarly, we have about 70 senior academics in Uganda and Rwanda.

“The Nigeria flag, currently flying in East Africa, is an evident of our outstanding presence in Zanzibar. In the Caribbeans, our partnership with Jamaica is working particularly in the area of skill transfer in Batik making and woodcarving.”

He commended the President Muhammadu Buhari administration for making the programme a huge success.
