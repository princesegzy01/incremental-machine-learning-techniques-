Patrick Odey, Uyo

The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Uyo in Akwa Ibom State, Prof. Enefiok Essien, has charged the 8,416 matriculating students for the 2018/2019 academic session of the university to study hard and ensure they are among those enlisted into the institution’s “Honour Roll”.

Essien said the “Honour Roll” consisted of students who achieved a cumulative grade point average of 4.5 and above at the end of their academic journey in the institution.

“We have selected 18 students who are potential first class graduates. It is our expectation that this will motivate you to study hard so that you too would also be honoured.”

The professor of law also charged the new students to consider themselves lucky as he insisted that it was mandatory to attend lectures regularly.

Essien also assured the students that they would have a rewarding and wonderful time in the university.

“You all need friends; but choose your friends carefully because you may get into all manner of problems because of the company you keep,” he added.
