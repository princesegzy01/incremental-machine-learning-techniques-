No worker was victimised – AAUA
Peter Dada, Akure

The Management of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, Ondo State, has denied the allegation that it punished its workers for allegedly petitioning the Visitation Panel constituted by the Ondo State Government to investigate the university’s activities.

It was earlier reported in the some media (not The PUNCH) that the management of the institution had punished some members of its staff for submitting petitions to the government.

The university, in a statement signed by the institution’s Head of Information, Protocol and Public Relations, Mr. Sola Imoru, described the story as false.

The statement read in part, “The three cases cited by the publications are fallacious in content and bare in logic.

“To begin with, it is a common knowledge that memoranda written to Visitation Panels are delivered under confidential cover. This truism raises the question of how management would know the author(s) of submitted memoranda.”

“As a creation of the law, management has always been guided by the requirements of the law in all its dealings and will continue to observe the laws in the day-to-day running of the university in its dealings.

“Management would continue to be fair and just in carrying out the daily administration of the university.

The statement affirmed that it is the responsibility of management to deploy and redeploy staff to areas and units where it believes the interests of the University would be better served by its members of staff.
