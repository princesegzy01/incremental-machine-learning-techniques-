A pupil of Scholars Universal Secondary School, Sango-Ota, Ogun State, Ajisafe Solomon, has emerged the runner-up in this yearâ€™s edition of the Young Nigerian Scientists Presidential Award.

Receiving the awardee in her office, the Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mrs. Modupe Mujota, commended Solomon and his school for the feat.

She said the achievement did not come to her as a surprise, but as a testimony to the fact that Ogun had always been known to produce the best in all human endeavours.

While urging Solomon to strive to be the overall winner of the competition in the next edition, she urged other pupils to take a cue from him by studying hard to emerge the best in whatever they do.

The proprietor of the school, Mr. Alonge Timothy, attributed the feat to the support given to the school by the commissioner and officials in the ministry, commending the giant strides and transformation currently going on in the state.

The competition, held at Eagles Square, Abuja, was organised by the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, to develop the interest of young Nigerians in the sciences from the 774 Local Government Areas of the country through competitive examination.
