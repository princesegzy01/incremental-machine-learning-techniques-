Free education can’t work in varsities, says ex-FUTA VC
Peter Dada, Akure

The immediate past Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Prof. Adebiyi Daramola, has said that free university education is not feasible in Nigeria.

Daramola, who identified poor funding as a major challenge facing the Nigerian university system, noted that the introduction of tuition fees in federal universities would go a long way to solve the problem.

The vice-chancellor said this during a briefing held in Akure, the Ondo State capital, where he urged the government and stakeholders in the education sector to find a means of adequately funding federal universities.

He said, “Free education cannot work in a university system. In developed countries, it is not free. So why are we fooling ourselves in Nigeria? If we continue to have free education in our federal universities, the output will continue to be substandard. The payment of tuition fees should be introduced.”

Daramola, however, advised the Federal Government and other stakeholders to provide a means for indigent students to pay their school fees, either in the form of grants or as loans.

The VC, who was recently discharged and acquitted by the Ondo State High Court after being charged for corrupt practices by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, said his ordeal started towards the end of his tenure in FUTA and it was due to his determination to run a prudent administration.

“One major reason I couldn’t achieve as much as I would have wanted was ‘human problems’ and that is not limited to FUTA alone. There are certain elements in Abuja, who for selfish reasons tried to sabotage us, “he said.
