Abiodun Nejo, Ekiti

The Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi, has said that the type of education required to make graduates employable is one that places emphasis on skills.

Fayemi made this known during the swearing-in ceremony of the 2018 Batch C, Stream II National Youths Service Corps members deployed to Ekiti and Kogi states, where he spoke at the 2018 Ekiti Day and Awards organised by Ekiti Parapo, a forum for Ekiti indigenes in Lagos at the Orientation Camp, in the state.

He charged the 1,854 corps members to take the entrepreneurship training given in the camp seriously.

Represented by his deputy, Chief Bisi Egbeyemi, Fayemi said the drills and parade, leadership training, skills acquisition and entrepreneurship development skills received at the camp could turn revenue earners for the fresh graduates.

He said, “Take the trainings seriously, as knowledge without skills is not enough for today’s economy. Entrepreneurship now rules the world. Serve the nation with the spirit of unity and oneness for national development. The essence of NYSC is to rekindle the spirit of nationalism and break the barriers of ethnicity.”

On his part, the NYSC State Coordinator, Mrs Emmanuella Okpongete, who praised the corps members for their level of patriotism, disciplines and enthusiasm, said they would be exposed to rigorous trainings that would transform them to be better Nigerians.

She also appealed to the state government to enhance the facilities at the camp.
