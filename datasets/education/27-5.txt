We’ll stop teachers’ truancy – Kaduna education sec
Dr Ibrahim Danmaraya, the Education Secretary, Chikkun Local Government Education Authority in Kaduna State, has said steps are being taken to check teachers’ truancy.

Danmaraya said in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Thursday in Kaduna that teachers’ truancy and lukewarm attitude to duty were affecting the learning outcomes of primary school pupils.

He said the Chikkun LGEA had commenced unscheduled visit to primary schools within the local government area to track teachers who were not on their duty post for sanction.

He said, “Effective monitoring and supervision is the only way to keep every teacher on their toes to provide quality teaching to pupils and lay a good foundation for their educational development.

“Government cannot continue to train teachers, provide the necessary facilities and instructional materials only for the teachers to stay at home for whatever reason.

“We decided that it is not going to be business as usual and we have been visiting schools and we will continue to do so to see who and who is on seat and who is not on seat.

“Not only that, we want to also see what the teachers are doing in their various classes and whether or not the pupils are learning.”

The secretary also said the LGEA had partnered a number of non-governmental organisations and civil society organisations to strengthen the quality of teaching and learning in primary schools in the area.
