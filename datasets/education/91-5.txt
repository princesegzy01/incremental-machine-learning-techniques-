The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Pax Herbal Clinic and Research Laboratories, Rev. Anselm Adodo, has said that his company has made a deal with three Nigerian universities to introduce degree and certificate courses in Herbal medicine.

Speaking during a press briefing held last Wednesday, Adodo disclosed that the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, was in the process of introducing a Bachelor’s degree programme in Herbal Medicine.

“This is historic and a significant step towards boosting herbal medicine research and development in Nigeria,” he said.

He said that while Samuel Adegboyega University, Ogwa, Edo State was planning to introduce a higher certificate programme in Herbal Medicine, the University of Ibadan had already approved and commenced Masters degree and PhD prgrammes in African Traditional Medicine at its Institute of African studies.

“A course in herbal medicine through the Department of Pharmacy has also been introduced into the medial curriculum at UI,” he said.

Adodo also disclosed that Pax Herbal had begun to collaborate with UI’s Institute of African Studies to offer a professional certificate course in Herbal Medicine.

“This programme aims to empower existing practising traditional healers to professionalise their practice,” he concluded.
