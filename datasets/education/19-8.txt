Over 8,000 parents and pupils have expressed readiness to attend the inaugural Nigeria Back-To-School Festival on September 7.

This was made known in a statement by the festival’s Event Director, George Agbanelo, on Thursday.

He said, “The event is the country’s premier and the biggest marketplace for everything about school; from school supplies to pupils’ bank accounts, beverages and snacks, school books and kits, as well as computers and software. It is the one-stop event for parents and pupils.”

Agbanelo also disclosed that the event would provide a platform for parents, pupils, educationists and the general public to explore a marketplace with over 100 vendors offering unmatched products and services with huge discounts.

“Aside from the exhibitions, the Back-To-School Festival will feature a series of masterclasses aimed at updating school owners, administrators, teachers and non-teaching staff with the latest trends and body of knowledge that will assist them to better manage, administer and teach in their schools. These well-tailored and expert-curated talks will deliver topics covering school management and administration, financing, security and safety, health and psychology.

“From educational software and hardware to security and supplies, the EduTech pavilion will offer a unique platform for school owners and parents to explore the latest trends in the industry. The festival will present prospects for educational institutions to showcase and market educational opportunities, admit prospective pupils, create new partnerships and alliances, as well as boost their school’s brand exposure,” he said.
