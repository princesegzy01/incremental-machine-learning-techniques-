No plan to increase fees — AAUA
Peter Dada, Akure

The management of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko in Ondo State, has denied some social media reports that claimed the institution had increased its fees.

The institution described the reports as untrue and mischievous, saying there was no plan by the university to increase the fees.

According to a source, the reports had caused confusion among the students of the institution, who are preparing for a new session.

In a statement issued by the Registrar of the institution, Dr Michael Ayerun and made available to our correspondent on Monday, the university called on parents and students to disregard the report.

The statement read, “The attention of the university’s management has been drawn to the rumour being circulated on social media that the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, had increased its tuition fees.

“The university is hereby using this medium to inform our highly esteemed students, parents, guardians and the entire public that it did not increase or propose to increase its tuition fees.

“In other words, the tuition fees regime of last academic session (2017/2018) still subsists in 2018/2019 academic session. As such, students are to pay the fees they paid last academic session for the 2018/2019 academic session.”
