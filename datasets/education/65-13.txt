ASAP extends entries submission for essay competition
To encourage more students to participate in the second edition of the Academics Stand Against Poverty Essay Competition, closure for entries has been extended to December 10.

This year’s edition, according to the organisers, is tagged, ‘Impact of Leadership and Governance on Poverty Alleviation in Africa,’ and the extension would give more students of tertiary institutions the opportunity to take part.

This was made known by the Coordinator of ASAP West Africa, Mr. Oluwseun Olanrewaju, who urged participating students to submit an essay of not more than 3,000 words as well as a short profile of 150 words. He stated, “Students are to send a profile that states their name, institution, course of study and year of study. Entries will close on December 10, 2018, and the winner will be announced on January 10, 2019. Like last year, the winner of this second edition will receive a cash prize of N250, 000. However, students should avoid submitting more than one entry or plagiarising, so as not to be disqualified.”

It would be recalled that a final year medical student of the University of Nigeria, Nsuka, Chinedu Mpamugo, won the maiden edition of the Academics Stand Against Poverty Essay Competition.
