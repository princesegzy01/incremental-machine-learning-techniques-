VC wants NUC to include Nigeria’s unity in curriculum
Mudiaga Affe, Calabar

Vice-Chancellor of the Cross River University of Technology, Prof. Anthony Owan-Enoh, has urged the National University Commission to include foundational issues on the unity of the country in schools’ curriculum.

Owan-Enoh stressed at a public lecture in Calabar to mark the 80th birthday of the pioneer vice-chancellor of the institution, Prof. Kelvin Etta, that the country’s unity was one notable aspect of the national life that was sacrosanct and not negotiable.

He, therefore, called on the NUC not to be concerned only with matters of quality and curriculum, but to include in the curriculum foundational issues of unity which were capable of restoring the nation’s fast vanishing cohesion.

Owan-Enoh said, “The heterogeneous nature of our country cannot be washed away. It is a fact which makes the need for common understanding an ever pressing one.

“The commission should cease to be merely concerned with matters of quality and curriculum to include in the curriculum, foundational issues of unity which are capable of undermining the nation’s fast vanishing cohesion from what is going on in universities.”

Speaking on the theme: Dialectics of university and development in Nigeria, Owan-Enoh called on Nigerians to follow the footsteps of the founding fathers who fought tirelessly to keep the country as one united indivisible entity notwithstanding the ethno-religious and cultural affinity which existed at that time.
