Alumni donate equipment to Oyo school laboratory
Olufemi Atoyebi, Ibadan

The 1985/86 set of the Methodist Secondary Grammar School, Elekuro, Ibadan, Oyo State, has donated laboratory equipment to aid the teaching of science in the school.

At an event held to express their appreciation to the school, members of the set, led by its President, Kayode Oyediran, also presented awards to some of its former teachers.

In his speech, Oyediran praised the contribution of the teachers to the success of the set members, while also promising that the alumni would be consistent in supporting the school.

The Principal, Mr. Akinboade Olatunji, commended the old pupils for their collaborative efforts towards lifting the status of the school, while calling on other sets to help it. He added that government could not provide all the needs of the school because of other sectors that needed government attention.

“Moral values have been debased in many schools nowadays unlike in the past. The funding of education cannot be left for the government alone. This is why efforts of old students like this should be welcome to salvage our schools and the education sector in order to have a saner future for our present students. Other sets should also emulate this gesture, but I implore you to extend your donation beyond the science class in order to engender an all-round educational development,” he said.

The awardees, some of whom had retired from service, expressed happiness that the legacy they bequeathed to their students could be appreciated while they were still alive.
