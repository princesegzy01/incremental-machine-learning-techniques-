‘Parents must always encourage their children’
The Vice-Chairman, Greatness Garden College, Warewa, Ogun State, Mr Taiwo Kolawole, has urged parents to incessantly encourage their children so they do not lose their way in life.

He made this known at the school’s valedictory service and music concert held on Friday at the school’s premises.

While urging the 38 graduates of the school to be focused in achieving their goals, Kolawale said, “If you want your children to manifest greatness, there must be answers to certain questions. Tell your children that they are not small people, they are products of God. Let them know who they are. Use your words to continuously encourage them. If not they will end up being who they are not.

“Ensure your children know where they are going so that they remain focused and not give in to any distraction and end up being delayed in life. To achieve what God has destined our children to be, we need to put them where they can acquire knowledge to achieve their destiny.

“Wisdom is the correct application of knowledge acquired; hence, we pray our children will be wise. Know that the greatness of your children starts now. They will be the light of their generation.”

Pleased with the success of the ceremony, the Proprietress, Mrs Merry Ikeashi-Williams, said, “This is a great day in the lives of my children. They are all my children. This is just the beginning of their greatness, they have been made and born great and it will be unleashed as they go forth and be great.”
