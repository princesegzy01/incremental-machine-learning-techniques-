Include us in feeding programme, private school owners urge FG
Adekunle Peter, Benin

The Association of Private School Owners of Nigeria has appealed to the Federal Government to capture private schools in its school feeding programme.

They made the appeal on Wednesday at the association’s inaugural national executive council meeting and retreat themed, Sustaining the Vision and Mission of Private School Participation in a Contemporary Nigeria Society, co-hosted by the Edo and Delta chapters of the association and held in Benin City, Edo State.

The National President of APSON, Godly Opukeme, urged the government to rescind its decision to limit the programme to public schools.

“We want to appeal to the Federal Government to rescind its decision to exclude private schools from its school feeding programme. As far as we are concerned, we are tax payers, our teachers and parents are also tax payers. We should be carried along. I remember that when they were campaigning with the school feeding programme, they did not mention public school children only. The Federal Government should not treat us like that. Our children should be carried along.”
