The Principal of Federal Government College, Lagos, Dr Olufunmilayo Essien, has called on the ministries of sports to pay a close attention to sporting activities in secondary schools in order to discover budding athletes that will represent the country on the world stage.

Essien, who spoke on Saturday during the college’s 41st Annual Inter-House Sports competition in Ijanikin, Lagos, said Nigeria could be a hub of sports if stakeholders focused more on schools by organising periodic competitions in primary and secondary schools where young athletes could be discovered and groomed.

“Colleges like ours are places where talents abound in diverse areas of sports. For instance, our college, in recent times, has turned out to be a breeding ground for sports talents in this country. That is why we are calling on all sports stakeholders, like the ministries of sport, sports councils of states and others to step up efforts in the development of sports at the grass roots.

“Stakeholders should live up to their responsibilities by scouting for young athletes who have done well in the various sports so they can be groomed for excellence. One finds out that the children participate and excel in their respective areas of interest; sometimes they even break records, but it only ends in the college and this should not be the case. If the country hopes to excel in international sports events, it must look inward, support and encourage sports at the grass roots, especially at colleges,” Essien said.
