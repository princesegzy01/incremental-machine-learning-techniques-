Peter Dada, Akure

The United State Agency for International Development says it is set to provide technical assistance to Adeyemi College of Education in Ondo State on the Farmer-to-Farmer programme.

The US agency said the assistance would involve the provision of technical support to staff and students of the institution to build capacity and enhance efficiency.

The West African Regional Director of Winrock International, Mr Mike Bassey, stated this at a meeting with senior members of staff of the college, held at the School of Vocational and Technical Education of the ACE.

According to Bassey, the programme would assist farmers, agribusinesses, education and extension providers in developing countries to promote sustainable improvement in the agricultural sector.

“The F2F activities were introduced by the global organisation with the aim of equipping a new generation of agricultural educators, technicians, farmers and agribusinesses, to enable them to address evolving challenges facing agricultural sector in all the countries,” he said.

Bassey also said the population of students in the ACE would serve as an added advantage when the programme took off in the institution.

He explained that the implementation of the programme would be in phases; the assessment of facilities and the provision of improvement grant by the global body.

In his remarks, the Provost of ACE, Dr Samuel Akintunde, by the USAID noted that the move would take the institution and the community to a higher level.
