The acting Provost of the Federal College of Education (Technical), Yaba, Lagos State, Mr Ephraim Dada, has urged the Federal Government to improve the remuneration of teachers to promote interest in the profession and reduce teacher deficit presently being experienced in the country.

He made this known at the matriculation of 794 students for the 2018/2019 academic session at the college.

Dada said, “According to NUT, every state has a deficit of 10,000 teachers. Many parents do not want their children to go into education because of the poor welfare of teachers. There is nothing wrong with being a teacher but presently, it is when there is no other option that people come into teaching. The government should employ more teachers; we have many people who graduated with first class that are willing to teach but because teachers are poorly paid, they wil rather go into other professions.”

He said the college, in affiliation with the University of Benin, ran Bachelor of Science Education and Bachelor of Arts programmes and would soon matriculate degree students.

The President of the Student Union Government of the college, Mr Olajide Abdul-hameed, in his speech, advised the student to make the right decisions during their time as a student.
