Oriflame Foundation and SOS Children’s Villages have concluded arrangement to send 50 children back to school as a way of giving orphans a new lease of life.

The Co-founder of Oriflame, Mr Robert Jochnick, stated this on Monday during a briefing held in Lagos recently.

Jochnick said, “In 2016 and 2017, the company collaborated with Inner City Mission to send kids back to school. Now it is partnering the SOS Villages to send 50 kids back to school. “Other people can emulate this. There are many other ways that people can contribute. One is by actively becoming involved in their local projects and fundraising activities, or supporting local charities.”

The founder also stated that the company had developed accessories and products being sold specifically to raise funds.

Also, the Oriflame’s Vice President, Mr Amir Mortazavi, stressed the company’s commitment to corporate social responsibility.

This, he said, informed the collaboration with SOS to assist children to get quality education.

Apart from the send-children-back-to-school programme, Mortazavi said the company was also involved ensuring job satisfaction for workers through a feedback mechanism it recently initiated.

He said, “The company has launched the concept of Employee Net Promoter System with the aim of getting continuous feedback from the employees and address improvement areas with the company. This is because the people behind Oriflame are the reason for the company’s success.”
