‘Collaboration in academic communities essential for safe schools’
Dayo Ojerinde

The convener of the Nigerian Safe School Week Initiative, Mr Adedayo Oshunmakinde, has stressed the need for collaboration among academic communities, the government, civil society, religious groups, parents and students towards creating schools that are welcoming, safe and inclusive.

In a statement made available to our correspondent, Oshunmakinde said the campaign was set to step up actions on how to better protect Nigeria’s schools against all forms of violence, as well as potential threats, which, if no measure was taken, could endanger the educational objective.

“Through this campaign, activities like training, community sensitisation and emergency preparedness drills are being packaged for this programme, so as to prepare the academic communities for unforeseen challenges, awaken the courage of adults and children on school safety matters, and to coordinate the security of schools across the country and the communities in which they are located.

“This initiative defines everyone’s role as per school safety matters, and ready to connect voices as against any antisocial behaviour within the school environment, and that of the security challenges confronting the society which children are the most vulnerable of,” he said.
