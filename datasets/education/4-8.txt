the Executive Director and Founder of Live Abundantly Initiative, Dr Ama Onyerima, has said the education of the girl child will end the cycle of violence, exploitation, poverty, and inequality.

Onyerima said this on Thursday in Lagos at an event organised by the Lagos State Government School Based Committee Mothers’ Association to mark the International Day of the Girl Child.

She said, “It is important to empower the girl child because the girl of today will become a mother tomorrow. Education is key to breaking the cycle of violence, exploitation, poverty, and inequality.

“We also have to end discrimination against the girl child in our society. We need to empower female children to make them relevant in the economic and social sphere.”

Onyerima also called on parents to put an end to child labour, which she also described as a violation of the fundamental right of children.

“Child labour is an exploitation of the child to have him or her work to feed the family, it is a violation against their fundamental rights,” she said.

The Chairman of the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board, Hon. Wahab Alawiye-King, lamented the statistics of out-of-school girls in some part of the state.

Alawiye-King, who was represented by a member of SUBEB in Lagos State, Mrs Sijuade Idowu-Tiamiyu, said, “In the schools in Lagos State, we have 50 per cent of male pupils and 50 per cent of female pupils. But we should not be happy about the statistics. If you go to Makoko, Ajegunle, Ojo, Egbeda, Ikorodu, and Iyana-Iba you will know that girls are out of school. We must all do our best to make sure that these girls are back to school.”
