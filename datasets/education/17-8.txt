Gibson Achonu, Owerri

The Headmistress of Owerri Township Primary School, Imo State, Mrs MaryRose Duru, has charged primary school pupils to desist from obnoxious activities such as drug abuse, cultism and telling lies in order to become meaningful citizens of Nigeria.

She also advised them to be respectful, honest, loyal and of good morals in order to excel in life.

Duru gave this charge on Thursday during the graduation of 30 nursery and 140 primary school pupils for the 2018/2019 academic session.

She stated that strict adherence to advice by children would better the future generation of the country.

“When you shun cultism, drug abuse and other vices and embrace loyalty, good morals thought, respectfulness among others, you will be become greater and better human beings in the nearest future,” she said.

She admonished parents to give children the much-needed care and advice to help them forge ahead.

“Always remember the biblical injunction which says train up a child in a way he should go, that when he grows, he will not depart from it. Do not relent in your efforts at training them because they are your treasure. God will surely be with you as you do this,” Duru added.

She thanked the pupils, who she said had done well in both school and external examinations and appealed to them to keep the flag of the school flying wherever they go to.

In his speech, one of the graduating primary school pupils, Akuchukwu Udonna, commended the management of the school for the way they groomed them in psychomotor, cognitive and affective domains of learning.
