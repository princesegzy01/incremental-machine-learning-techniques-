Peter Dada, Akure

The Police Secondary School, Akure, the Ondo State capital, has appealed to the education unit of the Nigeria Police Force to provide more infrastructural facilities to the school.

The Commandant of the school, Mr Peter Augustine, said the it needed more classrooms, hostels and vehicles.

Augustine made the appeal when the Force Education Officer, Mrs Rabi Labaran, paid an official visit to the school.

The commandant, who commanded the Police Education Unit for the provision of already existing facilities on the premises of the school, said the school needed more facilities to accommodate its 2,000 students and 300 members of staff.

He said, “I want to thank God for your leadership quality since you assumed office in the unit. Things have improved immensely, starting from the promotion of staff, provision of infrastructure, especially a new boys hostel; provision of books and materials to the pupils on time for effective teaching and learning.

“However, we are also in need of more hostels, more classrooms and a school bus. We believe that you will use your good office to make these available to us. “

In her remarks, Labaran said the police had over 100 secondary schools across the country. She described the Akure police school as the best in terms of structure and patronage.

The education officer also gave the assurance that the police authorities would look into the needs of the school for appropriate action.
