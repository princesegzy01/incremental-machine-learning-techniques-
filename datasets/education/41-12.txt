Pupils design app to curb underage smoking

Three pupils, Oluwatunmise Ayeni, Rotimi Adegbiyi and Egie Akede, all in Senior Secondary School one at Dansol High School, have designed the ‘RET Vape Selling App’, an application that can be used to end underage smoking.

Designed as part of the requirements to participate in the 2019 Conrad Foundation’s Spirit of Innovation Challenge, the application has taken the pupils to the final stage of the competition in the Smoke-Free World USA category.

Under their company, RET Innovate, the pupils told our correspondent on Tuesday that the application would help e-cigarette retailers in America detect the age of prospective buyers even if they have a fake identity card, flag underage smokers and serve as a source of smoking history for regulating agencies and hospitals.

Being guided by their coach, Mr Tochi Nkwocha, a Chemistry teacher in their school, the innovators also said the application would offer e-counselling when an underage smoker was flagged.

For Nigeria, the pupils promised that even though the application was presently designed for America, a Nigerian adaptation, which the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency could use to end underage smoking in the country, was underway.
