Gibson Achonu, Owerri

The Headmistress of Owerri Township Primary School, Imo State, Mrs MaryRose Duru, has advised the pupils of the school to stay away from obnoxious activities such as drug intake, cultism and lies in order to become meaningful citizens of Nigeria.

On the contrary, she advised them to be respectful, honest, loyal and of good morals in order to excel in life.

Duru gave this advice during the graduation ceremony of 30 nursery and 140 primary pupils of the school for the 2018/2019 academic session.

She stated that strict adherence to the advice by the children would better the future generation of the country.

“When you shun cultism, drug abuse and other vices and embrace loyalty, good moral thought, respectfulness among others, you will become greater and better human beings in the nearest future,” she said.

Continuing, the headmistress admonished parents to give children the much-needed care and advice to help them forge ahead.

“Always remember the biblical injunction which says train up a child in a way he should go, that when he grows he will not depart from it. Do not relent in your efforts in training them because they are your treasure. God will surely be with you as you do this,” Duru added.

In his speech, one of the graduating primary school pupils, Akuchukwu Udonna, commended the management of the school for the way they groomed them in psychomotor, cognitive and affective domains of learning.

The highlight of the ceremony was inaugural graduation lecture themed, “Neighbourhood Love and Community Service”, delivered by the International Coordinator of Good Governance Initiative, Evangelist Sam Ezeji.
