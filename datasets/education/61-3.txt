Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Polytechnics, South West zone, has frowned on the disposition of the governors over the alleged poor funding of polytechnics in their respective states.

SSANIP, in a statement signed by its Zonal Coordinator, Banjo Ogunsipe and Zonal Secretary, Sunday Komolafe, said the body was worried about the poor funding of polytechnics and tertiary institutions in general.

The association made its stand known after rising from its zonal meeting held at the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, where it also noted that education remained the most viable and sellable point of the South West.

The association said, “We have therefore resolved to bring the issue of poor funding to the front burner so as to chart a progressive course for the sustenance of polytechnic education in the South West. We condemn, in strong terms, the suspension of the activities of the Ibarapa Polytechnic, Eruwa chapter of the association because the polytechnic’s management lacked the power to either suspend or proscribe the activities of the chapter was established by law. We, therefore, call for the immediate reinstatement of the chapter’s executive to keep us from taking drastic actions.”
