Gibson Achonu, Owerri

A lecturer in the Department of Chemistry, Federal Polytechnic, Nekede in Imo State, Dr Samuel Okore, has called on the Federal Ministry of Education to review its curriculum in science education.

Okore also urged the ministry to ensure that all science programmes in secondary schools across the country were supported with Information Communication Technology programmes in order to safeguard the growth of science in the country.

The lecturer, while presenting the virtual laboratory he developed to journalists in Owerri, the state capital, on Monday, advised that chemistry teachers should be upgraded periodically to keep them abreast of latest developments in ICT across the globe.

He said, “My new innovative programme is meant to assist students to conduct practical chemistry directly from the Internet and it is divided into three main features. There is analytical laboratory. There is no waste of chemicals or fake materials. It saves money and protects students from all sorts of risks and hazards while taking care of fake and adulterated chemicals”

Okorie, who is a member of the Computer Registration Council of Nigeria, Computer Society of Nigeria and Chemical Society of Nigeria listed chemists and students of chemistry as end consumers of his innovation.
