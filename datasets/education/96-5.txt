The Civil Liberties Organisation, Bayelsa State chapter, and the Ijaw Youth Council Worldwide have condemned the closure of the state-owned Niger Delta University, Amassoma, over protests by students of the institution.

The students had reportedly staged a protest against an alleged increase in tuition fees by the management of the university.

The State Chairman, CLO, Chief Nengi James, condemned the attack on the President of the Student Union Government of the institution, describing it as an act of intimidation.

James called on Governor Seriake Dickson to intervene and stop the planned expulsion of the SUG leaders over their role in the protest.

He said that investigation by the field officers of the CLO showed concern over the alleged human rights abuses against the students and the SUG leadership of the Institution following the protest.

He said, “We discovered that the institution’s management increased the school fees without due consultation with the stakeholders. And after the protest by students, some hired miscreants attacked the students in order to silence their rights to expression and speech.

“We have also discovered that the institution’s management is planning to expel the SUG leaders and other students over their alleged involvement in the protest against hike in school fees.

“The CLO condemns in totality the plot by the NDU to silence the students by assaulting the SUG leaders and the planned expulsion of some students. We are ready to use available legal means to support the students over the need for the protection of rights as guaranteed by law.”

The CLO chairman said the organisation had mobilised a legal team and members of the alumni of the school to save the students from being expelled from the institution.

Calling on Dickson to address the grievances of the students that led to the protest and eventual closure of the school on April 25, the IYC said, “The NDU is to the Ijaw nation what the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria is to northern Nigeria. The NDU is also to the Ijaw what the University of Nigeria, Nsukka is to the Igbo.

“It is also to the Ijaw nation what the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife is to the Yoruba. And just like the NDU was founded by the late Ijaw leader, Chief Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, these universities were founded by the leaders of the Yoruba, Igbo and the North to give their people access to university education.

“Hence, all efforts must be made to protect the founding philosophy of the Niger Delta University by our late leader, Alamieyeseigha, which was to give Ijaw people access to university education in a school they can call their own.

“The Bayelsa State Government must note that a vast majority of students of the NDU are children of poor Ijaw people who cannot afford high charges.”
