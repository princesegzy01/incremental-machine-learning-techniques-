The Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Babcock University, Prof. Sunday Owolabi, has advised pupils to be careful whenever they are on social media.

Owolabi said this on Thursday during the graduation ceremony of Babcock University Schools in Ogba, Lagos.

He decried the excessive use of social media stating that it distracted youths from the real world.

“Social media is not a bad place to be, but there must be checks and balances for the young ones. If you are not careful this virtual friend will snatch you away from the real world.

“There are so many things in the world of social media distracting pupils. As parents and teachers, we need to be closer to the young ones. Beware of online friends; it is not the safest place to discuss your personal issues,” Owolabi advised.

The principal of Babcock University Schools, Gabriel Fasanu, also charged the pupils to be good ambassadors of the school and uphold the legacies instilled in them during their time in the college.

He said, “This is the best time to prove to the world that knowledge and decency has been instilled in you during your stay in this great school. I charge you not to disappoint the school, your family and our nation, as you journey further in life.”
