60% of teachers in Niger not qualified – Bello
Enyioha Opara, Minna

Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State has said that 60 per cent of teachers are not qualified to teach in public schools across the 25 local government areas of the state.

Bello, who made this known on Thursday at the Niger State Teachers Professional Development Institute Implementation Committee, maiden End-of-the-year Academic Day Programme at Mararaban Dandaudu, however, said the teachers would not be sacked.

“We will not sack these unqualified teachers, but we will train those that are trainable and those we cannot train will be asked to go back to school,” he said.

The governor explained that to ensure qualitative education and quality teachers, the teaching profession would have to be regulated, saying, “Until a teacher is qualified, he or she will not be allowed to teach.”

Also lamenting on the condition of facilities in schools in the state, he said, “With the present condition, especially in boarding schools, there is no way we can produce a good future as these children will feel that we did not take good care of them. That is why we must try to give them some level of comfort.”

Applauding the committee of the teachers institute led by Hajiya Dije Bala, the governor disclosed plans by his administration to set up additional centres in Agaie and Borgu

Earlier, the Commissioner for Education, Hajiya Fatima Madugu, commended the Niger State Government for its commitment to the education sector, particularly, the Whole School Approach initiative.
