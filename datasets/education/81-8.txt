Call to Love Initiative, founded in 2010, is set to hold the 2018 Make A Difference with Education programme, which it said, was established as a comprehensive solution to some of the problems in the educational sector.

Made known in a statement, the foundation states that its objective is to “provide all-round support to children who, without the additional support, might not be able to complete their education and are thus, unlikely to attain their full potential.

“Specifically, the intervention involves the physical improvement of the general teaching environment of public primary schools, provision of academic, social and financial support to individual beneficiaries.”

On the summer camp, the statement read, “The annual skills summer camp brings together stakeholders such as mentors, teachers, technical and vocational education specialists, to create a learning environment which reforms the beneficiaries, and ensures a more wholesome education.

“Beneficiaries of the Skills Summer Camp will be provided with scholarship opportunities. Over the course of six days, the MWE Summer Camp will deliver free training in information technology, entrepreneurship, leadership, etiquette, public speaking, team orientation, organisation skills, and vocations such as basket weaving, tie-dye, bead-making, as well as painting.”

The camp will also feature an exhibition for participants to showcase and sell crafts from their trainings, as well as a prize giving session.
