Tunde Oyekola, Kwara

The management of the University of Ilorin has concluded arrangements to build four 1,500 capacity lecture theatres to take care of the rising population of students.

This was made known by the Director of the Physical Planning Unit in the university, Dr Bashir Adams, who added that plans were also at an advanced stage to construct a radio and television house on the campus.

Adams stated that the university would soon commence the construction of 42 toilets for students, as he added that the ongoing extension of the institution’s library was part of the school’s efforts to be responsive to the growing number of the students.

He said the university was prudent in the management of funds, had no record of abandoned projects, and had ensured that standard was not compromised.

This he credited to the regular mobilisation of contractors, as he commended the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Sulyman Abdulkareem, for operating an open-door policy and transparent government, especially in the areas of project execution.
