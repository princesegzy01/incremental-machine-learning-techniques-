Old pupils of Nwafor Orizu Demonstration Nursery and Primary School, Awka, Anambra State have renovated the institution with N6m.

The former pupils, who left the school in 1989, renovated class buildings, built toilets, provided whiteboards and sundry learning tools.

Speaking on behalf of the old pupils, Amobi Ogum said they decided to carry out the project because of the deteriorating condition of infrastructure in the school.

He said the project gulped not less than N5.7m which was generated through freewill donations by about 15 of them.

He said, “The idea was conceived in October last year, while the funds were raised in April this year.

“We got linked up through the internet and decided to give back to the society that gave us so much.

“We were about 35 during our set but about 15 of us were involved in this project. Some of us came from Europe, the US and the UK.

“We repainted the entire school, tiled the classrooms, provided white boards, renovated the toilet facilities and erected new ones.”

Also speaking, Chuka Uzozie said,”The motivation was borne out of nostalgia of the impact the school and teachers made on us.

“That’s why we decided to honour five of the teachers today.”
