The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria has inducted no fewer than 130 teachers, who graduated from Corona College of Education recently.

The teachers graduated with the National Certificate of Education and the Professional Diploma Certificate in Education for the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 academic sessions.

At the ceremony, the Registrar and Chief Executive of TRCN, Prof. Josiah Ajiboye, lauded the college for its efforts at professionalising teaching and providing the needed knowledge the profession needs.

Ajiboye said, “Induction of teachers at the point of graduation is the most important academic ritual that initiates graduates into the profession. It exposes them to near real-life experiences in their chosen career. It allows them to see the dynamics of the world and attendant rights, as well as challenges inherent as a fresher in the profession.”

He added that the quality of education in any society depended largely on the quality of the teachers which reflected the regulation and control of the profession. “ The quality of education can only be guaranteed by professional teachers whose delivery, poise, ability, coordination and general management of the classroom activities leads to qualitative transformation of the pupils.”

The guest speaker, Dr Emmanuel Filani, posited that conversations around education in the country without teachers’ education was incomplete because of the position they occupied in national development.
