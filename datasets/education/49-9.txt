AbiodunNejo, Ado Ekiti

The Pro-Chancellor and Chairman, Governing Council of Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, by the Governor of Ekiti State, Dr KayodeFayemi, Prof Bamitale Omole has said the council will prioritise education, research and infrastructural development with a view to repositioning the university.

Omole, who is a laureate of the USA International Visitors Leadership Programme and a former Vice-Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, also said the council’s first assignment would be to implement the White Paper Report to redress the rot in the institution and reposition it.

The Chairman, who spoke with journalists in Ado Ekiti after the inaugural meeting of the Governing Council, said: “The first thing we are going to do now is to implement the White Paper Report. That is the first priority. A lot of rot in all the tertiary institutions was identified in the visitation panels’ reports. The White Paper set the task for us – implement, reposition.

“By the time we implement it in the areas of administration, governance, finance and infrastructure, this university will be the Primus Interperes, first among equals. Most important for us as a council is to show that EKSU holds its own in the comity of universities. For Ekiti, we were known to be knowledge capital for Nigeria, but we have lost it for years, but now that we are in this university, with my new council, we are determined to bring back that lost glory.”
