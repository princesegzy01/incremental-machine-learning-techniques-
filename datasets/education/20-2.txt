In the bid to reduce the rising population of out-of-school children, the Proprietress of De Joyland Schools, Mrs Abimbola Osaghae, has called on the government and well-meaning individuals to ensure that all children have access to schools.

Osaghae also said the failure of the government to provide basic education to all children was an infringement on their right to quality education.

She said this at the seventh valedictory service of the school in Yaba, Lagos, where she decried the rising number of out-of-school children.

“Basic education is key in the life of all and sundry. My advice to the government and the people is that we do everything possible to make education accessible for all children. It is the right of all individuals.

“The benefits of basic education are enormous and it is meant to prepare pupils for the future, which is why it is a vital part of their lives that must be taken seriously. Lack of adequate education is the reason society lacks peace. Depriving a child of education is equal to killing the child,” the proprietress said.

Also, the Chief Executive Officer of Leading Learning Limited, Folashade Adefisayo, advised teachers to go for continued training to help them function better, as she urged the government to continue to invest in the education sector.
