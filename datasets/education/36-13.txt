UMTE: Okebukola seeks equal opportunity for blind candidates

A Former Secretary-General of the National University Commission, Prof. Peter Okebukola, has said blind candidates deserve equal opportunities like their sighted counterparts in the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination.

Okebukola, in an interview with our correspondent on Wednesday at the blind candidates’ centre in Lagos, said five blind candidates’ centres were set up in the country to give equal opportunity to blind candidates.

He said, “The JAMB registrar, Prof Is-haq Oloyede, when he came on board said blind candidates and prison inmates should be able to write UTME. The intention is to provide a level-playing field; they sit for the same exams with other candidates that are not blind. What we do is that since they cannot see, we read the questions to them and they write in braille.

“Meanwhile, we are developing a technology that will be used in another one year or two years whereby blind candidates can sit for their computer-based tests like other candidates who are not blind.”

The former NUC Executive Secretary added that the marking scheme for blind candidates was the same as other candidates that can see.

“They don’t have a separate marking scheme so that no one will say they pass the examination and gained admission because they are blind,” Okebukola said.

He urged universities to create avenues for blind candidates to sit for post-UTME exams like their counterparts who were sighted.Copyright PUNCH.
