The Vice-Chancellor of Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State, Prof. Ignatius Onimawo, said the introduction of computer-based examinations for 100 and 200 level students, had reduced the workload of lecturers of the institution.

Onimawo who disclosed this during an interview with journalists in Ekpoma said the move was meant to check examination malpractice and sexual harassment of female students by some lecturers.

He, however, disclosed that some lecturers were not happy with the computer-based examination at first.

“They were not happy initially, but now one thing that they have discovered is that this system has also helped in marking many scripts.

“For instance, a course like GST is offered by about 7,000 students; do you expect the lecturer to mark them within six weeks to submit results?” he disclosed.

While explaining the reasons for the introduction of computer-based examinations, the Vice-Chancellor said experience showed that new students were intimidated by unscrupulous lecturers.
