‘Scientific predictions could prevent disasters’
Dayo Ojerinde

A Professor of Mathematics at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, Samuel Okoya, has stressed the importance of scientific predictions in mitigating the effect of environmental disasters.

Okoya said this while presenting a paper titled, ‘Predictions Based on Mathematical Models for National development’, at the maiden edition of International Conference on Development Sciences and Technologies, held at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta.

He said that predictions based on sufficient data have helped many countries in America, Europe, and Asia with advanced warnings of heat waves, hurricanes, cyclones and tornadoes, as well as allowed communities at risk to evacuate before the impending disaster strikes.

Citing the earth tremor that occurred in September 2018 at Mpape and another incident in November 2018 at Maitama District, both in Abuja, Okoya said, these events brought about significant challenges and devastating effects on people living around the affected areas.

He urged the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency to embrace long term earthquake monitoring, as events like these were highly preventable.

“In our general obligation to build a hospitable and sustainable society, we need to develop the necessary mathematical equations (models) of the environmental data and processes, and solve the mathematical problems leveraging on supercomputers of modest size today.”

“Motivation for young Nigerians to study these scientific processes should be connected to getting functional knowledge around safe storage, handling, and transportation of gaseous and volatile liquid fuels,” Okoya said.
