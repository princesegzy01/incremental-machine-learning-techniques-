Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

The Commandant of the Nigerian Air Force Institute of Technology, Kaduna, Air Vice-Marshal, Cletus Udeagulu, on Monday said the Federal Government had given approval to the institution to start degree programmes.

The Commandant stated this at a briefing held in Kaduna, ahead of the 47th convocation of the institute.

Udeagulu also announced a new course in Aerospace Engineering at the Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Science degree levels to reflect the current status as a degree-awarding institution. This, he said, was in addition to the certificate and National Diploma being offered by the institute.

The commandant said, “I am delighted to inform you that on December 5, 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari assented to the bill upgrading the institute to a degree-awarding university.”

He said the institute would soon attain a world class standard because of its peculiar choice for the study of Aerospace and Defence Engineering.

Udeagulu also noted that the institute had made inroads in research and development, as well as successfully launched an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

He said, “Not resting on our oars, there are projects initiated by five members of the staff of the institute and students that will be displayed at the venue of the convocation ceremony. They are the Sun Tracker, Rocket Launcher Tester, Shock Absorber, Constructed Surveillance Airship and Fabricated Hexacopter.”
