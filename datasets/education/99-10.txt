Technical University, Ibadan will today (Tuesday) sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Nigeria Society of Engineers and Automation and Engineering Academy Limited in a tripartite agreement aimed at designing academic curriculum for the students of the institution which recently opened.

Registrar of the university, Alex Oladeji, said the effort was in accordance with the mission of the school to create a strong link between graduates and employment.

He said, “Under the terms of the MoU, the university NSE and AEA will work together to develop an excellent technical curriculum that will be used in the training of students at the school. The partnership will nurture exchange of ideas, networks, resources and experiences among the three parties involved in the partnership.

“With the MoU, the university, which was established to combat the growing scourge of youth unemployment, is establishing a strong link between the gown and the industry. The collaboration is the first step in bridging the gap between an average Nigerian graduate and employment. Graduates of the school will have various employment opportunities, including establishing their own businesses. They will not be limited to the Nigerian space and they will not need any form of retraining to fit into any industry. To achieve this, it is vital to partners relevant groups and agencies.”
