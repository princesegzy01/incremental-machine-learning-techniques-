FGC Ogbomoso old pupils unite against depression, suicide
Members of the Federal Government College Ogbomoso Old Students Association have expressed concern over the rising cases of depression and suicide in the country.

The old pupils, who made their feelings known during a briefing held on Tuesday in Victoria Island, Lagos to announce their forthcoming reunion, said they would discuss ways to get out of depression and avoid suicide at the event.

Speaking on what the association had in store for attending members, the Global President of the association, Mrs Yetunde Jaiyesimi, said, “We are holding our annual reunion. Every old pupil is invited to come and network, as well as thank God for how far He has led us. We shall celebrate old pupils’ successes, our teachers that molded us during our formative years, best pupils in the WASSCE and non-teaching staff.

“We shall also lend a helping hand to members who need assistance, as we award the various sets that have given back tremendously to the school. We can do all this because we have the largest old pupils’ association and we are grateful to our members for their incessant support.”

On his part, the Chairman of the End-of-Year Committee, Mr Anthony Akarah, said that with the theme, Fostering Togetherness, the association would seek to add value to national wellbeing.

“With the reunion, as always, we want to contribute our quota to national discuss. We want to address issues of depression and suicide, as well as its solutions. We are essentially seeking to add value to ourselves and by extension, the nation,” Akarah said.
