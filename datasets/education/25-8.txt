‘School curriculum should be workplace relevant’
The Chief Executive Officer of Global International College, Mrs Bolaji Osime, says the missing link between the Nigerian educational system and international standard is 21st century skills.

According to Osime, the nation’s educational curriculum is more theoretical while the 21st century skills focus on innovations and thinking.

She emphasised the need to bridge the missing link in the country’s educational system.

The GIC boss spoke during the 20th graduation of the school in Lagos, where she stressed that the current school curriculum was training students for employment with the government.

Osime said, “We cannot be training for employment with the government alone. It was the government that was employing before but now private sector is employing. In 21st century, technology has improved so many things. Government should change the current education curriculum or relate it to what employers want as a way to make our educational system relevant in the workplaces.”

She explained that GIC had been able to produce well-grounded students in the last 20 years because it focused on the goal of developing efficient leader.

According to her, the GIC has been impacting various skills like robotics and coding which are some of the things that employers want.

The chairman on the occasion, Mr Bankole Wellington (Banky W), enjoined the school-leavers to remain focused on their dreams and follow their passion.

He urged parents to support their children in the pursuit of their dreams and not to force them to live their own dreams.
