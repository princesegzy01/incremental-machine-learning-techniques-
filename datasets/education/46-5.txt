The Tertiary Education Trust Fund has urged the University of Maiduguri, Borno State, to optimally utilise the funds allocated to it to ensure efficiency in work and service delivery.

The TETFUND Executive Secretary, Prof. Suleiman Bogoro, stated this in Abuja at the fund’s headquarters while receiving a UNIMAID delegation, led by the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ibrahim Njodi,

Urging the institution to continue with its excellent performance in the utilisation of intervention funds, Bogoro said many beneficiary institutions were still struggling with accessing TETFUND support due to the accountability of their management team.

According to a statement by the fund’s Director of Public Affairs, Dr Jacob Alada, the university’s management visited TETFUND to pledge its support for Bogoro.

The statement reads, “The Executive Secretary received in his office a delegation from the University of Maiduguri, which said it is proud of his reinstatement and also being an alumnus of the university. The university added that it will continue to support him in any way possible.

“The Executive Secretary assured the Vice-Chancellor of his continued support to the university within the ambit of the law in order to ensure that the institution continue with its excellent performance in the utilisation of intervention funds.

“He commended the VC and the management team for their promptness in accessing their yearly allocations, a feat which he noted that many of the beneficiary Institutions are still struggling with.”
