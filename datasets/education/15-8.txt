Don’t post non-education graduates to schools — TRCN
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The Registrar and Chief Executive, Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria, Prof Segun Ajiboye, on Monday said it had written to National Youth Service Corp to stop posting graduates without education degrees to teach in schools.

Ajiboye lamented that most of those posted to teach in the mandatory one year scheme lacked the necessary qualification to teach.

Ajiboye noted that the education system would be bastardised when unqualified persons without requisite professional skills were sent to schools to teach.

He stated this in Ibadan, while speaking with journalists on transforming education, which is the theme of the 2019 International Youth day.

He said that majority of those teaching in private nursery and primary schools nationwide did not have the qualification to teach.

Ajiboye also emphasised that those qualified must still be registered, professionally certified and licensed by the council.

According to him, only qualified and well trained and re-trained teachers can bring about a transformed education that the Nigerian youth can benefit from.

“We have written a letter to the NYSC director-general that only those who studied education should be posted to schools during their service year. This will ensure that only round pegs are put in round holes. Why are doctors not posted to teach?”
