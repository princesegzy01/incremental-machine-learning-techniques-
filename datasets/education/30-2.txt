‘Makupedia’ll fix poor academic performance among pupils’
A creative scientist, Mr Peter Matthews-Akukalia has invented the Makupedia, a mind database also known as ‘Mind app’, that allows pupils to ascertain their true human potentials and capabilities.

According to him, the application would be a useful educational tool for brain analysis, energy processing and career pathfinding, as well as management.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Matthews-Akukalia said, “Education experts believe a nexus exists between ascertaining one’s innate potentials and academic excellence. This clearly shows why the educational systems in other climes record low rates of dropouts and poor academic performances when compared to Nigeria.

“The Mind app will begin with a registration process that will record the date of birth and other details. The Makupedia app will process the date of birth first in which the person’s dimension of existence in the universe is measured on the scope.”
