The Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti State, is set to reward selfless service to humanity by honouring exemplary personalities who have genuinely dedicated their lives in service to the nation.

According to a statement from the Vice-Chancellor’s Office, three outstanding humanists will be honoured at the second combined convocation of the university scheduled to hold between August 26 and September 1.

“The university will honour three outstanding personalities: 86-year-old Imam Abubakar Abdullahi, who saved 262 Christians that would have been killed by insurgents in northern Nigeria; the Catholic Bishop of Ekiti Diocese, Felix Ajakaiye; and American Septuagenarian, Guy Garguilo, a school principal who had dedicated over 60 years of his life to teaching and molding the destinies of young Nigerians in Akoko, Ondo State,” the statement said.

A Public Affairs analyst and professor of English at the University of Benin, Edo State, Tony Afejuku, will on August 29 deliver a public lecture titled, ‘Anticipating the Birthday Boy, Options and Possibilities for a Besieged Nation at 60’ during the convocation.

The week-long event is the second convocation of the institution and it will serve as an avenue for the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Kayode Soremekun, to showcase his achievement in providing infrastructural and learning facilities to improve FUOYE’s educational standard.
