About 40 pupils drawn from public schools in the Ikeja area of Lagos participated in Tconnect’s Pick-a-Plastic Day event, which took place last Saturday

The participants were taught the adverse effects that plastics have on the ecosystem. They were also urged to contribute their quotas to the attainment of the sixth Societal Development Goal, which borders on clean water and sanitation for all.

The pupils were mentored by Tconnect’s SDG ambassadors, Derin Oyenuga and Gbenga Thomas, who spoke on the importance of the goals and the role that each of the pupils, aged between 13 and 18, had to play to be fully involved in making the world a better place.

Speaking on Tconnect, its coordinator, Mr Israel Onasanwo, said the company’s vision was to raise and equip children to become global citizens with core values based on love, integrity and passion for service to humanity.

His words, “Our mission is to engage one child at a time through events and activities that will shape them into global citizens. This passion of Tconnect has led the organisation to enrol 15 of these children in a leadership academy on a scholarship sponsored by Daystar Christian Center.

“We also created a book review club where successful individuals review the books with them and inspire them. We have also established a football club and a homemakers club for the teenagers,” Onasanwo said.
