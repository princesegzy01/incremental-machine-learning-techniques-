Proprietor laments high cost of textbooks, teaching materials
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Proprietor of Greater Tomorrow Group of Schools, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, Ademola Owaraye, has lamented the high cost of textbooks and teaching materials for primary and secondary school pupils in the state.

Owaraye, who described quality textbooks as indispensable in giving sound education to pupils, said the rising cost of such books had forced parents to pay more for the education of their wards.

Speaking in Ado Ekiti, he said,“ We facing the challenge of paying more money for textbooks and teaching materials. Publishers increase the prices of textbooks every term or session. In Greater Tomorrow, we can’t do without textbooks”.

Owaraye also identified challenges facing private primary and secondary schools to include government policies, which he said might not be favourable to parents, in terms of excessive charges, levies and tax.

Explaining why parents have continued to patronise private schools, he said, “They want qualitative education and they want where their children will be given the best academically so that they will be able to compete anywhere in the society.

“Apart from that, parents want security for their children, where they will be taken care of in terms of security, social and other areas.

“Competitiveness has continued to bring out the best in private secondary schools. Nobody will establish a business and not be keen on competition. Everybody will try as much as possible to do things that will make his establishment to be reckoned with in society.”
