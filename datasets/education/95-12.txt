For Adepoju, time is ripe for Budding Lily
Akeem Lasisi

All is now set for the presentation of Budding Lily, a novel by Atinuke Adepoju, an entrepreneur who works with a bank.

The book published by Boox Bransador will be presented today (Tuesday) at the Kind Secretariat, Opebi, Ikeja, Lagos.

Budding Lily narrates the story of a young couple in the heart of Lagos, faced with childlessness and domestic violence in a society that lays emphasis on fertility.

Adepoju notes that the story of Lillian Badmus – the heroine of the novel – is not hers, but she was naturally inspired to write about domestic violence.

“I was inspired by God,” she says. “It is not from any personal experience; after all, I am not even married. I just ended up with the storyline.”

She adds that by 2011 when she started working on Budding Lily, she set it out as a short story. A friend, however, advised her to enlarge it, having read and observed its potential. The author was then in the final year at the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko, where she obtained a degree in English Studies.

By 2013, she had finished work on the manuscript. She later uploaded the work on a platform online. According to her, the response she got from readers really encouraged her to publish the book.

The coast became clearer for Adepoju when, in recent years, more people began to talk about domestic violence.
