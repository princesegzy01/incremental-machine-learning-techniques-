The Provost, Lagos State College of Nursing, Midwifery and Public Health Nursing, Igando, Mrs Oyefunso Orenuga, has charged the graduands of the college to be patriotic and be of good behaviour.

Orenuga, during the 2nd graduation ceremony of the college on Thursday, noted that attitude, integrity, contentment, hard work and godliness are qualities needed by the graduands to succeed in their profession.

She said, “Patriotism should start with the question of what can I give back to the institution that trained me, as well as the State that spent so much to train me?”

The Provost added that the available statistics which reveals that the world would need 800,000 nurses by the year 2025 provides a hedge for the graduands for employment opportunities either in private or government setting.

The Special Adviser on Education to the Lagos State governor, Mr Tokunbo Wahab, enjoined the graduands to be worthy ambassadors of the college, stressing the importance the administration of Babajide Sanwo-Olu placed on health care delivery as shown in the Governor’s T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda.

Wahab who was represented by a Director in the Office of the Special Adviser on Education, Mrs Funmilola Olajide, pledged the administration’s commitment to providing necessary infrastructure and personnel that will transform the institution into a full-fledged College.
