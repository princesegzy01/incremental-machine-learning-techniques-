A Professor of Industrial Chemistry at the Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Kolawole Ajanaku, has advocated the recycling of some selected waste materials with the aim of transforming them into valuable materials.

Ajanaku said this while delivering the 21st inaugural lecture of the university on Friday, titled, ‘Solid Waste Revolution: The Artificial Intelligence Towards Smart, Sustainable and Safe Cities.’

“Considering the valuable resources coming out of waste materials from most of our daily activities, it has become very imperative for us to agree on the terms of tackling the waste management challenge.

“Individuals, communities and the government need to come to terms with the problems and provide solutions in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

“There is also a need to imbibe the 3Rs approach of Reduce, Reuse and Recycling of wastes as a means of sustainable drive. Let there be a waste transfer station in every state in Nigeria.

“Also, let there be appropriate and applicable approach by the government in getting rid of the solid waste instead of the dumping in landfill approach currently in place,” he added.
