Redeemer’s varsity matriculates 703
The Redeemer’s University, Ede, Osun State, recently matriculated 703 students who the institution’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Anthony Akinlo, advised to be strong in order to overcome the challenges of life.

This was made known in a statement signed by the university’s Director of Corporate Affairs, Adetunji Adeleye.

At the ceremony, held on the university campus, Akilo said, “Hardness is required to weather the challenges of life, reach your goal and fulfill your God-given mandate. You must also maintain your polish wherever you find yourself. Don’t be lost in the crowd, but be the change agent. Furthermore, God expects you to be precious so that you will add value wherever you find yourself.”

Akinlo further admonished the new students not to be contaminated by things that could take away their value as diamonds. He appealed to parents not to leave the training of their young ones to the university alone as they had a part to play in the nurturing of their young minds. “Join hands with the university to ensure that these young ones have all-around training so that they will be found worthy in character and learning to excel in all aspects of life,” he said.
