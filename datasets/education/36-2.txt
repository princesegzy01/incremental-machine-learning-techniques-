Mubi poly warns students against cultism
Hindi Livinus, Yola

The Federal Polytechnic Mubi, Adamawa State, has held an anti-cultism induction and orientation workshop for the 1,595 students of the institution.

At the orientation tagged, ‘Anti-cultism and Drug-free Re-Orientation Campaign Workshop,’ students were given tips on being successful academically and coping with peer pressure that could predispose them to drug abuse and cultism.

The Rector of the polytechnic, Dr Sadiq Yahya, urged the matriculated students to shun cultism, saying it could breed violent behaviours that predisposed its adherent to crime, as well as distracted them from their studies.

Yahya, who was represented by the Deputy Rector, Administration, Dr Isiaka Abdulrahman, said the institution had zero tolerance for cultism and anyone caught being a cultist would be expelled.

He said, “When young persons are advised to shun cultism; we are only saying ‘take a stand and act with your future in mind’. It is not just cultism that young persons must stand against; they must also take a stand to live drug-free lives.”

The coordinator of the workshop, who is also the Dean of the School of Science, Dr Gabriel Yusuf, said the re-orientation was the institution’s way of curbing the menace of drug abuse and cult-related activities among its student population.
