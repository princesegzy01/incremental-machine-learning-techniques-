Physical activity critical for pupils’ mental development —Principal
The Principal of Krisbethel College, Ipaja, Lagos, Mr Adetiba Ojo, has said that physical activity plays a critical role in the mental and physical development of a child.

Ojo stated this on Wednesday during the school’s Inter-House Sports Competition, where he also urged pupils to engage in cognitive, psychomotor and affirmative activities to become grounded.

He explained that physical activities help pupils to become mentally alert in the classroom, enhance their spirit of sportsmanship and improve their general physical well-being.

Ojo said, “The impact of events like this is that mental alertness is increased and the academic performances of pupils always improve. If a pupil is not physically fit, there is always a limit to what he can do in the classroom. So, emphasis should be placed on sporting activities as it also positively affects the moral intelligence of a child.

“If a child is academically sound but morally bankrupt, he or she cannot go anywhere. When you are academically sound and you are not physically fit, it is a problem also. Parents should endeavour to allow their children to participate in sporting activities.”

The Executive Director of the college, Mrs Cline Olusoji, also said the school was committed to developing the talents of its pupils through sporting activities.

Cline said, “Children have different talents, some are academically-inclined, some are better in sports and some can do the two together. What we are trying to do is to harness the sporting talent in them so they can be the best at what they are good at.”
