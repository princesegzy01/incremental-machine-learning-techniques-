Tech-U renamed First Technical University
Chux Ohai

The Technical University, Ibadan, Oyo State, has been renamed First Technical University, following the passage into law of a recent amendment to the 2012 Law setting up the institution.

The change of name was made known in a statement issued by the management of the university through its spokesperson, Mr. Femi Babatunde, and made available to our correspondent on Monday.

According to the statement, the amendment, however, does not in anyway affect the current status of the university as a wholly public-owned university.

The statement partly reads, “Being Nigeria’s pioneer technical university, the addition of the word ‘First’ to the former rendering of the name is deemed necessary to reassert the unique leadership position of the institution in the nation’s tertiary education space and beyond.

“Also, the recent amendment provides legal authority for Tech-U to receive grants and to enter into partnerships with public or private sources, other than the Oyo State Government. Consequently, Tech-U may now solicit and invite private partners to invest in the university, its programmes and objectives.

“The Tech-U management wishes to emphatically state and reassure all and sundry that the said name-change shall not compromise its avowed commitment to running a unique university committed to producing relevant researches and nurturing graduates equipped with adequate technical skills for societal transformation.

“Prospective investors are therefore free to approach the university management wherever they are willing to come in.”
