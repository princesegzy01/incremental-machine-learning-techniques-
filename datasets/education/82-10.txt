Old pupils rebuild school gate with N10m
Olufemi Atoyebi, Ibadan

As part of the 110th anniversary of their alma mater, members of the Abeokuta Grammar School Old Boys Association, Club 816, have rebuilt the main gate of the school and replaced the old structures in the school premises with modern ones at the cost of N10m.

President of the 1981-86 set, Otunba Gbolahan Aigoro, who disclosed this to our correspondent in Ibadan on Thursday, said the project was chosen because of what an entry point to a school symbolised.

Aigoro said that members of the set, including those in the Diaspora, contributed the money to execute the project.

Stressing that the idea was the old pupils, own way of giving back to the institution that nurtured them, he said, “The gate is ultra-modern in standard. You can compare it to any of the ones standing at the entrance of some of our big universities. We placed emphasis on rebuilding the gate because of what it stands for. It is the first thing a new pupil will see and it has great significance on the image of the school.

“We enjoyed some goodwill from the pupils who looked back and gave something to the school while we were studying there. We believe that such a gesture must continue. The Public Relations Officer of the set, Olasehu Adebayo, members of the executive committee and other members of the set committed their time, energy and financial resources to ensuring that the project was completed within a time frame.”

Aigoro added that the set’s next project was the replacement of furniture in some of the classrooms and staff rooms in the school.
