The 1973-78 set of the Ex-Boys of the Nigerian Military School, Zaria, have commended the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin, for the sense of professionalism with which he has been conducting the affairs of the Nigerian Armed Forces.

The ex-boys made this known during the first award ceremony of the association held at the Nigerian Army Officers Mess, in Asokoro, Abuja, recently.

In his address, the Chairman of the association, Major-Gen. Adedapo Adedayo, described Olonisakin as an epitome of professionalism who had distinguished himself above all other service chiefs in recent times.

Adedayo, who is the immediate past commander of the Nigerian Army Education Corps, urged Olonisakin to “give priority to the internal security of the country, especially as the country is preparing for the general elections.”

He also thanked Olonisakin for the candid attention that he had always given to the association.

The Chairman of the occasion, Air Vice-Marshal John Odeh (retd.), also commended Olonisakin and urged him not to relent in his efforts “till the mayhem that has been rocking the country becomes a thing of the past.”

While advising the awardees to be objective in whatever they do or say, Olonisakin, who is a member of The Elites, said he was pleased to identify with the set. “Today, I am so happy to belong to this fortunate set which has produced a reasonable number of generals and its equivalent in the armed forces,” he said.

The ceremony had Major-Gen. Simeon Oni, Major-Gen. Sam Olasubikan, Brigadier-Gen. Sofoluwe, Brigadier-Gen. Funsho Oyeneyin, Col. E. A. Okorho and teachers of the set in attendance.
