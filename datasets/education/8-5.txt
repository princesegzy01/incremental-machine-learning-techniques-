The Proprietress of Pinefield Schools, Lagos, Mrs Moralayo Fadipe, has said that emphasis on virtue-based learning will go a long way in revving the falling standards of education in the country.

Fadipe, during the 20th anniversary of the school held in Lagos recently, said the school had over the years instilled the fear of God in its pupils and it exhibited a passion contributions to the development of the education sector in Nigeria.

She said, “Christian educators should bring Christ into the classroom. Schools business is God’s business and he is the creator of all subjects. The change we need in our country cannot come from us, but it is coming from the new generation of godly leaders who will detest corruption and poor leadership.

“For 20 years we have used grace and courtesy to develop positive characters in our pupils. There is the need to encourage virtue-based learning in our schools across the country. This will help in reviving the falling standards of education. Nigeria must be great and must stand out among its contemporaries.”

Fadipe added that the school has impacted pupils who have passed through the school in the last 20 years as the majority of them are doing well in their chosen career. She added that a total of 905 pupils have passed through the school in the 20 years of its experience.
