UNICEF, YBR sign MoU on primary education funding

The United Nations Children’s Fund has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a marketing communications agency, Yellow Brick Road, on the Every Child in School campaign.

The campaign, the duo said, would mobilise Nigerian youths to become advocates for poor children and call on the government to commit more money to primary education in the 2019 budget.

This was made known in a statement by the Director of Strategy for YBR, Ms Nnenna Onyewuchi, who said that the campaign would primarily be aimed that reducing the number of out-of-school children in the country.

Her words, “Research reveals that more than 10 million primary school age children in Nigeria do not attend school. That number makes Nigeria number one in sub-Saharan Africa – and the world – for the number of out-of-school children. The vast majority of these children are out of school because their families cannot afford to send them to school. Although the Nigerian government passed the Universal Basic Education Act in 2004, under-investment and uneven implementation have left millions of children without access to adequate primary education.
