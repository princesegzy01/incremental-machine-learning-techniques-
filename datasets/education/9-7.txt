The Management of the Federal Polytechnic,Ukana, Essien Udium Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, has denied an online vacancy and job placement advertorial and called on members of the public to ignore it.

It said the institution did not declare vacant positions in any platform and it was not planning to conduct any recruitment exercise.

The Registrar of the Polytechnic, Dr.Okon Ekanem, in a disclaimer published and signed by him on Wednesday, warned that the Institution would not take responsibility for anybody duped by fraudsters using the Internet as a medium.

The statement advised admission seekers not to register online but to come to the main campus of the polytechnic for registration.

The statement reads in part, “The general public is hereby informed that the advertised recruitment did not emanate from the Federal Polytechnic, Ukana and should be ignored.

“More so, candidates seeking admission into the polytechnic are strongly advised not to register online as registration is done on the polytechnic campus only.

“The polytechnic shall not take any responsibility for those who are duped by fraudsters using the Internet as a medium”

Sources within the polytechnic claimed that many people had lost various sums of money to fraudsters offering fake employment or admission to tertiary institutions online.

One of such victims, Idorenyin Samuel, said she was duped of N200,000 through an online website.

She said that she was promised a job at the institution only to discover that she was scammed.
