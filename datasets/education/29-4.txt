Adekunle Peter, Benin

A group, Benin Indigenous People Assembly, has urged Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, to reconsider actions that led to the closure of some state-owned tertiary institutions in the state.

The group, stated this in a statement signed by its Chairman and Secretary-General, Board of Trustee, Dr West Idahosa and Hon Orobosa Omo-Ojo.

The group noted that education, which used to be the biggest industry of the people of Edo South Senatorial District had been totally abandoned for 11 years.

Recall that the state government, last year, shut down the College of Education, Ekiadolor, following its conversion to Tayo Akpata University of Education by the Adams Oshiomhole administration. Other institutions shut down by the then state government include the College of Agriculture, Iguoriakhi and Edo State School of Nursing.

“As a group, we have noticed with concern the systematic abandonment of the specialist training and teaching institutions in Edo South, especially the College of Education, Ekiadolor and the College of Agriculture, Iguorakhi,” the statement read in part.

The group, however, pledged to ensure that the welfare, security and interests of all people were guaranteed through good governance at the state and national level.
