The old girls of Fiwasaye Anglican Girls’ Grammar School in Akure, Ondo State, have held a national convention in commemoration of the school’s 60th anniversary.

The two-day convention which took place in Lagos on Friday, also featured a fundraising dinner with the theme, ‘Giving Back for Global Impact’.

According to a statement released by the Lagos Branch of Fiwasaye Old Girls Association, the convention was to prepare for the symbolic diamond jubilee of the school.

A member of the association, Tayo Daramola, said the convention was significant because it was a way to pay-back the school that shaped the old girls. “We intend to make the school more conducive for the pupils, even better than what we had. By raising funds for the school through the goodwill of family, friends and associates, we will be complementing what the government and other agencies are doing.”

Daramola also said the convention provided an opportunity for the reunion of sisters and friends, which included women for all aspects of the economy. “The ladies who passed through the school were built on a solid foundation by committed, God-fearing and disciplined principals and staff such as Ms Pelly, Sheila Davis, and several others.”
