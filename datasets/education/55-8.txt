Education critical to development in any society – Balogun
The Founder of the First City Monument Bank Plc, Dr Olasubomi Balogun, has described education as one of the critical drivers of development in any society.

Balogun, who was represented by the Group Chief Executive Officer of the bank, Mr Ladi Balogun, said this at the University of Ibadan’s 70th Anniversary Life Achievement and Honours Awards Night held recently on the university’s main campus in Ibadan, Oyo State.

Balogun also called on well-meaning Nigerians and organisations to support the development and growth of education in the country with their resources. “It is incumbent on those of us that have been blessed with education, particularly higher education, to continue to give back, especially to those institutions that shaped us. Education can never be entirely funded by the government or private fees.”

He said many of the greatest institutions in the world had endowments running into millions of dollars and it has enabled them to fund research and build tomorrow’s leaders, innovators and change agents.

While delivering a paper titled, ‘Higher Education and Philanthropy’ Balogun said, “Education has the capacity to stimulate a high sense of philanthropy in any individual who has benefitted from it. I would also add that supporting education is one of the most effective means one can contribute to the betterment of society.”
