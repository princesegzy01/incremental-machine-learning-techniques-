A non-governmental organisation, Beyond School Walls Initiative, has urged parents to help teenagers to be skillful and productive by encouraging and engaging them with productive activities.

The advice was given at an interactive session organised by the NGO at the hall of St. Theresa College Nsukka, Enugu state.

The theme of the interactive session held in partnership with the Enugu State Post Primary School Management Board was, ‘Challenges Facing 21st Century Teenagers As Well As Inspiring Young Minds’.

According to a statement, the founder of the NGO, Engr Ujunwa Odinkonigbo, said the event aimed to help set up a road map to change the educational, morals and values landscape in society.

He said, “In inspiring young minds, parents and other stakeholders must be on the same page by ensuring that these pupils are engaged with meaningful activities during their free periods.

“Cultism, abuse of Information and Communication Technology, materialism and get rich syndrome, peer pressure, depression and suicidal tendencies, and many more have been identified as the basic challenges and monumental endemic that has eaten deep into the fabric of the society, thus, affecting average teenagers.”

The General Manager of Solid FM, Dr. Pat Ndu, advised the pupils to avoid suicide and leave everything in the hands of God. She enjoined the pupils to persevere and struggle to attain greater heights.
