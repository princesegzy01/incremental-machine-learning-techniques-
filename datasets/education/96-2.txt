The Director of Academic and Planning, University of Lagos, Mr. Wale Okunuga, has described the forthcoming University of Lagos Research Conference and Fair as an initiative that will benefit small and medium scale industries.

He said this at a briefing held recently at the Senate Building of the institution in Akoka, Lagos.

Okunuga said, “Our drive is to reach out to industries and the SME groups in order to make them see how they could improve what they are currently doing. As a result of the vision of the vice-chancellor, we want to take our research outside the walls of the institute and sell what we have to the public.

“Most times, the industries want to stay where they are and likewise, the university. This has not helped the situation. This time around, we want to reach out to as many industries that are willing to partner with us for this particular conference.”

The Conference Planning Committee will hold its 13th Annual Research Conference and Fair between August 28 and 30 at the Jelili Omotola Hall on the university campus.

The conference themed, Resource Utilisation and Sustainable Development, will include the keynote and plenary lectures by invited speakers. The sub-themes will cover Future cities and Environmental sustainability, E-learning, Emerging Technologies and Robotics and Legal Issues in Resource Utilisation, among others.

During the briefing, the Chairman of the Conference Planning Committee, Prof. Abayomi Okanlawon, stated that that another aim of the conference was to rub minds and to bring the town and gown together.
