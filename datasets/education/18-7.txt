Graduates of Greensprings School’s International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme have surpassed the world average in 12 subjects in the IB Diploma examination.

According to statistics released by the International Baccalaureate Organisation, in the May 2019 IBDP examination, the average scores of the students exceeded that of the 1,214 schools in 94 countries that did the examination.

Speaking on the statistics, the IB Diploma Coordinator of the school, Mr Abidemi Arimoro, said he was thrilled by the feat achieved by the students which was proof that, “if given quality education, Nigerian students could compete with their counterparts anywhere in the world. The students showed a lot of determination and put in a great deal of work. Therefore, all of their achievements are well-deserved.”

The subjects in which the students beat the world average are English Language, Literature, Mathematics, Biology, Computer Science, Business Management and Psychology.

The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme is a post-secondary school programme designed to prepare students for life in tertiary institutions.

Students admitted into the programme are expected to have a minimum of five credits in their O’ Levels including English Language and Mathematics.
