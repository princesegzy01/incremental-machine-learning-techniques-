AdelaniAdepegba, Abuja

An education conference has recommended an inclusive curriculum to enable all children in the country learn and reach their potential.

The Connecting Classrooms International Inclusive Education Conference, organised by the British Council in Abuja, pointed out that the inclusive curriculum must involve representatives of all members of the society and should be supported by legislation and national policy.

In his presentation at the event, a Senior Education Consultant with the University of Westminster, David Crabtree, noted that the inclusive curriculum must take cognisance of learnersâ€™ ability, age, differentiation according to need.

Crabtree argued that an inclusive curriculum would address poverty, social exclusion, gender access and attitudes, stressing that it would lead to successful participation in education of groups traditionally excluded.
