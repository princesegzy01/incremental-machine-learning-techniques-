Edo taxes contractors on schools’ renovation
Adekunle Peter, Benin

Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has asked contractors handling the renovation of schools in the state to ensure they do a thorough job or risk prosecution.

Obaseki made this known in a meeting with the contractors in Benin on Monday where he said a team had been set up to monitor the refurbishment of schools.

He said, “Ordinary, I will not interact with contractors but because of the priority we place on basic education, I decided to have this all-important meeting with you. We have five pillars of our SUBEB system and one of them is the refurbishment of our schools.

“To fix basic education, you need to look at all the aspects; the training of teachers, review of the curriculum and refurbishment of the physical environment of the schools. We want you to understand that you are a part of our efforts at rebuilding our basic education system, thus, you must deliver on the job as specified. We are taking the process seriously and anybody that does not perform as expected will be in trouble,” Obaseki warned.

He urged the contractors to fast-track the delivery of the jobs, so they could bid for the additional 230 schools.
