No fewer than 60 private secondary schools in Nigeria are set to compete for N1.5m at the first sports competition for solely private secondary schools.

The competition, Private School Games 2018, billed for November 29 to December 2, is the brain child of School Games Limited, in partnership with the Association of Private Educatorss.

To be held at Teslim Balogun Stadium and University of Lagos Sports Complex, the pupils will compete in football, basketball, volleyball, handball,

lawn tennis, swimming, boxing, fencing, as well as track and field events.

Speaking on the aim of the competition, CEO and Founder, Private School Games Initiative, Mr. Adeyemi Egbeoluwa said, “I have come to realise that sports competitions are key to all round development and growth of children. It is important to quantify, identify and aggregate the total contribution of private school talents to the pool of young and emerging sportsmen and women in the country.”

Explaining why the competition is targeted at only private schools, Egbeoluwa, said, “While the public school sector has various initiatives sponsored by government, these opportunities are few and far between for private schools. School Games Limited is determined to fill this void by organising a worldclass multi-sport competition and market it as a platform where talented private secondary school students can be identified, developed and nurtured.”
