ICYMI: 77-year-old woman graduates from UNILAG
A 77-year-old female retired worker was among the 1,008 students of the Faculty of Education, University of Lagos, who were awarded a first degree on Tuesday at the institution’s 2017/2018 Convocation Ceremonies.

The convocation was the university’s 50th.

The retiree, Mrs Bridget Okonji of the Department of Educational Foundations (Guidance Counselling), told journalists that the achievement was her dream come true.

“I studied guidance and counselling and I am most grateful to God Almighty who made me see this day.

“I am a retired officer. I have worked in a lot of countries around the world and also in Nigeria, where I finally retired,’’ Okonji, with Matriculation Number 111305030, said.

She added that she went for the degree programme because she did not want to sit at home after retirement.

“You know when you retire like that, you will not want to stay at home and be dying slowly, she said.

According to the retiree, no one should feel too old to go to school as learning remains a life-long adventure.

“Education has no limit. It is from cradle to death in order for one to add value to the society,’’ she said.
