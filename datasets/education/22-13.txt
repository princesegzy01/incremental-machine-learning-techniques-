Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin

The Kwara State Government has approved the sum of N250m for six colleges of education and schools of nursing for the payment of two months’ outstanding salaries, at least, and for re-accreditation of courses in the institutions.

Governor Abdulrahman AbdulRazaq made this known in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, on Friday.

The governor also disclosed that N49. 8m was approved for the Kwara State College of Education (Technical), Lafiagi and College of Arabic and Islamic Legal Studies, Ilorin to process accreditation for courses in both institutions.

The staff of the tertiary institutions had embarked on industrial action on April 2019 to press for payment of salary arrears owed them by the immediate past administration in the state.

The statement reads in part, “The total amount the governor released for payment of salaries is 250,774, 328.34. This covers the salaries for the months of May and June. Concerned about the status of the schools, the governor also approved an additional N25m for the College of Education Technical Lafiagi for immediate re-accreditation and N24.8m for CAILS for re-accreditation.”

According to the statement, AbdulRazaq also gave the assurance that salaries would be promptly paid to workers in the state, while his administration would undertake a gradual payment of the salary arrears inherited from the previous administration under which the schools embarked on the strike.
