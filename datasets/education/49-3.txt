We didn’t pass bill for take-off of Islamic varsity – Imo lawmakers
Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

The Imo State House of Assembly on Sunday said it did not pass any bill for the establishment of an Islamic university.

The lawmakers, however, said they passed bills for the establishment of Chosen University and Bishop Shanahan Polytechnic.

In a statement issued in Owerri, the state capital and signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Speaker, Marcel Ekwezuo, the legislators stated that the legislature passed a bill into law to establish schools of nursing and midwifery owned by faith-based organisations and other private establishments in the state.

The statement read in part, “The decision of the House to pass the bill for establishing schools of nursing and midwifery owned by faith-based organisations and other private establishments in Imo State was because the House had earlier passed into law a similar bill to establish Imo Catholic School of Nursing and Midwifery, which gave rise to various churches or Christian denominations seeking approval for government recognition for their schools of nursing and midwifery.”

“In view of the multiplicity of churches, therefore, the constitutional right of freedom of religion and worship, the House decided to make a single law that can accommodate all other Christian faith-based institutions for the establishment of their schools of nursing and midwifery once they met the stipulated criteria instead of making one law for each Christian faith-based school of nursing and midwifery each time they come.”
