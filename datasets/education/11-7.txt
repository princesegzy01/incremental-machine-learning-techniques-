The union was said to have held a meeting with the state Special Adviser on Education, Tokunbo Wahab, during which the dispute was resolved.

A statement on Monday by the Public Affairs Officer, Office of the Special Adviser on Education, Omolase Yejide, confirmed the development.

The statement said, “The peace meeting held at the office of the Special Adviser to the Governor on Education, Barrister Tokunbo Wahab, on Monday, August 30.

“A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Lagos State Government, the college management and the union executives on a way to proffer lasting solution to the lingering crisis in the college.

“The union thereafter resolved to suspend its nine day industrial action, instructing all its members to resume at their duty post immediately and all parties should adhere to the signed agreement.”

The statement noted that the union commended the Lagos State Government for intervening in the crisis.

Wahab was quoted to have advised all the parties to toe the path of peace for the progress of the college.
