the Managing Director, Amtis Skills Place, Mrs Adebusola Omotunde, has advocated for the adjustment of primary and secondary school curricula in the country to give room for skill-based learning.

Omotunde said this on Thursday at a Make-up Competition organised by her firm in partnership with Zaron Cosmetics for selected secondary school pupils in Lagos and Ogun States. The schools which participated in the competition were; Greensprings School, Anthony, Lagos, Rainbow College, Maba, Ogun State and Rainbow College, Surulere.

The competition, held at Greensprings School, Anthony, Lagos, was themed, ‘It is in you.’

“The whole idea for us is to promote skills-based education, putting skills at par with regular profession, such as Law, Engineering and the likes. We just want to ignite children’s interest in hands-on skills by using makeup as a medium.

“There is a need to adjust our curriculum and if possible, do a bit of overhauling to make room for skills-based learning. I believe that the way forward is to encourage pupils to get involved in entrepreneurship.

“A few years ago, some parents could not conceive the idea of their children earning a living as fashion designers or makeup artists. Today we have seen that it is no longer business as usual in these fields. Enough of graduates finishing schools and not getting jobs,” Omotunde said.

Greensprings School, Anthony, Lagos won in the competition in the makeup category, while Rainbow College, Maba, Ogun State won the headgear contest.
