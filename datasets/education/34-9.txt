The Council Chairman of the National Open University of Nigeria, Prof. Peter Okebukola, has been selected by the Director-General of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, Audrey Azoulay, to serve on the jury of the UNESCO Kalinga Prize for the Popularisation of Science from 2019 to 2022.

This was contained in a letter addressed to Okebukola by UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for Natural Sciences, Shamila Nair-Bedouelle.

The letter read in part, “On behalf of the Director-General, it is my pleasure to invite you to serve on the jury of the UNESCO Kalinga Prize for the Popularisation of Science for the period from 2019 to 2022.

“Created in 1950, the prize rewards, every two years, the outstanding efforts of a person who has led a distinguished career as a writer, editor, lecturer, radio/television programme director or film producer, and who has popularised science, research and technology for the general public.

“Our intention is to hold the next UNESCO Kalinga Prize award ceremony on the occasion of the World Science Forum, which will take place in Budapest, Hungary, from November 20 to 23, 2019.”

Also, the Programme Specialist, Division for Science Policy and Capacity Building, UNESCO, Mr Yoslan Nur, in a statement said Okebukola was the first African to win the prize in 1992.
