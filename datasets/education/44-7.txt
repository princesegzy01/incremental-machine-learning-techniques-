The Universal Basic Education Commission has set aside N110m from the 2019 executive budget proposal of the commission as grants for 22 Mahad/Islamiyya schools nationwide.

According to the commission, the grant, which will give N5m to each Islamic school, was for the provision of infrastructures, including classrooms, toilets and boreholes.

Our correspondent gathered that 20 UBEC officials would be sent to verify the schools before the grants would be released and each UBEC official would receive N250,000 for the exercise.

The budget proposal said there would be first and second monitoring of the Islamic schools after the disbursements.

It added that the 20 UBEC officials participating in the monitoring would be given a total of N10m for the exercise.

The budget partly reads, “ERGP23132198 — Provision of grants to 22 existing Mahad/Islamiyya schools at N5,000,000 each to improve their infrastructures; classrooms, rehabilitation, toilets, boreholes, etc, at N110m.
