ASUSS lauds Fayemi over new schools
Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Academic Staff Union of Secondary Schools has commended the Ekiti State Government for establishing four additional secondary schools in the state capital.

The Chairman of ASUSS, Mr Sola Adigun and Secretary, Mr Abiodun Ogunkuade, said the step was evidence of Governor Kayode Fayemi’s commitment to improving access to education in the state.

In a statement on Thursday, the ASUSS leaders said, “This is the first major intervention of the government in increasing the available space in secondary schools for pupils to gain admission in the last 20 years. Also, the naming of the new schools after eminent Ekiti persons would awaken the sense of patriotism and integrity in young people.”

The union added that virtually all the secondary schools in the state capital had gone over 70 per cent beyond their carrying capacity, a development which it said reduced class control and learning.

ASUSS also appealed to the government to take a critical look at teaching materials and manpower in the existing schools, particularly the provision and updating of science laboratories and Information and Communication Technology centres.

The new schools are Banji Akintoye Comprehensive High School, Federal Poly Road; Ayo Fasanmi Comprehensive High School along EKSU/Iworoko Road; Deji Fasuan Comprehensive High School along Old Iyin Road; and David Oke Comprehensive High School along Ikere Road.
