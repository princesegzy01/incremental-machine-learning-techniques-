Don blames govt takeover for cultism, drug abuse in schools
Femi Makinde, Osogbo

A Professor of History and International Relations at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Richard Olaniyan, has said that the prevalence of cultism, drug abuse and other social vices in secondary schools across the country is due to the decision by government to take over the schools from missionary organisations.

Olaniyan said this during a lecture organised to mark the 25th anniversary of Our Lady and St. Francis Catholic College in Osogbo, Osun State on Thursday.

He said that moral values and virtues disappeared from the schools after the government took over from the missionaries.

Olaniyan said, “The education sector has not been the same again. The quality of education has suffered a terrible decline and the effect is still very much with us. The tragedy is that individuals lost the capacity for contributing to the attainment of the common good.

“As a result, civic values and civic consciousness are constantly being eroded among the youths today, thereby causing them to engage in violence, drugs, excessive drinking, criminality of all kinds and sexual immortality.

“The problem with youths who engage in such anti-social behaviors is that they choose to enjoy freedom that is not anchored on moral and Christian principles such as honesty, freedom, justice, human rights and responsibilities.”
