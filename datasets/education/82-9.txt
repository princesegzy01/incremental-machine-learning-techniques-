The founder of Dabitos Schools, Mrs Adenike Osindero, has called on government at all levels to show more support for private education in Nigeria.

She spoke at the Dabitos Schools 2018 graduation ceremony held on Wednesday in Lagos, urging the government to treat the private schools as partners. Osindero said, “More efforts last are needed by the government in order to better the facilities in public schools but, private schools need to be treated more as partners.

“The government thinks that we are making a lot of money, whereas we actually render services to the government; graduates nowadays roam the streets looking for jobs, whereas private schools have been trying to employ a lot of them.”

On the levies being imposed on the private schools, the founder said, “The levies we are being asked to pay are just too much; they would ask us to pay for television, radio, safety commission and land use. We are appealing to government to look into these frivolous charges imposed on us.”

In her opening address, she advised the graduates to use what they had acquired to better lives in the world.

“Be good ambassadors of Dabitos, be the best you can be as you start another journey in life. We will not relent in moulding lives for a better society,” she said.

Osindero further noted that parents should train their children well in order to surmount life’s hurdles and the disastrous effects of technology in the world.
