UNICAL accused of bias against medical lab students
Olufemi Atoyebi, Abuja

The Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists of Nigeria on Monday said that pathologists at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Calabar, Cross Rivers State, denied medical laboratory students the use of the institution’s laboratory for training, claiming that the Chief Medical Director of the facility, Prof Ikpeme Asanye, and chairman of the Medical and Advisory Committee, Prof Ogbu Ngim, were responsible for the refusal.

Speaking at a briefing held in Abuja, the National Publicity Secretary of the association, Casmir Cajetan, said the management of the teaching hospital had also resorted to molesting medical laboratory scientists in the institution. He described the act as a disruption of the peace and routine health care activities in the hospital.

According to him, the pathologists on September 5, 2019, ordered the workers and students on medical laboratory training out of the laboratories in the institution, locked up the facilities and deployed armed men to guard the gates.

He said, “Fracas ensued when the students on training, who were denied access to the laboratories, noticed that their counterparts, who are students of medicines from UNICAL and who did not possess identification cards, were granted access to the laboratories.

“A number of our members, including two nursing mothers who were arrested and held in police detention on the order of the CMD, were denied bail.”
