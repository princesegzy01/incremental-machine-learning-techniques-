Digital learning’ll end mass failure – Salami

The Chief Executive Officer of Save-A-Lot Media Limited, Mr Akeem Salami, has said access to digital learning is one of the ways to tackle mass failure among pupils in the country.

Salami said this on Wednesday in Lagos at the unveiling of an audio-visual classroom app, eduvolution, designed to help pupils.

He said, “The fastest way to address mass failure is to embrace flexible means of learning, where pupils would have the opportunity to listen to a classroom-based lecture on a specific topic as many times as possible at their own convenient time using any mobile device.

“Nigerian pupils are expected to compete with their counterparts around the world; yet, they have limited access to the facilities that improve learning in other parts of the world.”

The legislator representing Eti-Osa Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Ibrahim Obanikoro, also said online learning which had been embraced all over the world would aid learning in the country.

“This is the right direction to go because everywhere you go in the world; they have moved their classrooms online. Majority of schools in the world now offer online classes and examination. It is appropriate to get our students used to this method of learning,” Obanikoro said.
