Wellsprings’ Odukomaiya rewarded over 2017 WASSCE
A former pupil of Wellsprings College, Lagos, Oluwademilade Odukomaiya, has received an award from Sidmach Technologies for emerging third best candidate in the 2017 West African Senior School Certificate Examination held in Lagos State.

Odukomaiya was presented with a laptop computer, free Internet data for six months and a certificate of excellence during the IT Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Lagos chapter of the Nigeria Computer Society held recently.

Now studying mechanical engineering at the Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, Odukomaiya attributed his success in the examination to God and hard work. He said “God helped me to work hard, pay attention in class and study adequately to prepare for the examination. Also, I thank the principal of Wellspring College and all my teachers who taught and guided me throughout my stay in the school.”

Proud of the former pupil’s achievement, the Principal of the college, Mrs Oluwayemisi Oloriade, said the school’s culture of ensuring that pupils believed in themselves was what brought him success.

She said, “We are certain that he will continue to perform well at the university level. We expect him to obtain a first class honours degree at the end of his university education.

This is because at Wellsprings attention is paid to the individual differences of the pupils who are constantly encouraged and motivated to believe in themselves. Our teachers ensure that the syllabus is covered and they ensure that revisions and coaching are done until each pupil catches up.”
