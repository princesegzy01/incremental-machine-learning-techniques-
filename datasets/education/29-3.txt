EdoPoly to hold maiden inaugural lecture
In line with Governor Godwin Obaseki’s charge to state tertiary institutions to take the lead in proffering solutions to societal challenges, the Edo State Polytechnic, Usen, is set to hold its maiden inaugural lecture to unveil attainments in research at the institution.

The lecture titled ‘Users’ Experience: Designing for the Extremes to Accommodate the Mainstream’, would be delivered by Dr Obokhai Asikhia at the school’s complex on May 30.

This was made known by the Rector of the Polytechnic, Prof. Abiodun Falodun, in a briefing where he said the maiden lecture was part of efforts to reposition the institution as a world-class solution centre.

Noting that this would be the first lecture in the institution 17 years after it was established, Falodun said, “Asikhia will engage the society on his research work in the field of manufacturing engineering, where he is pioneering work on user experience and applying them in real life situations.”
