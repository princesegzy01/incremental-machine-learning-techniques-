Alexander Okere, Benin

The Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State, has warned newly admitted students of the university against cultism and other social vices capable of disrupting their studies.

The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ignatius Onimawo, gave the charge during the matriculation ceremony for 233 students of the institution’s part-time programme.

Onimawo urged the students to shun the temptation to join campus secret cults, which he described as evil and an avenue to self destruction.

He also urged them to uphold the excellent standards for which the school was known.

He said, “I admonish all students to eschew all social vices. Be counted among the law-abiding stock of future leaders.

“Flee cultism and drug abuse. Be sober, vigilant and focused.”

The vice-chancellor, however, advised the new students not to consider their part-time studies as inferior to the regular programme.

He gave them the assurance that both programmes had the same value, curriculum, status and recognition with quality lecturers.

Onimawo stated, “You are being formally admitted into the best state university in Nigeria, aiming to be one of the 10 best (universities) in the country.

“You are being admitted into a great citadel, one of the best for the development of useful skills and aptitude to place you among the upper 10 per cent in Nigeria. I enjoin you to take full advantage of your time of studies.”
