Ataoja High School, Osogbo, Osun State, has received a 16-seater Information and Communication Technology laboratory.

Donated by the old pupils of the school, the laboratory was unveiled during the 40th anniversary of the school.

In his welcome address, the coordinator of Ataoja High School Old Students Association, Mr Kola Ojo, said that members of the association recognised the positive impact, which the school had on them and they decided to give back.

Ojo also said the association had plans to do more. “Our association plans to buy a bus, provide a power generating set and borehole for the school. We have scholarship schemes that some old pupils are running and we hope to expand it. We want to intervene in many ways.”

In a lecture themed, ‘Ataoja High School Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow’, a member of the pioneer set, Prof. Gbenga Adewale of the Institute of Education, University of Ibadan, called for a synergy among all stakeholders for the purpose of improving the standard of the school.

Adewale said, “Parents, teachers, government and old pupils should have a well thought-out plan to further improve on the infrastructure and quality of teaching available to the pupils. We have to collaborate to improve on the successes of these past years.
