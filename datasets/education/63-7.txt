Caro Favoured College, Ajegunle, Lagos, has emerged the national winner of the Junior Achievement Nigeria 2018 National Company of the Year Competition and is set to represent Nigeria against other JA Africa member-nations for the title of Africa Company of the Year in Ghana, come December.

Held at Terra Kulture in Lagos, with the theme, Tech the Future by Storm, the competition saw pupils of the college showcase a rechargeable hand-held LED traffic light which could be used to ease traffic and reduce road accidents.

Speaking on behalf of the team of pupils called, Inventive Explorers, their mentor, Mr Ebuka Ughamadu, said the invention would have a ready market, in addition to being user-friendly.

“Their innovation serves to ease traffic congestion, reduce road accidents and more importantly, to eradicate the common use of red flags and hands by traffic wardens. Their product is a portable user-friendly device that finds a ready market in schools, religious houses, banks, stations, event centres, supermarkets, etc. It comes in different sizes and different LED bulb arrangements. After getting feedback from their customers, after a test-run, the pupils upgraded their product by producing the two-faced hand-held LED traffic light which is favourable for two way traffic,” Ughamadu said.
