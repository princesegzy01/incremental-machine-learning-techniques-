‘Patronise tools that equip pupils for leadership’
Tare Youdeowei

The Chief Executive Officer, HIIMA International Education Services, Dr. Ima Agunbiade-Etiebet, has urged parents, schools and caregivers to ensure pupils have tools to help them internalise what they have been taught in school, particularly those that equip them for leadership and entrepreneurship.

Agunbiade-Etiebet made this known recently at a briefing at Silversands Hall School, Lagos, where she unveiled the limited edition of The Chairman’s Empire, a board game that, according to her, internalises the principles of economics in pupils.

Designed for children from age seven upwards, the CEO said the game, which is a marriage between entertainment and education, was the latest product from HIIMA that took players through the nitty-gritty of modern business practice, including the relationships between buyers and sellers.

Her words, “Our modern-day reality shows that job opportunities are drying up, that is why many graduates still roam the streets in search of jobs many years after graduation. A child brought up with the idea that he or she could establish and run a business may just have his or her mind attuned to being their own bosses after university education, instead of searching for non-existent jobs.

“It is recommended for all aspiring entrepreneurs as it teaches them the fundamentals of investment, when to invest and what to invest in to create greater value. It also teaches how to make and multiply profits and grow the returns on investments,” Agunbiade-Etiebet added.
