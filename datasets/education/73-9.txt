Peter Dada, Akure

The Ondo State Universal Basic Education Board has said that it will build new primary schools and rehabilitate existing ones across the 18 local government areas of the state.

Some of the affected schools include St. James’ Primary School, Oda; L.A Primary School 2 Okebola; St. Stephen’s Primary School, Ijomu; St. Peter’s Demonstration Primary School; SUBEB Model Okuta – Elerinla, Akure; Army Comprehensive Secondary School; Muslim Primary School, Akure; and L.A Primary School Ilu-Abo, in the Akure North Local Government Area, among others.

The Ondo State Chairman of the SUBEB, Princess Oladunni Odu, who spoke while monitoring the level of work done by contractors handling the projects, gave the assurance that the projects would be completed before the resumption of the pupils.

Odu disclosed that all the projects cost N7.8bn, including thier counterpart funds and the one contributed by the state government.

She said “We will get them (projects) completed because we have been paying contractors as and when due. I am sure they are speeding up the job.

“Most of the projects will be ready before the schools resume for a new academic year, while works will remain ongoing after resumption. We shall do our very best to ensure that the children are comfortable.

“We have new constructions going on. The other things we are involved in include the renovation, supply of computers, supply of playground equipment to various schools and the supply of books.”

Odu also explained that 20 school projects, at least, were ongoing in every local government area of the state, saying that all primary schools in the state would benefit.
