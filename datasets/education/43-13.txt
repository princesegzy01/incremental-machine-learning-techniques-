We’ll soon be one of top five varsities – Anchor
Samson Folarin

The Vice-Chancellor of Anchor University, in Ipaja, Lagos, Prof. Joseph Afolayan, on Wednesday said the university was on its way to becoming one of the top five universities in the country.

The VC made this known during the third matriculation of the school where 134 students were matriculated.

The figure, according to the university, consisted of 58 students in the Faculty of Science and Science Education, 69 students for Faculty of Social and Management Sciences and seven students for the Faculty of Humanities.

Afolayan, while enumerating the international partnerships and achievements of the institution, said the university was growing rapidly. “Our target as a university is to become one of the top five universities in Nigeria within 10 years of our existence. The events of the last two years have proven that we mean every bit of those words. We request that you join us in prayers and ensure you support our efforts as important stakeholders in this venture. The beginning may appear seemingly small, Anchor University is vision-born and because we live by the Word of God, our vision shall be fulfilled.

“Since academic activities started on this campus two years ago, we have proven beyond any doubt that we mean business. We have shown that we are committed to the vision of our founding fathers and we are determined to become a major player in the education sector globally.”

Afolayan also appealed to the new students to embrace the motto of the university which is character, competence and courage, as they benefit from the 29 programmes run in the university.
