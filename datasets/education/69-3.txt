African varsities struggle to make impact in global rankings
The 2019 Times Higher Education World University Rankings analysis has been released, with African universities struggling to make an impact.

According to the analysis, there was marked improvement for Asian universities at the expense of stagnation or decline in North America, Europe and Oceania, while Latin American and African universities struggled to make an impact on the rankings.

In Africa, South Africa led the continent on performance, with nine universities in the rankings, led by the University of Cape Town at joint 156th, followed by the University of the Witwatersrand, ranked in the 201-250 band, and Stellenbosch University in the 301-350 band.

Egypt had more than twice as many universities ranked, with 19 included in the table, led by the American University in Cairo, two new entrants â€“ Benha University and Beni-Suef University, and Kafrelsheikh University and Mansoura University, which were all in the 601-800 band.

While Algeria had six in the rankings, but none in the top 800, Morocco had four and Nigeria and Tunisia had three apiece, while Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had just one ranked institution each.
