He said that 160 students graduated in the second class upper division; 178 made it in the second class lower division, while 57 graduated with third class degrees and pass.

Defending the first class products of the university, Adeyewa said the university’s graduates could compete with their colleagues anywhere in the world.

He said, “Some people are that private universities produce many first class products but those saying so have no come here. We have the best teachers; the best and the most modern equipment are here. The teachers are passionate and the environment is conducive.

“Redeemer’s University is better equipped than even some universities abroad. We have fully automated and functional libraries, laboratories. Our students don’t struggle to live so why won’t they make first class. Any first class graduate from the school will make first class in any university in the world.”

Adeyewa said the advent of private universities had introduced a unique dimension to qualitative higher education in the nation, which had engendered efficient service delivery and promotion of healthy competition.

He said the university had on so many awards with its cutting edge research, saying the varsity’s researchers would not relent in making new discoveries.
