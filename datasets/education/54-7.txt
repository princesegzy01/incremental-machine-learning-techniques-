2019 UTME: JAMB warns candidates against fraudsters
The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has called on prospective candidates to disregard advertisements in the social media announcing sales of registration documents with some illegal centres and subject combinations.

The board’s Head, Media and Information, Dr Fabian Benjamin, gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday in Lagos.

He said:“It has come to the notice of the board that some fraudsters have listed out centres for the examination and in the process, inserted some illegal ones.

“Let me state here that all the processes concerning the board can only be done by approved Computer Based Centres.”

According to Benjamin, over 700 centres have so far been accredited for the conduct of the 2019 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination scheduled to commence on March 16.

He said JAMB would soon publish the list of all approved centres in all its state offices nationwide to guide prospective candidates in choosing centres nearest to them.

He announced that the sales of registration documents for the examination would commence on January 10.

“Already the list of over 700 accredited centres for this examination has been uploaded on our website.

“But we have not published any advert concerning all the processes, we are hoping to do so soon.

“Precisely before the commencement of the sales of the forms just as we will paste the list of all the accredited CBT centres at all our state offices nationwide.

“This is to guide the candidates towards the examination processes in order not to fall prey to these fraudsters who are bent on finding ways of causing pains to innocent Nigerians,” Benjamin said.

He said candidates can also go to the “playstore app” on their mobile phones and download “jambibass” to get authentic information especially as regards subject and course combinations among others.
