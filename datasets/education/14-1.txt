Olaide Oyelude, Katsina

Three of the National Youths Service Corps members who survived Sunday’s ghastly road accident in Katsina State are currently receiving treatment at the government-owned State Orthopaedic Hospital in Katsina.

The spokesman for the NYSC in Katsina, Mr Alex Oboameta, confirmed the development on Monday. He said the corps members sustained fractures in the accident.

Oboameta also disclosed that two other corps members were also on admission at the Federal Medical Centre in the state capital, while one corps member was being treated at the General hospital.

The NYSC spokesman added that two corps members were discharged from the hospital. He said,”12 corps members were involved in the accident. Three died, while nine survived. All the surviving corps members, who are on admission are in stable condition. The state NYSC coordinator, Alhaji Ahidjo Yahaya, visited all of them in their various hospitals this morning and they were in good condition.”

He also confirmed that the corpses of the three corps members who died in the accident had been deposited at the General hospital, pending their burial.

Recall that three corps members serving in Katsina State died in a road accident, which occurred at Gobirawa Village in Kankara Local Government Area of the state.

Although the identities of the dead corps members had not been made public by the NYSC management, Oboameta confirmed that all three came from Ebonyi, Imo and Delta states. He also revealed that the deceased included two males and one female.
