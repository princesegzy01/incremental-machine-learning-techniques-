Deloitte holds Young Impact Makers Programme
Deloitte Nigeria held the 4th edition of the Young Impact Makers Programme, a two-week mentoring programme designed to expose select secondary school students across Nigeria to the firm’s core values, business, culture and learning experience.

This year’s programme was made up of 16 students selected from schools across Nigeria. The Young Impact Makers were exposed to exciting career experiences through hands-on blended learning activities, E-learning programmes, mentoring sessions, and on-the-job business management skills.

According to Deloitte’s Talent Partner, Hassan Lawal, the purpose is to make an impact that will matter in the society where it operates.

“This was the driving force behind the intensive coaching and mentoring of the participants during the two-week programme. We believe that creating the platform for the students to gain experience and exposure in a world-class corporate environment will help them gain the clarity they need to be successful,” he said.

The participants also had the opportunity to engage in an interactive session with a Deloitte Alumnus, Mr. Dayo Orolu, Head of Business Development at Siemens Nigeria Limited, who advised them on career development. The Young Impact Makers were also awarded certificates of participation and received other benefits.

The Young Impact Makers Programme aligns with Deloitte WorldClass, a global initiative to impact 50 million futures through education, skills development and access to opportunity by 2030.
