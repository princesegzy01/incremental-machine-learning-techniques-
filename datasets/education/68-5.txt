Tare Youdeowei

The Executive Director, Nubi Educational Counselling Limited, Mrs Rose Omonubi, has identified the lack of motivation, infrastructural decay, poor remuneration and absence of quality teachers as the problems affecting the education sector.

She made this known at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday while announcing the 10thannual Boarding School Fair billed for October 9 and 13 in Lagos and Abuja.

Omonubi, who said the fair was created as a result of the challenges faced by parents in choosing the right foreign university and boarding schools for their children, traced the migration of pupils out of the country to the poor state of education in the country.

“The poor state of the educational sector in Nigeria, lack of motivation, infrastructural decay, poor remuneration and absence of quality teachers are the problems affecting the sector. These have contributed to the high rate of Nigerian students seeking to study abroad, and as the number keeps increasing, there is the need for parents and students to be properly guided in choosing the right institutions that meet their needs and aspirations.”
