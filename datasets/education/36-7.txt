Be more involved in education, chancellor urges parents
The Chancellor of Precious Cornerstone University, Ibadan, Bishop Wale Oke, has advised students to be obedient to their parents, in the latter’s bid to raise them for a guaranteed future.

Oke, who is also the Presiding Bishop of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries, also charged parents to be more involved in the academic pursuits of their children with a view to directing them on a godly path.

He said this in Ibadan while hosting students and staff of the university to a dinner to mark the completion of the institution’s first academic semester.

Oke noted that if the students and their parents were symbiotic in their relationship, the increasing decadence in the society would be reduced, as he lamented that societal values had been debased.

While assuring students of the school’s readiness to ensure that the institution was a force to be reckoned with in the world, Oke enjoined students, parents, the government and other relevant stakeholders to always work towards ensuring that the educational standard in the nation was improved.

The Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Kola Oloke, while thanking God for the end of the first semester, urged the students to always be good ambassadors of the institution anywhere they found themselves.
