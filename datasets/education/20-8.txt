Dayo Ojerinde

As part of its resolve to reposition the alumni body, the Lagos Branch of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State Alumni Association is set to hold its maiden 2019 quarterly general meeting.

The event scheduled to hold on July 28 will serve as an avenue for members to network among themselves, as well as discuss how to contribute to the development of the university and its environs.

The Lagos Branch Chairman of the Association, Mr Olabode S. Akinrimisi, in a statement said there was the need for alumni to come together to build a strong network and focus on how to move their Alma Mata forward.

“All over the world, alumni play a great role in the development of the school they graduated from. They also meet from time to time to bond together, network and help one another. For us, it is something we want to build on and replicate the tradition of great universities in building a strong and formidable alumni body,” Akinrimisi said.

The event will also serve as an avenue for a bye-election to the vacant positions of the Public Relations Officer and Welfare Officer of the association.
