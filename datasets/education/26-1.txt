Workers in Plateau tertiary institutions suspend 7 month-old strike
James Abraham, Jos

Workers in seven government-owned tertiary institutions in Plateau State, who have been on strike since April 23, 2019 under the aegis of the Joint Union of Workers in Plateau Tertiary Institutions, have suspended the strike.

The Chairman of the union, Mr Paul Dakogol, announced the suspension of the strike at a briefing held in Jos on Monday.

The workers had gone on strike in protest against the Plateau State Government’s inability to develop the education sub-sector in the state. They had demanded, among other things, improved infrastructure and the recruitment of more teaching and non-teaching staff in their respective institutions.

Dakogol said the workers decided to call off the strike because the state government had addressed some of the issues that triggered it.

Dakogol said, “The state government has been able to address some of the contentious issues during the strike. Last week, it had an agreement with the union, regarding some issues that both parties could not handle immediately.

“The issues that were addressed during the strike include the payment of workers’ salaries, the unpaid check up dues and cooperative deductions, remittance of gratuities for the months of February and March 2019 and staff recruitment. The latter is an ongoing process.

“Following the appreciable development in the negotiations, the union, after thorough consultations with its members, thereby directs the suspension of the seven weeks strike, with immediate effect from April 17, 2019

The Chairman commended Governor Simon Lalong, for his understanding and his decision to resolve the issues.
