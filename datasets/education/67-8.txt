The Academic Director, International Executive MBA, Lagos Business School, Dr Uchenna Uzo, has reiterated that the MBA graduates of the school have been equipped to understand the growing market opportunities in Nigeria.

Uzo noted that the programme content explores the most promising aspects of the country’s potential and participants were equipped with the knowledge to spot what it takes to invest and improve intercultural exchange among people interested in investing in Africa.

He made the statement at the International Executive MBA Week themed, ‘Playing to Win in Africa: Exploring Business Opportunities in Nigeria,’ held between September 10 and 14, 2018.

The five-day programme according to Uzo helped to prepare participants for greater business opportunities, enabling them to manage business across borders and to face higher leadership responsibilities after their MBA programmes.

“The International Executive MBA Week programme was built around strategies for managing a business in a complex or turbulent environment; using innovation to cope with uncertainty,” he said.
