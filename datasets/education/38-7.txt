Clever Clogs Books is set to hold a pioneer Nigerian books festival specifically for children to promote literacy and the joy of reading.

The festival, ‘Akada Children’s Book Festival,’ is billed for Saturday, April 27, at the British Council.

According to a statement on Wednesday by Clever Clogs, the festival is targeted at children, parents, teachers, children’s book authors and illustrators.

It read, “The aim of the festival is to spark and sustain a healthy literary lifestyle from childhood and encourage literary creativity in Nigeria; thus, acting as a stepping stone towards an intellectually sound society.

“The festival is expected to get children excited about literature, literacy and creativity while giving them ample tools to create bright futures and live their dreams through the power of reading and writing.”

Clever Clogs also said the festival would feature the inauguration and public reading of a children’s picture book titled, ‘Why You Do You Wash Your Hands?’ authored by Olubunmi Aboderin-Talabi.

“The book will be published in a combo set of four languages; English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo to promote indigenous language usage in children’s literature and encourage simple yet effective hygiene tips. It is also the first Nigerian children’s picture book to contain stickers in four languages,” the statement read.
