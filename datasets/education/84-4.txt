Edo deploys quality assurance personnel to oversee teaching
The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has approved the deployment of quality assurance personnel to public primary schools across the state.

This was disclosed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Basic Education and Acting Chairman, Edo SUBEB, Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe, on Tuesday in Benin City.

Oviawe explained that the decision was in line with the state government’s strategy to strengthen the inspectorate arm of the primary education sub-sector for better monitoring of the impact of the ongoing reform in the sector.

“The deployment follows the revamp of the Inspectorate Division. Qualified and outstanding teachers already in the public school system are being recruited and trained for this role and deployed on a ratio of one quality assurance staff to 10 schools,” the governor’s aide said.

On the specific roles of the quality assurance personnel, Oviawe said, “They are to visit schools every day and send their reports to SUBEB on a daily basis using their digital devices. The personnel will monitor teachers on their teaching, as well as take inventory of teaching aids and equipment in the schools, including what works and what is broken.”
