Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo State has announced the release of N2.86bn for the construction and remodelling of 305 primary and secondary schools, which he said would enhance qualitative education in the state.

This was made known by the State Commissioner for Information, Chidiebere Nzeh, who represented Okorocha during a briefing held at the Government House in Owerri on Thursday.

Okorocha explained that the reconstruction was in continuation of the free and qualitative education programme of his government, as he announced that N5bn had been mapped out for payment of pension arrears to retired civil servants in the state.

“A committee comprising representatives of the Nigerian Labour Congress, state government and pensioners has been set up to ensure transparency. Civil servants will be receiving their salaries during the first week of every month. Over N9bn had been mapped out for the payment of October and November salaries,” Okorocha said.

He added that N432m had also been released to clear the September and October salaries, as well as the allowances of the elected 645 Councillors.
