Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

The Nexford University has partnered a former Minister of Education, Dr Obiageli Ezekwesili, on a scholarship programme for Nigerian women studying in universities.

The university said the scholarship programme in Bachelor of Business Administration took-off in January when Ezekwesili was appointed a member of Nexford Advisory Board.

The institution noted that it had also partnered Dangote Group to provide scholarships to more deserving Nigerians to pursue academic degrees.

In a statement released on Monday, Nexford, an online university with headquarters in Washington, United States, said it hoped to invest more than $6m in Nigeria to start ‘globally affordable degree programmes.’

The university said, “Nexford is about to begin globally affordable degree programmes. Students in Nigeria can earn a Bachelor of Business Administration. On February 1, 2019, the online university opened its virtual doors to its first cohort of learners.

“In January 2019, a former Nigerian Minister of Education, Dr Oby Ezekwesili, became a member of Nexford’s Advisory Board and announced a scholarship programme for Nigerian women studying on the university’s bachelors programme. The university also began a scholarship programme with Dangote Group, the largest manufacturing conglomerate in West Africa.”
