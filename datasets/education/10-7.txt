Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

The Federal Government through the National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education has urged Nigerians to embrace the use of local languages in education and literacy.

The commission said on Sunday that the embrace of local languages in Nigeria was necessary to have a more literate and sustainable society.

The Executive Secretary, Prof Abba Haladu, stated this in Abuja on Sunday to mark the 2019 International Literacy Day, according to a release obtained by our correspondent.

He said, “We solicit for more support and commitment from all the tiers of government, development partners, the private sector and non-governmental organisations in tackling the literacy challenges in the country.

“I urge Nigerians to embrace the use of local languages in education and literacy as key towards a more literate and sustainable society.”

According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, Cultural Organisation, September 8 was declared the International Literacy Day in 1966.
