The Federal Government, through the National Centre for Women Development, has commenced education programmes on Information and Communication Technology for physically-challenged girls and women at the centre.

The NCWD Director-General, Dr Mary Ekpere-Eta, confirmed the ICT training for the disabled females at a briefing held on Thursday in Abuja, to mark the 2019 International Women’s Day, themed, Think equal, build smart, innovate for change.

Ekpere-Eta said, “In addressing the issue of ICT, the centre runs a girls’ coding programme to connect young girls and women to the information super highway and enable them to explore opportunities available in the sector.

“To ensure that no one is left out, the centre trains girls and women with disabilities on the use of ICT with a special centre dedicated to the visually impaired. In 2018, 50 persons were trained in ICT and Project Management. Owing to this success, it is in our plans to scale up this ICT education.”

The DG added that the Federal Government had also resolved to open a gender- based violence electronic dashboard to name and shame sex offenders and rehabilitate victims.

“We are working towards the actualisation of the theme and providing social protection for the Nigerian woman and girl-child. The NCWD and the Office of the Wife of the President established a Gender-based Violence Electronic dashboard. This is to improve documentation and set up a tracking mechanism of gender-based violence trends across the country. It is also to prosecute offenders as well as rehabilitate victims and their families,” Ekpere-Eta
