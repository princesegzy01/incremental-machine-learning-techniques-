CRUTECH’s first female acting VC assumes office
Ada Wodu, Calabar

Prof. Akon Joshua has assumed office as the first female acting Vice-Chancellor of the Cross River University of Technology in Calabar.

Joshua took over from Prof. Owan Enoh at the end of his five-year tenure.

She is expected to pilot the affairs of the institution for three months, pending the appointment of a substantive vice-chancellor by Governor Ben Ayade.

While handing over, Enoh appealed to the new leadership of the university to ensure that it would not go back to its dark days. He urged the staff and students to cooperate with the acting VC so that the institution would attain its desired goals.

He also called on the university’s Senate to grant full pardon to erring members of the academic staff of the university.

The acting VC, Prof. Akon Joshua, appealed for the support of the students and the management staff to enable her to take the institution to greater heights.

She said, “The task ahead is daunting and cannot be accomplished without the cooperation of all stakeholders.”

Joshua said she believed that her vast knowledge of the school would enable her to succeed, pending when a substantive VC would be appointed to take over from her.

She appealed to students to avoid acts that could drag the image of the institution in the mud.
