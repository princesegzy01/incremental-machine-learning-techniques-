Singer, Lanre Fasasi, aka Sound Sultan, has unveiled details for the second edition of his Broadway-styled musical, tagged, ‘Jungle Story 2’.

The highly anticipated show, which features many of Nigeria’s most prominent actors and musicians, is scheduled to hold for three days in Lagos.

Speaking on the inspiration behind the musical, Sound Sultan stated that it was his opinion on the events and occurrences in the country. He said, “The story is about a land that became a jungle because the motherland cast a spell on its people that whoever indulged in corruption would be transformed into an animal. Over the years, it became a full-fledged jungle due to the pervasive corruption acts of its people.”

Entertainers on the bill for the show include 2baba, Femi Kuti, Odunlade Adekola, Osas Ajibade, Femi Branch, Richard Mofe-Damijo, Lasisi Elenu, AY, Yaw, MI, Basket Mouth, Kate Henshaw, Harrysong, Helen Paul, Ninja Band, Seyi Shay, Darey, among others.
