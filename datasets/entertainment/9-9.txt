No need body shaming, Africans love plus-sized women – Sound Sultan
Olajide Samuel

Back in 2013, many of the fans of versatile Nigerian singer, Sound Sultan, were quite surprised when the singer sang about plus-sized women, calling them ‘orobo’.

The singer got a lot of commendations from plus-sized women who had been body-shamed in the past.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, the singer said, “Everybody cannot sing about the government being bad. Yes, we have danced. We know about a girl’s bum– it is big and round. We like it. Except one is pretending, every guy loves a woman’s curves. When I released the song, Orobo, full figured women suddenly became my fans. We can’t be body shaming plus-sized women when we know Africans love them that way.”

On appealing to a younger generation, Sultan noted that he was lucky to have kicked off his career with them. “I am lucky I started with the new generation because a lot of kids loved Jangbajantis and they grew with me. The kids in that video are now between 27 and 28.”

Sultan, who also doubles as an actor, advised that parents should monitor the kind of music their kids listened to. “These days, parents are allowing their kids listen to any kind of music they fancy, and that’s not right. When I go to some parties and the DJ plays some songs, I tell them to reduce the volume at some parts.”
