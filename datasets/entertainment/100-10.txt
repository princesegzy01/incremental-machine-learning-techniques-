Businessman, Nduka Obasi, has joined the league of record label owners as he recently floated Tomrice Entertainment Worldwide. While unveiling his latest project, he told Saturday Beats that to kick-start his music business, he signed two new artistes- Franklin Chukwunonso, aka Billi and Isaac Osamudiamen, aka Isick – to the label.

The record label boss said he delved into the business of making music because of his love for good music, adding that it was his intention to be a major player in the industry.

He said, “I decided to set up a record label because I love good music and entertainment is my lifestyle, so having a record label is a plus to my vision. Apart from this record label, I have other businesses; this is just one of them. I was inspired to own a record label because of my love of good music.

“I had my mapped out plans before I decided to venture into this business and I know how to handle this business. I signed two new artistes on my record label because I noticed that they are people I can work with; I know that if I spend my money on them I would achieve results. It is an investment and I plan to yield a good result.”

Speaking ecstatically about his new deal, one of his new artistes, Isick said, “I do afro-trap; it is a rare genre of music in Nigeria but I aim to make it popular. If the sound works for you then the people would love it and that would help me attain fame. That is all it takes. I decided to do afro-trap because I do not want to box myself into a corner. I want to be versatile in anything that I do.”
