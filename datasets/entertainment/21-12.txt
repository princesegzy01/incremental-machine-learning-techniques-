Fans and social media followers of actor, Ken Erics, have been reacting to the revelation made by his wife, Onyi Adada. She had shocked many of her followers on Instagram when she revealed on Friday that she had been subjected to pain and emotional trauma for the past 10 months, as her husband abandoned their marriage and moved out of their apartment.

Reacting to a post on the purported crash of another actor, Blossom Chukwujekwu’s marriage, she had written, “Is this how celebrities behave because that is how my own left the house. My own left home for 10 months.”

Our correspondent sent messages to Adada to confirm the veracity of her claim, but didn’t get a reply as of the time of filing this report. However, a search on their respective Instagram pages showed that they had stopped following each other.

Meanwhile, Ken Erics’ fans have continued to leave different comments on his Instagram page.

A certain Mizpretty wrote, “I wonder what you guys are teaching your fans when it comes to marriage. Why marry if you can’t stay married”?

Another wrote, “You are working hard away from your family”.

“Later, he will be singing gospel songs up and down”, “PoshAlhaji wrote.

Ken got married to Adada in 2017.
