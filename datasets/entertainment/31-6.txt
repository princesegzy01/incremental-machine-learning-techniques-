Reckonect set to reposition Karaoke music
The Founder, Reckonect Karaoke System, Mr Ohio Giwa-Amu, has said that Karaoke music can be a unifying and soul lifting factor for Nigerians as he disclosed that grand winner would enjoy major sponsorship.

Ohio affirmed that his firm would do more to reposition karaoke music in Nigeria and give it a facelift.

He said this at the just concluded Karaoke music challenge held at Brizz Lounge Lekki, Lagos.

He said, “The journey has begun with the challenge. Surely, this is the first in the 10 challenges that will culminate in a grand finale. All the finalists will slug it out to determine the best of all the best.

“The eventual winner will be sponsored to attend major singing competition around the world like ‘the idol’, ‘the voice’ etc.”

Giwa-Amu, however, lamented over the sudden loss of interest in karaoke by members of the public and its disenfranchisement.

He said, “Karaoke music consists of basically soul-lifting songs, but it has become boring and monotonous in this part of the world. There is a loss of interest and disenfranchisement in the music. I believe that repositioning it the way we are doing now will re-ignite that lost flame, create awareness and encourage its growth and development in the country.”

He noted that with government participation, Karaoke would get to the next level and boost tourism in Nigeria.
