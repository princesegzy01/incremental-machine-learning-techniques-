Guitarists not appreciated in Nigeria –Fiokee
Olajide Samuel

Ifiok Effanga, aka Fiokee, who is a guitarist and music producer that has worked with top artistes such as Flavour, D’banj, Adekunle Gold, Kizz Daniel and others, has said guitarists are not appreciated in this part of the world.

The beat maker, who calls himself the ‘number one Afrobeats recording guitarist in the country’, in an interview with Saturday Beats, said, “In this part of the world, guitarists are not really appreciated so I decided to set myself apart.

“Other guitarists see the guitar as an instrument but I see mine as a microphone. My guitar speaks while those of others simply play. I record my lines and I don’t make my guitar sound too analog. I process my guitar sounds and understand the difference between playing the guitar in the studio and performing on stage.”

He added, “Afrobeats has gone global now and I’m proud to be part of that movement. Many people all over the world enjoy our beats.”

The producer credited Flavour and D’banj as some of the artistes who have contributed to the growth of his career.

He said, “Flavour is a very good artiste and his platform has pushed me further. It has made me more recognised and respected in the industry. Also, I worked with D’banj for four years and it was a very good platform for me too. In all, I feel honoured. Undoubtedly, it pays to work hard and be consistent.”
