The second season of a music competition for higher institutions in Nigeria, Campus Classicals, has commenced.

Unveiling plans for the new season in Lagos recently, the Managing Director, Classical Showcase Limited, Mr. Sylvester Obriko, said Campus Classicals was a first of its kind in Nigeria. Obriko stated, “The competition is becoming a big deal, as over 20 higher institutions across all the six geo-political zones in Nigeria will participate, while the grand finale will hold at the Muson Centre, Lagos, in November.”

Also speaking at the unveiling ceremony, a professor of Musicology, Prof Anthony Mereni, said Campus Classicals Season 2 would have a bigger impact on the campus communities, even beyond the season one where the University of Nigeria Nsukka and Delta State University emerged first and second respectively.

Meanwhile, the Managing Director of Zoya Media Limited, Nwogo Onyejepu, urged corporate organisations and individuals to take advantage of the rewarding partnership opportunities that the music competition would offer.
