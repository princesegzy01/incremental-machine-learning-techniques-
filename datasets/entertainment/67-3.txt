Unlike video directors, only a girl accused me of rape – Pretty Mike

Last year, a lady accused Pretty Mike of raping her when she was younger. During the week, the same Pretty Mike called out top video directors such as Clarence Peters, Unlimited LA and Paul Gambit, for always taking advantage of female dancers.

Speaking with Sunday Scoop, Pretty Mike said his rape story was different from the case of the video directors. He stated, “It was only a lady that accused me of sexually molesting her. If there were five or 10 ladies like in the case of the video directors, it would have been a different story. I didn’t just hear from one lady; more than 10 people made such accusations. And there is no smoke without fire. In my life, only a lady accused me of rape.”

The nightclub owner said he was sure of all his allegations. He stated, “I am in the industry and a lot of these girls are my friends. I get to hear these accusations many times. If you look at the comments on social media, girls came out publicly to say they were victims, or their friends were victims.”

Describing Peters as gentle, hardworking, and the best in his field, Pretty Mike added, “It doesn’t mean he doesn’t have his flaws or that he doesn’t take advantage of ladies. In this country, everyone finds a way of taking advantage of people.”

Meanwhile, in reaction to the allegations, Paul Gambit told Sunday Scoop that he was too busy to pay attention to irrelevant things. He stated, “I didn’t see any accusation (Pretty Mike’s post). I have been busy working and I don’t have time for certain things.”
