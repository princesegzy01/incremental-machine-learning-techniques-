Why I called out Wizkid- Northboi
Olajide Samuel

Weeks back, music producer, Northboi, had accused Wizkid of not giving him due credit for producing the song, Joro. The music producer, who has worked with other high profile artistes, including Tiwa Savage, Davido and Mayorkun, made the allegation on his Twitter page.

In an interview with Sunday Scoop, NorthBoi insisted that Wizkid ‘disregarded’ his life and career. He said, “I called out Wizkid over Jorobecause of (his) inappropriate behaviour. He brought personal feelings into a professional arrangement. What he did was spiteful and a total disregard for my life, family and career.”

The producer, however, maintained that he did not have any regrets working with the ‘star boy’. “I have no regrets. I have just learnt lessons. I still love him,” he added.

The beat maker also said working with the likes of Tiwa Savage, Davido and other pop stars had enlightened him.

“It’s more of what it has done to my mind than my career. Working with these folks has enlightened me. I learn from them and incorporate the lessons into my career.”
