Online comedian, Sydney Egere, popularly known as Sydney Talker, was lambasted during the week after one of his comedy skits went viral.

In the skit, a curvy lady was shown walking on the street. In order to get her attention, one of Sydney’s co-actors pretended to be a police officer and started touching her bum. This sparked different reactions on social media with many criticising the comedian for encouraging sexual harassment.

Yoruba actress, Jaiye Kuti, who found the skit distasteful wrote, “Stupid boys.” A blogger, Naija Single Girl, wrote, “You have been doing so well but why this? Why? How are sexual harassment skits funny for God’s sake?”

Another follower, @Dannywalter wrote, “I love Sydney Talker and I think he is actually funny but constantly making the same type of skits more so sexual, makes it seem like he is out of content. It really reeks of clout chasing!”

@ChidiOkereke said, “Sad to see Sydney Talker sink into that hole most entertainers eventually put themselves in. That hole where they deliberately create plainly controversial content, just to be in the news. Sad that this time he’s focusing on joking with something as prevalent as sexual harassment.”
