Top comedian, Seyi Law, is ready to take on Lagos for this year’s edition of his show, Fast and Funny, which holds next Sunday at the Eko Hotels and Suites, Victoria Island. Tagged the Blacker than Ever edition, Seyi Law said he wants to flip the funny (and maybe forgotten) side of our notable black history. He added, “This year, we want to dig deep with spontaneous, historic and very realistic comedy. So you get to laugh, dance and party all night. At the end of the day, you would also go home more knowledgeable about your history. Veteran comedian, Gordons would lead comic acts such as Dan D’Humorous, Chuks D General, Aproko, Destalker, Jacinta, Princewill, Whalemouth, and others for the event.

Lovebirds, Adekunle Gold and his wife, Simi, together with Duncan Mighty, MI, Small Doctor, Reekado Banks, among others would thrill guests with music on the night.”
