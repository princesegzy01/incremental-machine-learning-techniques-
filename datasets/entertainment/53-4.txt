Actor, Bigvai Jokotoye, could be said to be on the fast lane to reckoning in the movie industry when he suddenly jetted out of the country. In a chat with Sunday Scoop, he explained why he relocated at that time. He said, “I relocated to build my family and move on with my life. However, I’m still doing my best to remain in the industry as much as I can. I just produced a movie titled, Mr Roland, and I’m working on other productions to be shot soon. I have also featured in some Hollywood/Nollywood movies.”

On the belief that one needs a godfather to rise in Nollywood, Jokotoye said, “For some, I think it’s not necessary because talent speaks for them, while some depend on godfathers. Marketers are godfathers to some, especially ladies, while men, most times, have no godfathers.”

The actor also stressed that it would be tough surviving on acting alone in Nigeria. “I don’t think one can survive on acting alone in Nigeria because investors are not really pumping money into the industry and that is why producers pay actors peanuts. It’s hard to see an actor who gets paid up to a million naira for a movie because we still produce substandard movies. Our marketing system is bad and people are afraid of investing. So, I think it’s hard to survive without making money from other businesses, endorsements or financial support from fans,” he said.
