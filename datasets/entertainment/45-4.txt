Tofarati Ige

After a successful collaboration with Davido, SMGO Music signee, Pelli, has teamed up with Peruzzi in another song titled, Turn Up.

In the mid-tempo Afrocentric tune produced by Dr. Syk, there is obvious chemistry between the two artistes. They combined perfectly to deliver a tune that is sure to catch the attention of music lovers.

Speaking on the new song, Pelli said, “After the success of my song, Your Type, on which I featured Davido, I’m excited to be working with a fellow talented artiste like Peruzzi. Turn Up was something we did in less than two hours. There was a lot of positive energy in the studio that day and I truly appreciate the special talent that Peruzzi is. The video shoot in Lagos was a different thing entirely and we had fun.”
