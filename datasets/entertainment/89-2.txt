Kelly Anthony dedicates new album to Lagosians
Canada-based Nigerian singer, Kelly Anthony, has just released a new album titled, EKO. But beyond the euphoria of having an album to his credit, he appears to be focused on bigger plans, such as helping the less-privileged to achieve their own dreams.

The singer dedicates EKO to all hardworking and law-abiding residents of Lagos who toil through thick and thin to earn a decent living.

“The struggles and hardships that I went through to accomplish my goals and aspirations inspired me to write this song. My overall goal is to become a strong force to reckon with in the Nigerian music industry in 2019. I want to take over the spotlight and collaborate with as many top Nigerian artistes as possible.

“I want to create a solid fan base across Africa. Also, I want to tour university campuses, media houses and clubs in Nigeria, as well as to connect with my fans in the country,” he says.

The proceeds from the sale of the album, he adds, will be donated to charity.
