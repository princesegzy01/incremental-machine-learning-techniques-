Talented teenager and inspirational artiste, Iseoluwa Abidemi, has released another inspirational single titled, ‘Yes I can’ and it has been gathering a lot of media buzz since its release.

Produced by top beat maker, Ambassador Wole Oni, the new song is a message to every child to believe in his/her potential by being focused, tenacious and dedicated.

On what inspired the song, Iseoluwa said, “This is a project that is so dear to my heart and I can’t wait to get positive responses about the impact of the song.”

Later in the month, Iseoluwa will also launch her album and NGO in Lagos with headliners such as Wole Oni, Bee-Jay Sax, Tope Alabi, Tim Godfrey, Laolu Gbenjo, Mercy Chinwo and Mike Abdul among many others.

Iseoluwa noted that the essence of all she does is to influence the world positively, using her music as a major tool, while ‘simultaneously appreciating God’s wonderful work in her life’.

“I feel so excited as a young artiste because music has always been one of my foremost means of expression. I use it to express the mind of God and to encourage people to worship God. I am passionate about music but I hope to be a lawyer in future,” she added.
