Gani Adams slams Olugbo of Ugbo for installing ‘fake obas’
The Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Aare Gani Adams, has urged the South-West governors and traditional rulers to call the Olugbo of Ugbo kingdom, Oba Fredrick Obateru Akinruntan, to order following the installation of some persons as Yoruba monarchs in the diaspora in his palace in Ugboland, Ondo State.

He described Oba Akinruntan’s action as a complete desecration of Yoruba’s culture, tradition, and value.

The Oodua Peoples Congress leader stated, “I was in South Africa, on a holiday when this was brought to my attention. This imprudence is fraudulent, a clear and present danger that can destroy our tradition if something urgent is not done immediately.

” I urge South-West governors, especially Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, and Yoruba monarchs, to please call him to order

immediately before it is too late.”

The Aare also cautioned the one-time oil marketer to desist from fighting against the Ooni of Ife.
