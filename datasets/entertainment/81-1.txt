The Ooni also announced that he has given 2Face Idibia a new name ‘Tubobo’ which according to him was because of his never-aging look.

“You are now also TuBobo; Annie, please don’t get angry about the new name I just gave your husband, it is because he looks much younger every passing day… I bid you greater successes in life. #OoniofIfe #Otisese,” he said.
