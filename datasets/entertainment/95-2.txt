People who criticised my twerking video are hypocrites –Anita Joseph
Tofarati Ige

Actress, Anita Joseph, is no stranger to controversies. She knows how to court attention and it seems people cannot get enough of her. She recently posted a video of herself ‘twerking up a storm’ and as expected, it went viral. Many slammed her for the video but Joseph’s feathers are unruffled.

She told Sunday Scoop, “I don’t care about people that had negative things to say about the video. Nollywood made me and I am grateful to the industry. Many of the people that criticised me are hypocrites. Some of them still use my videos and pictures to ‘help’ themselves. They have it on their laptops and phones. Despite all the noise, two companies recently signed me as a brand ambassador. One of them is a cosmetics company and the other is a travel agency. I will continue to do what I know how to do best.”

Speaking on some of the changes she would like to see in the industry, Anita said, “I want us to stop stereotyping artists, and start making better movies. In the area of editing, I get irritated, sad and disappointed when I watch some movies and some things that should have been corrected by an editor are left there. That’s not too professional.”

On if she would be getting married this year, the curvaceous actress giggled and said, “No one should know that part. It’s supposed to be confidential.”
