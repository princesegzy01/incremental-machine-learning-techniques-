Glamour in entertainment industry is distracting –Yinka Davies

Actress, singer and dancer, Yinka Davies, is an entertainer par excellence who has paid her dues. Having been in the industry for over two decades, Davies does know her onions when it comes to the craft.

However, she is not happy because it seems many entertainers have lost sight of their true calling by focusing on the glitz in the industry. Speaking on her experience in the movie industry, she told Sunday Scoop, “The glamour is distracting and it diverts people’s attention because they refuse to see that there’s more to life than just the ‘glam’. There is more to life than the PR, glitz or dressing. It is about what you are bringing to the table when the glamour is out. This is one of the major problems where we want you to see the classy part and not what can improve another person’s life on a daily basis. After all the glamour, what next? The arts have a very important role to play in the betterment of society. Beyond the seeming superficiality of the entertainment industry, there should be tangible lessons that we can teach people through the vehicle of movies, music, or any other form of arts.”
