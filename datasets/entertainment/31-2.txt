No big deal carrying my child –Deyemi Okanlawon
Kore Ogidan and Dayo Adelola

Actor, Deyemi Okanlawon, welcomed his second child last year, and he has been taking on a lot of daddy duties. The father of two sons, who is fond of sharing pictures of his family on his social media page, has often posted videos of him feeding and taking care of his offspring.

During the week, he shared a picture of his son strapped to his back and captioned it #daddyduties and #whosyourdaddy. However, some social media users criticised his post, asking if he was expecting their praise for being a father to his son. Many also insinuated that he did the act to have a picture to upload on social media.

When SATURDAY BEATS reached out to the actor, he maintained that he didn’t do anything out of the ordinary. He stated, “They (critics) should have their own children and choose how to delegate domestic chores with their spouses.

“One of our goals as a couple and family is to attain a work-life balance and a measure of financial freedom. I have constantly sought how to increasingly add and receive more value by working smart, investing wisely and labouring less. By the grace of God, I am now able to be more actively involved in raising and spending quality time with my boys, rather than overworking myself to pay bills while burdening my wife with all domestic chores, in addition to her already tasking career. I am sure you can imagine how much love and other things I’m getting from her in return, so at the end of the day, it’s a plus for me.”
