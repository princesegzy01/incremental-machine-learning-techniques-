Addiction to a girl inspired me to write Jealous –Fireboy DML
Olajide Samuel

Fast-rising singer, Adedamola Adefola, popularly called Fireboy DML, is no doubt getting more attention by the day.

Armed with the hit song, Jealous, the YBNL artiste in a chat with Sunday Scoop recounted the inspiration behind the tune.

“Jealous was inspired by personal experience. I had a roller-coaster affair with a young lady that turned into an unhealthy addiction. I wanted to relive the experience in a song, so I did,” he said.

On what makes him a remarkable singer, Fireboy stated, “I am obsessed with being different in everything I do, so when I make music, I always have it in mind to do it differently. That is what drives me every time.”

Sharing the strangest experience he has ever had with a fan, Fireboy said “Dealing with fans is a delicate thing. I once met a fan that saw me at a mall and started screaming and at the same time singing almost all my songs right there. People stopped to watch. I was embarrassed and didn’t know how to react, so I just politely stopped him and greeted him. It was a weird but emotional moment for me.”

Recalling how he got signed to Olamide’s YBNL label, the Ogun State indigene said, “Olamide actually reached out to me himself. He explained how much he believed in my dream and said he wanted to make things happen for me. I couldn’t refuse.”
