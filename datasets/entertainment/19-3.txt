Many love songs not romantic – Walexy
Budding singer, producer and sound engineer, Wale Israel-Lagbokun, aka Walexy, has said that a lot of the so-called love songs churned out these days are not romantic.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, he stated, “I am not too pleased with the kind of love songs we have these days. Back in the days, love songs actually had soft, romantic and introspective lyrics. But these days, most of the songs are almost violent in nature. And that is what inspired my latest song, For You. I wanted to make a love song that everyone would be able to relate to and that would be evergreen– a song that one can listen to in 20 years’ time and still enjoy. Then, I started summing up the lyrics, recorded it and the song was created. I sang, produced and mixed it myself.”

On what inspires him, Walexy said, “I am usually inspired by everything that happens to me; whether good or bad, happy or sad.”

Tracing the genesis of his career, the rising entertainer stated, “I started my music career professionally at the age of 17, although I have always loved singing and making music. I would describe my music as alternative afro pop. I am not signed to any record label yet because I haven’t really got the right deal”

The singer also noted that promoting his songs was the major challenge he was facing at the current stage of his career.

Walexy, who also makes cartoons and edits videos, stated that he always strived to be flexible and creative.
