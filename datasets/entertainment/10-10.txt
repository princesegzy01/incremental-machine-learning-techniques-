Keep same energy when we meet, Tiwa warns OAPs insulting her in leaked video
Nigerian Afropop singer, Tiwa Savage, has reacted to a viral video of some female radio presenters insulting her while in the studio, which was leaked on social media.

The three On-Air personalities at City 105.1 FM in Lagos State were caught on tape slandering Tiwa and another singer, Yemi Alade, while in the studio.

Tiwa took to her Instagram page to express her displeasure, saying, “The so-called female gatekeepers that are supposed to help fellow female artists are the ones abusing female artists not knowing cameras were still rolling”.
