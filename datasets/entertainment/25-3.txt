If you are making a list of Nigeria’s top music producers, Ben’Jamin Obadje, aka Spellz, will definitely make the cut.

The beat maker who has produced songs for artistes such as Tiwa Savage and Wizkid, told Saturday Beats that his synergy with both artistes makes it possible to come up with hit records. He said, “It’s been an amazing journey. Tiwa Savage, Wizkid and I have a synergy that works every time. We understand what needs to be done on a record and go all out for it.”

Asked about his ‘recipe’ for making hit songs, Spellz stated, “Apart from possessing the unique skill to make good music, I would say experience, and understanding one’s audience works. I make sure I bring out the best in individual artistes, and this takes a lot of discipline. But, most producers don’t have that patience.”
