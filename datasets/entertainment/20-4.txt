Nigerians not ready to fight for the change we seek –Yul Edochie
Olajide Samuel

Actor cum politician, Yul Edochie, says he has learnt a lot of lessons since he ventured into politics.

In an encounter with Saturday Beats, he said, “As I ventured into politics, I realised that things are different from the inside. I found that many Nigerians are not ready to fight for the change we seek. Even the youth are not yet ready to come together and fight for their future. But we will keep pushing.”

On why Nigerians don’t engage their leaders enough, Edochie stated that they were easily distracted by trivial issues.

He added, “Nigerians don’t engage the government enough. They are easily distracted by trivial issues. They pay more attention to those mundane things, and blame everyone else around them rather than engage the government.”

The actor also stated that his mother supported him when he got married at the age of 22. “My mum supported me. She wanted me to marry early just like my father did so I would be more focused,” he added.
