About a week ago, news went viral that veteran and popular fuji musician, K1 de Ultimate, had impregnated and married a socialite, Aramide Adenle. According to the reports, K1 allegedly spent N15m to host a party for her.

However, the Vivid Imagination singer’s spokesperson, Kunle Rasheed, has denied the news, saying, “A man of K1’s calibre and accomplishments cannot enter into such union without the knowledge of his family and friends, which indeed include top media practitioners.”

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, Rasheed maintained that there was no untoward relationship between K1 and Adenle. He said, “Truly, Alhaji knows her but they are not in any relationship. He sang her praise in his last album, and I was hailed there too. K1 is in the habit of calling everyone ‘omo mi (my child)’ but some people read it differently to mean she’s his wife. He also hailed her at a burial in Ibadan.

“Even when I posted K1’s rebuttal on my Facebook page, one of the wives of the late MKO Abiola, Titi, made a comment that she knew the lady in question very well. She also stated that she knew who the lady was married to and the father of her child. She said her father and the lady’s father were best of friends.”

On how K1’s ‘wives’ reacted to the news, Rasheed stated, “Alhaji has just one wife and her name is Fathia. She said she knew it was a lie even though some people wanted to poison her mind. She didn’t feel bad about it because the lady is her friend.”
