Rapper, Akumefule Chukwu-Emeka, popularly known as Blaqbonez, generated mixed reactions on social media when he released a ‘diss’ track titled, Best Rapper in Africa.

In the song, Blaqbonez declared himself as the best rapper in Africa, and many felt it was premature for him to claim that title at this stage of his career.

Speaking with Sunday Scoop, however, he said inasmuch as he didn’t mean to disrespect established rappers, he was not a coward. He stated, “Someone ‘dissed’ me and in my response, I felt I needed to wake other rappers up as well. I honestly feel that a smart rapper will understand what is going on, instead of getting angry with me. I expect them to understand what I did for the rap industry. Obviously, I didn’t try to disrespect MI, Vector, Jesse Jagz and other established rappers. I am not a coward, but I don’t think the song brings any form of disrespect.”

The rapper admitted that rap music is not where it ought to be but there has been progress over the years. He added, “The truth is that pop music gets artistes more money and shows, unlike rap music. However, I believe there are ways around it. I don’t think it is a problem if a rapper sings but it becomes an issue when you abandon what you stand for. The only way rap music would win is when every rapper does something positive for the genre.”
