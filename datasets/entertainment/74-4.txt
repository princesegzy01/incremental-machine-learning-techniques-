I improve every day – Efe Ejeba
Olushola Ricketts

When the winner of the 2017 edition of Big Brother Naija, Efe Ejeba, released his first set of songs, he was heavily criticised by fans who felt he didn’t have what it took to do music. But that has not stopped him from putting out new music.

Ejeba told Sunday Scoop that the criticisms didn’t affect him or his music though he tried to improve every day. He said, “I don’t think the backlash I got from people has made me a better singer. It is just normal to always want to be better than you were yesterday. As an artiste, I have been growing. I don’t think there is something I am doing now that I wasn’t doing before.”

He also attributed his success to God’s grace. He said, “I think I am enjoying the grace of God. If you ask me how I grew up, I cannot tell you. You don’t determine certain things; it is just grace. All I do is to produce music every day, make different sounds and continue to grow.”

The rapper also stated that he was interested in helping emerging artistes. “I have so much interest and passion in helping people around me. I may not have so much but I have been helping people in my own little way; I don’t just make noise about it.”
