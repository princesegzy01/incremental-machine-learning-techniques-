I didn’t become a star overnight –Femi Solar
Olajide Samuel

For jasa music creator and juju maestro, Femi Solar, reaching new heights in his career wouldn’t have been possible without the help of God and those who never gave up on him.

The singer noted that it was only people who didn’t know his antecedents that referred to him as an overnight success. He said, “I have been through a lot and it is only the grace of God that has brought me this far. I am also grateful to the people who saw potential in me and never gave up on me. It is only people who don’t know anything about me that would say I just came from nowhere to get here.”

Speaking on his new single, Obajasa, which featured 9ice, the singer said, “9ice and I have been working together on a few projects, so when it was time to feature him on my single, I embraced the opportunity because I knew he was going to add so much value to the song and he truly did.”

The artiste who recently unveiled his record label and studio, Rhetotec Sounds, said having a record label and modern recording studio had been his dream for a long time. He also said his endorsement deal with Trumpy Concept, a real estate company, was a step in the right direction. He stated, “I looked at the deal critically and I felt it was good for my brand and career at this time, so I couldn’t say no to the company. I should also let you know that FS7 and Rhetotec Sounds have been rebranded to enhance the distribution of some of our works across Nigeria and even beyond.”
