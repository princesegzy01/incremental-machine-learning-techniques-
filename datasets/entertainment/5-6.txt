VIDEO: Fans react to Tiwa-Wizkid live performance in France
Nigerian music star Tiwa Savage is trending like hot cake on Twitter.

In a trending poor quality video, Tiwa is said to have had a live performance with Wizkid in France, and the clip tapers off with what looks an embrace — or, well, as some people believe, a kiss.

Many viewers conclude that it was a kiss between 39-year-old Tiwa and 29-year-old Wizkid.

See the video clip:

Because Wizkid and Tiwa kissed on stage, in Paris, Nigerians are suddenly expecting wedding IV.

Well, I have 3 things for you:

1) It was a French kiss on French soil(normal thing).

2) What happens in Paris stays in Paris.

3) Go find your own love. — Faunah (@IdyilS) October 27, 2019
