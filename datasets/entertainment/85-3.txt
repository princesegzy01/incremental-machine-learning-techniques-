Popular musician, Terry G, who is known for his crazy style of music, has said his parents still don’t like his dreadlocks even though it has been his signature hairstyle for many years.

“It was difficult for me to convince my parents to do music; I had to run away from home. They never wanted my dreadlocks and still don’t like the hairstyle; it is only my mum that fights for me. I am the first child so they wanted me to portray the way of the Lord.

“At the end of the day, we are all servants of God. Going into music wasn’t planned; Daddy Enoch Adeboye (General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God) has laid hands on me before, and he told me I was going to preach to the world. I wish social media was vibrant then. When I used to minister in the church, people fell under the anointing,” he told Saturday Beats.

He also talked about the reason why he was still an independent musician.

“I help artistes but I don’t tie them down, I prefer to help them and I don’t have to sign them on my label. I will sing more gospel songs soon; I have recorded some gospel songs already and I hope to release a gospel album one day.

“I feel so excited that other musicians are still following my path while I am alive,” he said.

Terry G used to drive a luxury car, but he said the bad roads in Lagos frustrated him until he towed his car out of Lagos

“I don’t drive my Ferrari anymore in Lagos because of the bad roads, I had to tow the car back to Abuja,” he added.
