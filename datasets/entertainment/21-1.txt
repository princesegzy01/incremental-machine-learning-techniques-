Several years after she quit her medical practice for a career in film acting, Kiki Omeili has completed a memorable cycle in the Nigerian film industry by producing her own maiden feature film, titled, Run.

The movie, which focuses on the inexhaustible story and character of Lagos, is now in the cinemas.

For Omeili, who has played different roles in Nollywood films, such as ‘Married and Living Single’, ‘Gbomo Gbomo Express’, ‘Catcher’, ‘Couple Days’ and ‘The Antique’, Run is a dream come true. The film-maker is clearly excited that the movie, which also took four years to produce, is finally out.

“I am excited that we have finished work on the movie and we are now ready to offer it to the public. It opened in cinemas on August 23,” she told our correspondent recently.

Run is the story of a hardworking young woman, who lives a dull and regimented lifestyle. She comes face to face with a situation, while running one night, which throws her life into chaos. The young woman is then left to wriggle herself out of the mess, back to her former life.

Directed by Uche Chukwu, it stars some notable Nollywood actors, such as Rotimi Salami, Kelechi Udegbe, Greg Ojefua, and comedian Owen Gee. Run is Kiki’s debut feature film as a producer.

Omeili had, in 2016, produced a short film ‘Unprotected’, which was selected for screening at the short film corner of the Cannes International Film Festival in France. The product of the University of Lagos College of Medicine once hosted the popular television reality dance show ‘Dance 234’ h had also taken part in ‘Behind The Smile’, ‘The Valley Between’, ‘Footprints’ and ‘Lekki Wives’.
