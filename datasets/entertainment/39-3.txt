Avengers’ topples ‘Avatar’ to lead all-time box office
“Avengers: Endgame,” the latest episode in the blockbuster Marvel Cinematic Universe series, has powered its way into the record books, smashing the global box office record held by “Avatar.”

Here are the top ten box office juggernauts of all-time, in a ranking which hasn’t been adjusted to take inflation into account.

1. “Avengers: Endgame” (2019) $2.7902 billion

Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo conclude a 22-movie story arc with this adventure with Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man and Co., set after the devastating events of “Avengers: Infinity War” (2018), with the universe in ruins.

2. “Avatar” (2009): $2.7897 billion

James Cameron’s cautionary tale of a paraplegic marine whose loyalties are tested when he befriends an alien tribe on a distant moon towered over its rivals for a decade.

3. “Titanic” (1997): $2.19 billion

Part saturnine elegy to doomed youth, part exaltation of the transcendent power of love, this blockbuster disaster movie, another Cameron opus, dramatized the real-life sinking in 1912 of history’s most famous ship.

4. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (2015): $2.07 billion

Three decades after the Jedi returned, the emergence of the militant First Order poses a new threat in this widely acclaimed reboot of the legendary Skywalker saga.

5. “Avengers: Infinity War” (2018): $2.05 billion

In the Russo brothers’ third foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe — after two “Captain America” movies — the Avengers must sacrifice everything in an attempt to stop “Mad Titan” Thanos killing half of all life in the universe.

6. “Jurassic World” (2015): $1.67 billion

Colin Trevorrow’s contribution to the iconic creature-feature series took audiences to a new theme park, built on the original site of Jurassic Park, where a genetically modified super-dinosaur is on a killing spree.

7. “The Avengers” (2012): $1.51 billion

This is the first of Joss Whedon’s two ensemble “Avengers” movies bringing together Earth’s mightiest warriors. In a staggering achievement, all four entries in this franchise are top ten all-time money-makers. Here, the superheroes must learn to work as a team to stop the mischievous Loki taking over the world.

8. “Fast & Furious 7” (2015): $1.51 billion

James Wan was already a big name in horror movie-making when he directed this entry in the “Fast & Furious” universe, which sees Deckard Shaw seeking revenge for his comatose brother.

9. “Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015): $1.40 billion

This entry, Whedon’s sequel to his 2012 smash hit, isn’t even the final Marvel Cinematic Universe movie on the list.

10. “Black Panther” (2018): $1.35 billion

Ryan Coogler’s movie, the fifth and final Marvel superhero blockbuster in the list, was the highest-grossing film of 2018 in North America, scored seven Oscar nominations and was hailed as a milestone in black representation on the big screen.
