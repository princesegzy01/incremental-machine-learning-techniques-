NAN reports that an Instrument Rating, in Aviation Parlance, is a qualification that pilot must have in addition to a Private Pilot or Commercial Pilot License to fly under Instrument Flight Rules.

It requires additional training and instruction beyond what is required for a private pilot certificate or commercial pilot certificate.

The check ride is divided into an oral component to ascertain that applicants understand the theory of instrument flying and an actual flight to ensure the pilot possesses the practical skills required for safe IFR flight.
