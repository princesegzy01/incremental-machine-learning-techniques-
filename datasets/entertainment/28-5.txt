WAP parades Nobert Young, others in The Barbington Family
As the country’s entertainment scene continues to expand, popular Wale Adenuga Productions seems to be waxing stronger. The evidence for this is that the producer of hits such as Papa Ajasco and Superstory is set to release a new TV drama series, titled ‘The Babington Family’.

The story centres around the titular family and Nnenna (of the Nnenna & Friends fame). In her quest to correct social ills and promote family value, she finds herself serving as a governess in the Babingtons’ home, and it becomes a roller coaster ride both inside and outside the home.

The producers describe it as a family programme with a youth bias due to the prominence of talented young acts in the series.

“It also features brilliant performances by your favourite superstars such as Olayinka Ademo (Nnenna), Vivian Anani, Nobert Young, Kunle Coker, Amaechi Muonagor, Omo Ibadan, Kalu Ikeagwu, Joke Muyiwa and other notable artistes.
