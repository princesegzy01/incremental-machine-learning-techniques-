Diane gets evicted from 2019 BBNaija show
Housemate Diane Russet has been evicted from the 2019 Big Brother Naija reality TV show.

She was evicted after the Ultimate Veto Power Holder, Frodd, picked a coin that belonged to her.

Frodd picked Dianeâ€™s gold Bet9ja coin in the final ultimate veto-power game and Biggie gave her 10 seconds to leave the house.
