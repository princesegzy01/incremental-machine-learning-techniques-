As part of a conscious effort to curb the drug abuse menace among young people in the society, social activist, Stephen Chibuzor, popularly known as Igwe Paparazzi, held the 4th edition of ‘Powerball Football Tournament’, an annual event aimed at discouraging drug abuse among young people in the society.

Speaking on the essence of the event, Chibuzor said, “Powerball Football Tournament is an annual inter-university 5-aside-football tournament that sees different universities and celebrity teams compete in a friendly atmosphere to create awareness for the prevention of drug abuse on Nigerian campuses. Drug abuse among young people has become a problem that needs to be paid attention to immediately. A group of Nigerian entertainers decided to come together to create the much-needed awareness against drug abuse on campuses, using football as a tool.”

Entertainers, including popular comedian, Akpororo; Big Brother Naija 2017 winner, Efe Ejeba; musician, Sexy Steel; Joe Boy; DJ Voyst; Junior Boy; Ossy Achievas; Bello Kreb; and Josh 2Funny, were all at the venue to feature at the tournament, which held at the Astro Turf Pitch, Federal College of Education (Technical), Akoka, alongside students from the University of Lagos, Akoka; Lagos State University, Ojo; Federal College of Education, Akoka; and Yaba College of Technology, Yaba, Lagos.
