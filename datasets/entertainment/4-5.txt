Award-winning singer, Tiwa Savage, is set to headline the 2019 Flytime music festival, which is also the 15th year anniversary of the programme.

At the five-day event, which is to hold in Lagos in December, the ‘49:99’ singer will be performing alongside other music stars such as Boyz II Men, Megan Thee Stallion, Mase and Koffee, among others.
