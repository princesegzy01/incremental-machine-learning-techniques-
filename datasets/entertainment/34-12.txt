Fashion lovers and enthusiasts will converge on the city of Lagos later in the month for the 2019 edition of the Mykmary fashion show.

The show which is to be hosted by actors, Sam Uche and Maureen Okpolo, will, according to the organisers, shine a spotlight on the city of Lagos and the nation’s fashion industry. The event will also feature some special guests including Moji Oyetayo, aka Mama Ajasco, Hakeem Rahman, Emeka Okoye, Christian Paul, Tommy Oyewole, among others.

One of the brains behind the show also told Sunday Scoop that it would be a night of fun, networking and style to represent the best of Nigeria’s fashion scene. He added that the aim of the show is to give adequate exposure to fashion designers and provide a platform for them to network.
