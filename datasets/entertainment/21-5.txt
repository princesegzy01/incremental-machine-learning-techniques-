Kim Kardashian tests positive for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis
Kim Kardashian has tested positive for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

According to physicians, lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs when the body’s immune system attacks sufferer’s own tissues and organs.

Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems, including the joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart and lungs.

Symptoms can occur in many parts of the body, doctors say.

Before her diagnosis, Kim, who also suffers from psoriasis, an autoimmune condition, had complained of aches, swollen joints and fatigue.

“She began to fear the worst as she worked full steam ahead on her career and law studies, while at the time she was also expecting her fourth child, son Psalm,” Metro had reported.

“Lately, my wrists have started to hurt again, but it’s definitely a different feeling than before. I feel this, like, in my bones,’ she reportedly said.

Expressing fear for her life, 38-year-old Kim had said, “I just am, like, freaking out.

“I have a baby on the way, I have law school. It just really can scare you when you start really thinking about how much this is gonna really change my life.”

Metro reports that, after undergoing certain tests, it was confirmed that she had tested positive for lupus antibodies as well as rheumatoid arthritis – which affects the joints and causes pain, throbbing, swelling and stiffness.

Her physician, Dr. Daniel Wallace, confirmed to her, “Your antibodies are positive for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.”

However, he confirmed that the diagnosis didn’t mean that she conclusively had the disease, as he added, “Sometimes, you can get false positives in these screenings.”

Meanwhile, her mother Kris Jenner and sisters Khloe Kardashian, and Kylie Jenner have expressed support for her.

Meanwhile, Kim said she would be finding out the test results later.
