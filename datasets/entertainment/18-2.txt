Osinbajo inspired One Nigeria – Mr Bigger
As Nigeria’s Independence Day draws near, rising music artiste, Mr Bigger (Bigger Ibekwe), has released a single, titled, One Nigeria.

He says the song is meant to rekindle and fire the spirit of unity and patriotism among Nigerians.

He said the new single was inspired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on a poster, saying, “We must move forward.”

Mr Bigger, who has been known for gospel hits, says that the latest just as the previous ones were inspired by God.

“I am a gospel artiste, I don’t just sing song for the sake of it, I do it as a result of God’s instruction. All the songs I have done over time were as a result of instructions.

“However, the idea of this particular song, One Nigeria, came the day I was passing through the Balogun area of Surulere; I saw a very big billboard with the portrait of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo with a statement, ‘We must move forward.’

“I began to ponder on the statement and then I saw the beauty in all of us moving forward together and that gave birth to the song,” the gospel artiste added.

Mr Bigger says the song is about unity and togetherness, stressing that giving a message of unity at this time when Independence Day celebration is close is a deliberate effort to pass the message of unity, patriotism, nationality and togetherness to all Nigerians to promote Nigeria in a better sphere.”

He identified leadership and not diversity of the country as major challenge affecting the nation’s unity.

He said, “The problem we have in Nigeria is not our tribal differences; it’s our leadership problem and the mindset of our leaders. China has about 374 tribes yet they are together, they surrender all to stay together as one but that is not the case in Nigeria.”

He called on Nigerians to be united.
