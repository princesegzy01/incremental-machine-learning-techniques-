Why I didn’t perform at 2019 Grammys —Seun Kuti
Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti, on Monday, revealed why he didn’t perform at the 2019 Grammy Awards, which held on Sunday night.

On his Instagram handle, he shared a video of himself on the Grammys red carpet and said that he had a “ticket mix-up”, which meant, he missed his flight and was unable to rehearse, hence, his non-perfomance at the show as earlier announced.

He went on to thank those, who stepped in for him, like the Soweto Gospel Choir and the Malian singer, Fatoumata Diawara.

He said, “First and foremost I have to say I am sorry to all the fans that tuned in to see us perform yesterday but didn’t. I had the weirdest ticket mix up in history meaning I missed my flight and the rehearsals and we couldn’t go on. Big up to Soweto Gospel choir a group that has also inspired me. @fatoumata_diawara__ for holding down our show without me. ”
