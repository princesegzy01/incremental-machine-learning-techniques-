Represented by his deputy, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, the governor noted that, “apart from the fact that Ogun State is home to very interesting artefacts and historic sites, the numerous tourist centres and businesses such as the Birikisu Sungbo Shrine, Yemoji Natural Pool, Iwasi Eco-tourism Centre, Ebute Oni Tourist Beach, Olumo Rock, Itoku Adire market, and Eruwon Golf Resort, among others, have continued to contribute immensely to the economy of our state.

“Also, since inception of our administration, we have put structures in place, not only to support these tourist activities, but to harness the potential of the tourism sector towards the successful implementation of Building Our Future Together Agenda.”
