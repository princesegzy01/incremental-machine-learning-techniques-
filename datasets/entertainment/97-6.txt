I don’t need annual concert to be relevant, wealthy – Okey Bakassi
Comedian, Okechukwu Onyegbule, aka Okey Bakassi, believes he doesn’t need to organise a yearly concert just because the likes of Ayo Makun, Alibaba and Basketmouth are doing same.

Bakassi told Sunday Scoop that unlike most comedians, he does not need to do a yearly concert to maintain relevant or make money. He said, “When you are into many things, you have to look at things you can do without. Comedians stage yearly concerts to make money and stay relevant but I don’t need to do that because everyone is doing same. I am achieving the same result with the things I’m doing. I don’t believe everyone must pass through a particular route to get to the same destination. Last year, I did a Masterclass with Okey Bakassi held at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. I also did concerts in the United Kingdom and Canada.”

The comedian added, “I still get movie roles, but when I look at my schedule, it is always hard to accommodate them. I do radio shows and TV series. I cannot lose relevance even in the movie industry unless I don’t develop myself. But, how many things can I do at the same time?”

Bakassi also says he is not the type who regrets things as he sees life as a battlefield where you win and lose some battles. He stated, “I don’t have regrets. In life, you win some things and you miss some things. When you miss, you move on; there is no time to pause and be regretting over what could have been. The truth is that there is nothing you can do about a spoilt meal,” Bakassi stated.
