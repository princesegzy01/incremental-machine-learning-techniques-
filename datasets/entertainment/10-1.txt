Budding artiste, Taiwo Paul, aka TP Touch (Orilomonext), has said that his travails on the streets are the fodder for his music career. The singer, who has been homeless at a point, told Sunday Scoop, “I have an undiluted passion for music, and I believe strongly in myself. I have passed through a lot of challenges and they have actually strengthened me. I didn’t have motherly care, though my father really tried his best to take care of me and my twin brother. At a point, we had no place to sleep, and no food to eat; we started begging on the street for money to survive.

Later on, me and my brother found ourselves in a boys’ remand home at lkeja, Lagos, and that was where I developed the confidence that I can make it in life, no matter what situations life throws at me. My music is basically to encourage people to believe in themselves, and let them know that things can change for the better at any time.”

Speaking on his latest single, This Year, the singer said, “This Year is a song to motivate and inspire all hardworking individuals, and also encourage them to believe in themselves. For all those that are working hard out there, I want to assure them that this year will not pass without them reaping the fruits of their labour.”

Describing his style of music as afro pop, Paul said he often faced the challenge of not having adequate funds to promote his music career, and was ready to accept any record deal that went through due process.
