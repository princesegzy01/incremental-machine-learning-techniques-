Budding artiste, Afuwape Taiwo, aka Teazy, who is signed to E. A. Entertainment, has released his debut single titled, Meji Meji.

The song, which is currently enjoying heavy rotation on various radio stations, is a feel good track which is bound to resonate with fans because of its groovy melody.

Teazy, who hails from Ondo State, describes himself as an afro-pop and dancehall singer.

The Mass Communication graduate of the Yaba College of Technology, Lagos, recalls that he started his music career at the age of 13, singing and playing drums in churches and live bands, alongside his twin brother, Oluwatobi (Kehinde). According to the songwriter, he developed a passion for music, through his parents who are also music lovers.

Teazy, who has taken part in various music competitions such as MTN Project Fame (2012), Glo X Factor (2013), and Ojaja Music Talent Hunt, says he is propelled by the desire to stamp his musical footprints on the world map.

The founders of the Italy-based EA Entertainment, Emmanuel and Andrew Esiemoghie (who are brothers), also say they are convinced that Teazy will break barriers because he “is a very talented, humble, ambitious and resilient young boy”.
