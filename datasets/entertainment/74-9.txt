Comic actor, John Okafor widely known as Mr Ibu, had to make a video recently to debunk a rumour about his health condition after it was reported that he was down with a stroke.

Speaking to Saturday Beats, the 57-year-old said that it was his sister, who instigated the fake news about his health.

He stated, “I don’t know what actually happened; one of my sisters was also part of the rumour mongers.

“She just opened a media house; so she is looking for a way to make her brand go viral. I feel she should have consulted me before spreading this kind of news and I would have given her another angle to explore such that it would not affect my image.

“The President of the Actors Guild of Nigeria also confirmed that I was sick and it is very funny. The only bad incident that has happened to me recently was when I was attacked in Nnewi during Christmas and I have recovered.

“I have forgiven my sister for what she did. I am alive and well, my wife was very angry over the news and wanted to take action but I told her not to do so.

“I’ve left it to God for Him to defend me.”
