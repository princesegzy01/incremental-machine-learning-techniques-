I can still make gospel music – Maheeda
Tofarati Ige

Singer, Maheeda, is called ‘Naija bad girl’ for a reason. Often posting near-nude and sensual pictures on social media, Maheeda does not hide the fact that she has had a rough past. Nurtured by the streets, she started her music career as a secular artiste, before changing to gospel music, and back to secular music. She also told Sunday Scoop that despite her reputation as a ‘bad girl’, she could still choose to sing gospel music. She said, “It is a part of my life. I might just be in the mood to make gospel music one day. As artistes, we sing about everything and anything. And it’s always good to talk about God’s love, grace and mercies in one’s life. No one is perfect or worthy, and we are all in the world. If I feel like thanking God for everything, I will! If you like, call it ‘gospel’, or say I’m not worthy; that’s not my problem. I will always be sexy and show it off.”

She stated that she took a break from music to have time for her family. “It’s true that I have been away for a long time but I don’t have any regrets. I did it for my family. I am a full-time mum and wife now. If I could go back in time to start my career again, I wouldn’t change anything; I’d just improve on some areas,” she said.
