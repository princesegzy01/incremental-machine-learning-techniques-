Few people willing to help without wanting something in return – Miss Ekiti

Winner of the 2018 beauty pageant in Ekiti State, Miss Bunmi Adegboyega, has said her environment has not encouraged her career in any way. In a chat with Saturday Beats, the beauty queen noted that her environment had been discouraging because of the belief by some people that ladies should ‘use what they have, to get what they want’.

“People say ‘uneasy lies the head that wears the crown’. There were several hurdles, valleys and numerous hills to cross. Our environment has not been encouraging because of the wrong concept of ‘use what you have to get what you want’. Just few people are ready to help without demanding anything in return.

“Others have been so terrible, frustrating and destructive. My advice to all upcoming aspirants is to believe in self reliance. They should not dehumanise themselves to win. Just like my mentor used to tell me, ‘soon, your day will surely come,’” she said.

Adegboyega also said she would use her reign to impact people in all spheres of life.

“There are a lot of projects to be executed. Some are ongoing while some are to be launched soon. Basically, we have designed a platform to care for widows in the state, visitation and presentation of gifts to orphans, ongoing quiz competition, among secondary schools in the state to ensure the state remains the ‘Home of the Elite,’” she said.
