Prayers helped me choose music as a career –Zoro
Timileyin Akinkahunsi

Musician, Owoh Chimaobi Chrismathner, widely known as Zoro, has identified the role prayers played in helping him to choose music as a career path. In an interview with Saturday Beats, the young musical artiste noted that his mother was not in support of his career when he decided to choose music.

“Prayers,” he simply said, when asked what helped him to become an artiste.

Continuing, he said, “My mum once said she wasn’t using one ‘wrapper’ to save money to send me to school for me to bring home some crap CDs for her. As a child, I wanted to become a marine engineer. I grew up in Onitsha and Enugu; it was really tough growing up during those times but God and my family had my back, so I pulled through. My life as an undergraduate wasn’t easy; sometimes, I had to leave for school by 4.30am just to get some good place to sit.”
