Tofarati Ige

Talented artiste, songwriter and producer, Ezerioha Ebuka, popularly known as Popito, is apparently firing from all cylinders since he pitched his tent with his new record label, TNBT.

The prolific music producer has produced hit songs for big names in the entertainment industry including Timaya, Skales, Davido, Orezi, Faze, Tunde Ednut, Solidstar, Cynthia Morgan, Terry Apala, Chuddy K, Morachi, Tonto Dike, Stormrex and Splash, among others.

After a successful outing with the fast tempo song, Coming Thru, Popito has released yet another potential hit, collaborating with one of Nigeriaâ€™s hottest female artistes at the moment, Teni Entertainer. The song titled Las Las is currently enjoying appreciable airplay.Copyright PUNCH.
