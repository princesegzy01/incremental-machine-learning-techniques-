A filmmaker, Tolulope Rotimi, aka Originator, and his team, got the shock of their lives on Wednesday when the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad raided their house and whisked them away like common criminals.

Although they regained their freedom after the intervention of family members and friends in the movie industry, Originator described the experience as scary. He told Sunday Scoop, “It was like a movie scene. We saw 10 armed men; we didn’t know who they were because they didn’t wear uniforms. They also put handcuffs on some of us. It was when we arrived at their office in Ikeja, Lagos, that we discovered they were SARS operatives. They said they got a tip-off that my house was a hideout for criminals. They later searched the house and didn’t find anything incriminating.”

Admitting that the building was occupied by men, he explained that everyone in the house was into filmmaking. Originator said, “I didn’t expect them to just invade the house, but there was nothing we could do since they were armed. We were taken in the morning and we gained our freedom in the evening. We were afraid but we couldn’t fight; I was just praying to God to take charge. They took money from us but it was returned later.”
