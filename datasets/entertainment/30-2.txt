Many comedy shows below expectations –Senator
Olajide Samuel

Bethel Njoku, popularly known as Senator in the Nigerian comedy industry, believes many comedy shows nowadays are below performance expectations.

He told SUNDAY SCOOP, “Having your own show does not mean you are a successful comedian. It doesn’t make you funny. Many comedy shows, these days, really fall below performance expectations. A comic only stages his own show because he wants to reach out more to his fan base. What that means is that he is doing the five minutes feature in other people’s event but he has enough time to express himself at his own show.”

The comedian who is a regular face on the popular television series, My Flatmates, said that his acting talent wasn’t a new development.

“I studied Theatre and Performing Arts at the University of Jos, so, it’s nothing new to me. I only concentrated on stand-up comedy and master of ceremonies because they take lesser time and rake in more money.”

Sharing some of the lessons marriage has taught him, Senator said, “Marriage has its uniqueness. It is a life journey. It’s normal to have different experiences. Marriage has taught me more about issues of communication and sacrifice.”
