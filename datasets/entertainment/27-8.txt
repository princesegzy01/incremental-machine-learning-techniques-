Why I comment on national issues –I Go Dye
Olajide Samuel

Francis Agoda, aka, I Go Dye , is undoubtedly one of the most vocal Nigerian entertainers. The stand-up comedian, who often comments on national issues on his Instagram page, has shared what he learnt from the 2019 presidential election.

In an encounter with SATURDAY BEATS, the outspoken entertainer said, “The biggest lesson I have learnt this year is that when God is with you, no one can stop you from achieving your desires. This is based on the outcome of the last presidential elections in Nigeria.”

On what drives him to comment on national issues, I Go Dye , who once wrote an open letter to President Buhari, said, “I am driven by the love for my country and the responsibility to make the world a better place than I met it.”

The Delta State-born comedian also debunked claims that he doesn’t attend comedy shows organised by his colleagues. “I attend comedy shows organised by my colleagues. I may not be everywhere but obviously, I function,” he said.
