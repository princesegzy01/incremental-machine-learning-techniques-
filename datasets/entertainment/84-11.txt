There is so much that one can do with a mobile phone these days. It can be a clock, music player, diary and many other things.

A few days ago, a trend, #HealingInAPhone, stirred up diverse conversations on social media. Going by feelers online, Sunday Scoop learnt that something big is about to happen.

Social media influencers such as Yaw, BigTimi, Pamilerin, and others have joined the conversation which has already seen different memes creatively used by users on Twitter.

Although it is not yet clear what the hashtag is really about, tweets by some of the influencers suggest that it would be worth the wait to find out.

A telemedicine platform, @seekmedapp, tweeted, “We are super excited about #HealingInAPhone and we can’t wait to tell you all what it is about. Keep the guesses coming.”

Meanwhile, Yaw wrote, “The world keeps evolving. Imagine getting HealingInAPhone.”

PR practitioner, BigTimi, simply tweeted, “It’d be nice to have #HealingInAPhone though. I’d just take my phone and receive healing whenever and wherever.”
