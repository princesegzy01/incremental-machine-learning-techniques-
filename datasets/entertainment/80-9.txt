Tito.Dafire unveils new studio
Uduak Peters, aka Tito.Dafire, after releasing an album titled, One Kiss, featuring Beenieman, Wouter Kellerman and Fela Kuti, recently held a live unplugged session where he unveiled his new music studio.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the edifice, FireHits Rehearsal Studio, in Lagos, Tito.Dafire described it as a baby of the future. He stated, “When I had to perform in South Africa with Wouter Kellerman, I dreamt about having an uncommon live music rehearsal ambience where music and passion can meet. This shouldn’t be just for me but for the industry. This studio will take me and every music artiste a notch higher and a touch closer to inspiring live music.”

At the event, Tito.Dafire performed songs off his new album such as Dream Come True, One Kiss and Tea No Sugar. He added, “FireHits is now open to the public, and my tour dates will be announced in the next few days. I thank all my fans for supporting my new album.”
