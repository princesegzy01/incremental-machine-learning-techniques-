Actor, Prince Iyke Olisa, raised not quite a few eyebrows when he recently shot two movies, Snake Mother and Son of Python. The two films featured a lot of snakes and some insinuated that the movies might have spiritual connotation.

However, in a chat with Sunday Scoop, Olisa said he was only driven by the urge to tell unique stories. He stated, “Someone brought the script to me and after I studied it, I liked it. Every movie has an inspiration. I was not really focused on the use of snakes but the interesting story behind it.

“Every filmmaker has his or her own audience. You must know the people you are making any particular movie for; if not, you may end up getting lost in the crowd. I have identified my audience and they like my kind of movies.”

Explaining the messages the two movies aimed to pass, Olisa stated, “In Son of Python, a tyrant, terrorising a community due to his greed, was brought down by an ordinary man who sought for help from higher spiritual powers. He ended up liberating the community and brought peace and happiness to his people, while the tyrant was punished.

“Snake Mother teaches that sometimes, what is killing you lives within you. A man wiped out his elder brother’s family to take over his throne. But unluckily for him, the brother’s son didn’t die, and with the help of his mother, who had turned to a python, he was able to fight his wicked uncle and reclaim the throne.”
