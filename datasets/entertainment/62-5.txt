I want to inspire other albinos, says Whiteman
Omotore Adebayo, aka, Whiteman, is proud of the colour of his skin regardless of whatever anyone thinks about albinos.

The singer, who is signed to Money Making Machine Gang, told our correspondent that he had an undying passion for music. He stated, “I understand the competitive nature of the music industry but I am ready for the challenge. I want to be a role model for albinos who are hiding their talents because of their skin colour.

Whiteman explained that he had signed a five-year contract with his record company. He said, “I see myself and my record company as one big family. I am also comfortable with the terms of my contract.”
