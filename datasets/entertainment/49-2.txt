Up and coming singer, Mayowa Usman, aka Usman Trips, says his new song, Sade, doesn’t share similarities with Adekunle God’s hit song, Sade, beyond the title.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, Trips said, “Zlatan Ibile recently released a song, titled, This Year, and Jaywon has a song with the same title too. If you listen to my song and Adekunle’s own, the beat and lyrics are completely different. I named my song Sade because that’s the name of the girl who inspired it.”

The graduate of psychology also explained that he didn’t just sing about women. “My EP is ready and there are 13 tracks on it. I sing about my experience and experiences of people around me. I also have a track titled, Opposite Side, where I sampled the late Fela,” he said.

Trips said while he was passionate about music, he hoped to make money from it too. He stated, “I have always been passionate about music but one should be able to make money from his or her songs. My intention is to make money from music eventually. I started singing at the age 16 after my secondary school education. I released my first official single in 2015 while I was in Ghana.”
