Dayo Adeola

Following the success of its drama series, ‘The Men’s Club’, REDTV has launched its own chat show, ‘Red Hot Topics’. The show follows a panel of young people discussing current and hot topics that affect everyday life. They will openly and frankly touch on topics ranging from equality to infidelity, sex, relationships, honour, business and other issues.

Produced on set in the studios of REDTV, the show will defy the norms and break down all barriers. The boys — TJ, Ihechi, OD, Tayo, Ola, Martin and Farouq, and the girls — Lolo, Ada, Coco, Bukky and Ariyiike are stunning, stylish, suave and ready to talk. If it’s honest, they will tell it. If it is taboo, they will uncover it. But most of all, if it’s forbidden and unchartered, – they will go all the way and bring the heat!

Speaking on the series, the executive producer of the Show, Bola Atta, said, “Red Hot Topics is a chat show that will change how people think and act, in a positive way. The conversations of the vibrant youths are as essential as they are interesting and engaging. The cast is fun, honest and fresh, all speaking straight from the heart, with no holds barred.”
