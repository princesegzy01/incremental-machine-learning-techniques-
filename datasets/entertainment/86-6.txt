Budding singer, Innocent Obinani, aka E-Don, has started the year on a romantic note by releasing the video of his hit song, Janet. The video, which was directed by Iyke Okogwu Films, was shot in Houston, USA.

The singer, who is signed to Edoc Entertainment, told Sunday Scoop that Janet, produced by Frankie Free, came ‘from the depth of his heart’. “I believe that love is one of the greatest forces on earth. It is at the very core of our being as human beings. Love is a beautiful thing and this song is basically about a guy who sheds his insecurities and bares his mind to the woman he loves. I think that a lot of guys will relate with the song. It came from the depth of my heart and it is a gift to the womenfolk,” he said.
