That curvaceous actress, Amara Maduka, has one of the biggest backsides in the Nigerian entertainment industry is not in doubt.

The Anambra State-born role interpreter, who has featured in movies such as ‘Okrika’, and ‘Maduka’s Daughter’, said curvy women are better lovers.

In a chat with Saturday Beats, the sensually crafted and daring actress said, “It’s not up for debate. I think it’s an established fact that curvy women are better lovers and great at sex. They are the juiciest so, technically, they’re the sweetest”.

Maduka who loves to flaunt her feminine assets also stated that most men feel threatened by sex toys.

She said, “The controversy surrounding sex toys is really unnecessary to me. Men act like the toys are going to replace them but I don’t think it would. Eventually, a woman will need the warmth of a man and the toys won’t provide that. Toys are basically for emergency situations. When the human isn’t available and a girl has to help herself, a sex toy comes in handy.

“It can also be useful when you just want to stay of relationships and put your life together. I will advise women to use sex toys. Instead of having to sleep with different men for satisfaction, you can give yourself same and in most cases, better orgasm.”
