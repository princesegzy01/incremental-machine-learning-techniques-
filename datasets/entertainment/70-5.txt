A new movie, Shadow Parties, has received a major boost with the addition of veteran actress, Sola Sobowale, and two foreign actors to the cast.

Produced and directed by Yemi Amodu, the communal clash-themed movie has reached the post-production stage. But the producer had to add a new twist to the movie, hence the introduction of the energetic Sola Sobowale, Hafiz Oyetoro, Magdelena Korpas, and Lucien Morgan. Omolola Jalade-Ekeinde has also returned to set with the new cast.

Morgan is an actor and producer known for movies such as An American Werewolf in London, Return of the Don and Theft Unexpected. Korpas, on the other hand, is a film and stage actress based in Paris but born in Gdansk, Poland.

Shot in Lagos, Ibadan and Akure, Shadow Parties is a story about Aremu (Ken Erics) who hails from Aje, a town close to Iludun, where his wife, Arike (Toyin Abraham), was born. Known for fratricidal wars, which have claimed the lives of Arikeâ€™s parents, the towns begin to fight after the kinsmen of Aremu burns his wife, claiming she is an enemy.

Other actors in the movie include Segun Arinze, Prince Jide Kosoko, Ken Erics, Toyin Abraham, Saidi Balogun, Sola Kosoko, Rotimi Salami, and Yemi Blaq.

Shadow Parties will start showing in cinemas by August.
