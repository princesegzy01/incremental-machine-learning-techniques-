BBNaija 4: Elozonam joins Ike in double eviction night
Elozonam Ogbolu has become the second housemate to be evicted from BBNaija in a night of double eviction on the 91st day of the reality TV show.

As related by Biggie, since coming into the Big Brother House in the fifth week, Elozonam had had an interesting journey.

“Baby Hercules sure gave us some drama in his relationship and Arena Games performance,” Biggie said.

Elozonam is a 33-year-old self-employed television producer.

“He spent too much time at school, but this taught him to keep it moving,” BBNaija said in his bio.

“The highest point in his life was when he quit his job to start his company.

“When it’s time to press the ‘pause’ button on life, he likes to drive around in a beautiful car,” the bio added.

“What irritates you most about other people,” Elozonam was asked; and he responded, ” Body odour, talkativeness.”

Asked what he would do with the prize money, he answered, “I will produce a feature film.”

On why he would be fans’ favourite, he said, “They will like me because I’m playful. I think I’m funny and my looks.”

Here’s his journey through the Biggie’s House:
