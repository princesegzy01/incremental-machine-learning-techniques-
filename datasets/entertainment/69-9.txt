It was recently reported that actress, Wumi Toriola, who is allegedly pregnant, went with her colleague, Seyi Edun, to beat up an up-and-coming actress, Adewala Kofoworola, for disrespecting them. In a video that circulated widely on social media, Adewala was seen being beaten by two ladies (though their faces weren’t visible). In another clip, Adewala knelt on the floor while some men admonished her for using her Instagram page to write derogatory things about people. Shortly after the videos surfaced online, Adewala also went on her Instagram page to apologise. She wrote, “I apologise for what I said to @i­_am­­_shai (Seyi Edun) on Instagram that ‘where Seyi Edun wan see belle? Una don forget say she be Lord of the rings? (How does Seyi Edun want to get pregnant?’ Have you forgotten she is lord of the rings). Please forgive me. It wouldn’t repeat itself again.”

However, when Sunday Scoop spoke with Toriola, she refused to talk much about the incident, claiming that the case is now with the police. She said, “How does it sound to you that I went with a colleague to beat up someone? It is not every news you should carry; you can ignore some. The situation (case) is actually with the police; so, it is beyond what you see. It is in the hands of the law now.”

On what she has been up to career-wise, Toriola said, “I have just been on a low key, trying to get better.”
