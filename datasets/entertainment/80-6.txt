Young, vibrant and talented, Yannick Philppe is not ready to let this guard down and be enveloped by the struggles of an up and coming act.

The budding artiste is also an actor and comedian. Speaking on his career, he said, “I studied filmmaking at Eicar Film School, Paris. I also studied Acting for TV and Film at the London Media Academy, United Kingdom. I acted the lead role in a Nigerian movie titled, Invisible Men. The movie was nominated for Best Movie at the British Urban Film festival award.”

On what inspired him to get into the entertainment industry, Phillipe said, “I was inspired to join the industry by artistes such as Terry Tha Rapman, Mode 9, 2face and Asa, among others.”

Speaking on the challenges he had faced as an up and coming act, Phillipe stated that the industry was tough and unfriendly for a rookie. “If you are not popular, no one wants to know you until you ‘blow’. You have to do many free shows to market yourself and it has not been easy on me at all. For now, I’m under my own record label, Yannick Philippe Music Group. But, if I get a better offer from an established record label, I’ll jump at it,” he said.
