Jenifa’s Diary actress, Jumoke Aderounmu, says one of her scariest moments was when a male fan tailed her to her house. Recounting the encounter to Sunday Scoop, she said, “Crazy experiences with male fans are constant, but I think the most creepy was when a guy saw me walking on my street (when I was living at Ogba, Lagos) and tailed me to my house. He got to my door, then said, ‘Hi Esther (the name of her character in Jenifa’s Diary), I’ve been following you to greet you and have your number’. It was definitely one of the scariest moments of my stay in that area. I don’t appreciate anyone creeping on me; it’s not cool.”

Speaking on her experience as part of the cast of Jenifa’s Diary and how she was able to interpret her role, Aderounmu said, “For me, the highlight of being a part of that series is the love I get from people, and my fan base also increased. I am forever grateful for the opportunity to be on the show. All the roles I’ve played in my career have had different challenges for different reasons. Esther was quite taxing at first but I got more comfortable as I grew with her. Right now, I don’t really have any new challenge in my career. I believe that whatever comes my way is part of the process; so, I keep pushing and moving.”

Aderounmu, who is currently working on a film titled, When Love is Not Enough (Lafemmeanjola), stated that her favourite part of her body were her legs and she was “entirely grateful to God for it.”
