While the best of the entertainment industry was busy with the Headies awards, so much was going down behind the scenes on the red carpet. Toforati Ige brings you some of the juicy happenings at the 2019 Headies awards that you may have missed.

Gordons stepped out looking like an Arabian ‘gangster’. Super excited, he made jokes with the crowd as they hailed him, perhaps expecting some giveaway…lol. He gladly disappointed them…chai

Pretty Mike was looking like a modern-day Rayden. With him is his friend (and queen?) Toyin Lawani, aka Tiannah.

The former BBN housemate was practically mobbed as many people wanted to take pictures with her. However, her bouncer was just a step away to keep unruly hands at bay.
