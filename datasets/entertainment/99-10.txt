I haven’t taken off my earrings since 2014 – Teddy A
Olushola Ricketts

Former Big Brother Naija contestant, Tope Adenibuyan, aka Teddy A, cuts a picture of a man most Nigerian parents will tell their female children to stay away from. He has tattoos, wears dreadlocks and uses earrings.

But in an encounter with Sunday Scoop, Teddy A said despite his ‘bad boy’ looks, he had never been harassed by the police. He stated, “I have never been harassed by the police and I will not. I have about 15 tattoos and they are all symbolic. The most symbolic tattoo on my body is that of a baby in the cloud; I made it when I was expecting my son. I have been keeping my dreadlocks since November 2015 and I don’t plan to cut it anytime soon. My earrings are quite expensive; I have had them since 2014 and I have never taken them off.”

Although he was raised by a single mum, the singer said he had no hatred for his dad. He said, “I was raised by a single mum and I am very close to her, but I don’t feel any resentment for my dad. If you have issues with your dad, it doesn’t have to be because of your mum. Every man has a story; every relationship has a story. Whenever there are issues between parents, I think you need to find out what happened and hear the story from both sides.”
