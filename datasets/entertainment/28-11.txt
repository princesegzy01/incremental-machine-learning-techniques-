Chux Ohai



Blackface has warned fellow members of the defunct Plantashun Boiz, Tuface Idibia and Faze, against performing songs belonging to the erstwhile music group.

The artiste in a statement posted on his Instagram page on Monday claimed that his ex-band mates had been performing the group’s recorded songs at events without rehearsals and proper preparation. He asked them to avoid doing further harm to the image of the Plantashun Boiz and to focus on their own songs.

Blackface, who has been reportedly engaged in some altercations with Tuface on copyright issues for some time, allegedly got his lawyers to serve his ex-band mates and Ruggedman a notice of an impending copyright violation, ahead of a concert tagged, The Foundation Concert and Awards’ amd scheduled to take place on September 21, 2019.

The notice, which was addressed to Ruggedman, read in part, “Your promotional materials have indicated that Messrs. Innocent Dibia (alias 2baba) and Chibuzor Orji (alias Faze) are both scheduled to perform at the said concert.

“As you are aware, both performers are former band mates of our client and they co-authored and released numerous well known songs together under the band, Plantashun Boiz. Kindly be informed that copyright over these songs remains jointly vested with our client.

“You are therefore notified that the performance of any Plantashun Boiz song at your concert without our client’s approval will constitute an infringement on our client’s registered copyright.”
