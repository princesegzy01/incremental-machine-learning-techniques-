Only three copies of my first album were sold –Alaba Ultimate
Alaba Ultimate is a musician who does Juju music among other genres. The singer has been doing what he loves most, singing and entertaining people for over 20 years.

Based in New York, United States, the father of three who leads the New York Ultimate Band, is set to release his sophomore album titled, Breakthrough.

In a chat with Saturday Beats, he revealed that his first album was released about 24 years ago and only sold three copies. “Before I left Nigeria over 20 years ago, I released an album, ‘P’egan Re’. My expectation was so high because I wanted the world to hear my music. Sadly, I only sold three copies and that shook my faith. I believe in God and in what I do as a musician but that really got to me. I vowed that I would not release an album again and that I would stick to doing my life band gigs and giving the people what they want instead.

“Over the years, whenever I travelled around the world, people kept asking if I would release an album. I kept telling them that I would release an album. Then one day, my wife told me that I should not be discouraged by my first outing. I decided to listen to her and I thank God that I did,” he said.

The singer was quick to thank his wife for her support all through the years while explaining that his success story would have been incomplete without her.

“I am based in New York, US, but I come to Nigeria virtually every month to perform. I have a supportive wife and we have sacrificed so much to get to where we are today. The reason I can be travelling around the world is because I have a support system that works for me. I thank God for the wife he gave me,” he said.
