His lawyers said this in Pulse news that instead of moving him to a number of floors that are available outside of general population.

The Bureau of Prison moved Kelly to “the most restrictive floor,” in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Chicago where he is been held.

Recently, R.Kelly was hit with fresh sex crime charges by the court and has since been held in prison custody awaiting trial.

The Bureau of Prisons says R.Kelly’s solitary confinement is because of his celebrity status and the nature of the charges.
