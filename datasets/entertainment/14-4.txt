House of Ratty Entertainment artiste, Eddy Ratty, has released a new song titled, We Be One, a socio-conscious tune that preaches peace, unity and hope. The mid-tempo song, produced by OBD, enjoins African leaders to make the safety and welfare of their citizens a priority.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, the singer said, “The song is the true message of hope and peace in Africa. I wrote and sang it from a place of strong emotions and love for Africa. I believe that Africa is one and love is all that will make the continent great.”
