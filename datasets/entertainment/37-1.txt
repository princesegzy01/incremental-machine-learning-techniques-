She revealed she had been invited to an event at a hotel in the south of France but wasn’t allowed in because of the colour of her skin.

Campbell said, “I was recently in a city in the south of France, at the time of the Cannes Film Festival, where I was invited to participate in an event in a hotel whose name I will not mention. They did not want to let my friend and I in because of the colour of my skin. The guy at the entrance pretended that the place was complete. But he let other people pass.”

She added, “It is for these kinds of shocking moments that I will continue to express myself and make myself heard.”
