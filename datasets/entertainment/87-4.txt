Baba Suwe receives N10m donation from philanthropist
Less than two weeks after calling for financial assistance from Nigerians, ailing comic actor, Babatunde Omidina, aka Baba Suwe, is almost set to travel out of the country for medical treatment.

The actor, who is currently on admission at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi Araba, courtesy of the Federal Ministry of Health, received a N10m donation and a return ticket from a Nigerian philanthropist based in the United Kingdom and founder of the Love of Christ Generation Church (Cherubim and Seraphim), Rev. Esther Ajayi, through a popular filmmaker, Gbenga Adewusi.

According to a source close to the Baba Suwe, the ministry of health’s intervention was driven by the urgency of his need. “The purpose of his admission to LUTH is to stabilise him before he can travel. The Federal Ministry of Health is currently supervising his examination and evaluation, as well as travel arrangements,” the source said.
