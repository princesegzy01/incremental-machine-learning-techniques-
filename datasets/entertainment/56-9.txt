The recently concluded African Drum Festival in Ogun State showcased the rich cultural heritage of the different ethnic groups in Nigeria through dance, exhibitions, music, and drums.

The annual event, which is in its fourth edition, witnessed visitors from Africa as well as places like Haiti, the USA, Italy, Cuba, Burkina Faso, etc., and the event was sponsored by Information and Communications Technology company, MTN. It was gathered that this year’s African Drum Festival had more than 5,000 attendees.

Last year, the event had a rich array of personalities in attendance, from politicians to traditional rulers, celebrities and people from the private sector.

Some of the foreigners who attended were thrilled by the displays at the festival and also by the state’s rich geography, especially the rocks surrounding the city.

“The people are lovely and accommodating,” Jeff, an American tourist visiting Nigeria for the first time, said.

Jeff promised to be back next year with his family and friends, saying, “It will be special to experience this beautiful culture with my family.”

Now, Jeff has become an advocate for the Nigerian culture and he certainly will be talking about his trip when he gets back to America. You can guess that he’s not the only one; other tourists will also have a thing or two to say about the festival in Ogun, Nigeria. Therefore, it is believed such will ultimately lead to an increase in revenue generation and growth.
