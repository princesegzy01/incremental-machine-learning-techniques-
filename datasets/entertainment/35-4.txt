Actor, Mustapha Solagbade, has said people in the movie industry are not always straightforward with one another. In a chat with Saturday Beats, he said, “There’s a lot of fake love and ‘eye service’ in the movie industry. Backbiting is now seen as a normal thing in the industry. People would say one thing in your presence, and say another thing behind you. If someone has true love for you, you would be able to identify the person. Meanwhile, some people would love you but they wouldn’t show it. It is only when they have the opportunity to come around you that you’ll know that they love you.”

The ‘Ewa’ actor also maintained that marriage had made him more disciplined. He stated, “Now that I’m married, I’m more disciplined. Before I got married, I was disciplined too but not as much as now. I am always scared of women. We can be friends and talk at length but when it becomes something else, I run. I thank God for the type of woman I got married. She is disciplined. There are some things I pay attention to that she cautions me about. She often reminds me that I’m a married man and a celebrity. She is always trying to protect me.”
