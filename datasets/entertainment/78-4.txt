Olushola Ricketts

Ishaya Bako’s political thriller, 4th Republic, will start showing in Nigerian cinemas from April 12.

Starring Kate Henshaw as Mabel King, a governorship candidate, the film follows a hotly contested election and one woman’s quest to take back the seat she believes she rightfully won against all odds.

Bako said 4th Republic explored the dynamics of politics in today’s Nigeria. He stated, “There are many factors at play, such as the violence that mars our polls, the new trend of fighting for justice at the tribunals and the roles society assigns to women who seek powerful positions.”
