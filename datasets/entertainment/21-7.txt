Genevieve-Lynxxx ‘suggestive’ photo sends fans talking
Nollywood classy actress Genevieve Nnaji is trending on Twitter!

The multi-talented actress has been photographed and also videoed with another talent, Lynxxx, in what many of their fans and social media followers are interpreting to be a love affair.

Music star, Tiwa Savage, didn’t seem to help matters as she Instagrammed her compliments “fine people” on Sunday when Lynxxx posted the ‘suggestive’ photo of him and Genevieve on his Instagram handle.

Hip-hop recording artist and entrepreneur, Chukie Edozien, better known by his stage name Lynxxx, made his debut in the Nigerian music in 2010 when he released his studio album This is Lynxxx and went on to become the first Nigerian artist to be endorsed by the global brand Pepsi.

The originator of Jollof Musik — a genre he describes as “an artful blend of music to create great music,” is the only son of Chief John D. Edozien, a former deputy governor of old Bendel State.

His Wiki citation states that he attended Corona Primary School Ikoyi, Lagos, and went on to study at Kings College Lagos for his secondary school education.

He attended the University of Hull in the United Kingdom, where he obtained a degree in Business, Economics and Marketing.

“After ten years of behind-the-scenes work in the music industry, Lynxxx made his debut as a recording artist in December 2009, with the release of his first official single, Change your Parade, produced by Syndik8 in-house producer and partner, IKON.

“The single received a lot of radio airplay and was popular in nightclubs, which helped Lynxxx cultivate a significant fan base through online media,” his citation says.
