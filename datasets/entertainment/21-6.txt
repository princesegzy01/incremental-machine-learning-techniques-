Veteran musician, Sir Shina Peters, over the weekend, fell down while dancing at his daughter’s wedding in Bristol, UK.

The video of the fall, which had gone viral was shared on Instagram by serial entrepreneur, Toyin Lawani, who is also his stepdaughter.

Sir Peters fell down while dancing popular “gbese” dance step and was helped to his feet by his in-law, the father of the groom. The fall drew laughter from guests at the event but they cheered him on.

Lawani captioned the video, “I know a lot of people have this video from my sister’s wedding in UK yesterday (Saturday), so I will post it here. We cool like that, you can’t mock us ❤️Fall or no fall, you are a living legend, dad @sirshinapeters. You came through for my sister, your child, our last born from my mom 💁 To those asking, so he’s my stepdad and for that, I will (be) forevermore grateful. You are the best dad ever. All I wish was for mom to be here to see her little girl get married 😭 We had a blast. We brought our A-game to the wedding.”

She jokingly warned the groom that her sister would no longer be welcome, if he decides to return her, for the trouble that Sir Shina Peters had gone through.

Lawani said, “If you return her, we won’t take her back. See all the wahala you put our dada through. Which kind of father-of-the-bride to father-of-the-groom dance is this?”
