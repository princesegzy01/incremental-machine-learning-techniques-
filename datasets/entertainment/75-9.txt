Actress Felicity Huffman pleads guilty in college admissions scandal
Actress Felicity Huffman and a dozen other parents agreed on Monday to plead guilty to using bribery to get their children into prestigious universities.

Huffman, 56, best known for her role in the “Desperate Housewives” series, agreed to plead guilty to paying $15,000 to help her eldest daughter get better scores on the SAT college entrance exam, the Massachusetts Department of Justice said in a statement.

Huffman’s equally famous husband, actor William H. Macy, was not charged in connection with the college admissions scandal.

The Massachusetts Department of Justice said that in addition to Huffman, another dozen parents charged in the case had also agreed to plead guilty.

Huffman could face a maximum of up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit mail fraud but is not expected to receive such a stiff sentence.

Another well-known actress, Lori Loughlin, known for her role on “Full House,” has also been charged in the case but did not enter a plea on Monday.

The actresses were the most famous of the 50 people indicted in a scam to help children of the American elite gain entry into top US colleges.

Some of the other parents involved were CEOs or partners in major law firms.

The ringleader behind the scam, William “Rick” Singer, who authorities say was paid about $25 million dollars to bribe coaches and university administrators, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with authorities.
