Jaywon preaches hard work in Aje
Tofarati Ige

Singer, Jaywon, has started the year on quite an inspirational note. The singer, who had a busy 2018, recently released a new single, Aje, which harps on the importance of hard work.

Revealing the inspiration behind the song, Jaywon said, “Our lively society is gradually losing its essence as negative thoughts of suicide have taken over the air, with many lives lost. On the song, I spoke about the importance of not giving up on ones dream as committing suicide is not the way. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel. I just want to inspire my fans so that they would remember that there is dignity in labour. I foresee that 2019 will be a great year.”
