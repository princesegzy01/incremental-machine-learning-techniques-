I still miss infinity – Kenny K’ore
Olajide Samuel

Kehinde Akinbode, fondly called Kenny K’ore, broke into the Nigerian music industry as the lead singer of the defunct gospel music collective, Infinity.

The singer, who recently clocked 40, noted that he has learnt some lessons over the years. In a chat with SUNDAY SCOOP, K’ore stated, “I have learnt that human control is an illusion. God reigns in the affairs of man and He has the final say.”

Going down memory lane, K’ore who wrote the hit song, Olori Oko, years back revealed why he cried when he decided to leave Infinity. “I cried because they were my comfort zone. They were not just my colleagues, but friends for 11 years. I knew I would miss them, and I still miss them,” he stated.

On if his expectations had been met at 40, the talented vocalist said, “All my expectations are far from being met. I used to think that being a man of faith was how God would keep adding to the fulfillment of my heart desires. However, I have come to realise that He is taking me away from all my desires until only His remains. The bottom line is that nothing is as fulfilling as having God as your reward.”

Speaking on his unpopular opinions on social media which often draw criticisms, K’ore said he was not bothered about being misconstrued. He added, “They misunderstood Jesus, so who am I?”
