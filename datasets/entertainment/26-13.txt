When you think of the trending songs ‘tearing’ up dance halls across the country, Joeboy’s Baby will definitely make the cut.

The rising singer who works with Mr Eazi’s Banku Music recounted to Sunday Scoop how he was discovered. He recalled, “I had done a cover of Ed Sheeran’s song, Shape of You. My friend sent it to Mr Eazi on Instagram. He then followed me and we eventually met. Soon after, he started mentoring me.”

Speaking on the contributions Mr Eazi has made to his career, the singer stated, “Mr Eazi inspires me in many ways, especially on how to handle the business side of my music.”

On what inspired the groovy tune, Baby, Joeboy said, “The song was inspired by my friend who had feelings for a girl but the feeling wasn’t reciprocated. I got the beat from the producer, Dera, and in 45 minutes, we were done with recording the song.”

The handsome entertainer who gets loads of attention from his female fans stated that a fan once asked if she could marry his picture. “One of the weirdest messages I have ever got was from a fan who said she would love to marry my picture.”
