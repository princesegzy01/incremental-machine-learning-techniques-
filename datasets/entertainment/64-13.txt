I’m not interested in politics, I don’t want to die – Grace Ama
Olushola Ricketts

Actress, Grace Ama, has explained why she has shunned politics despite the fact that she thinks the government doesn’t have the interest of Nollywood at heart.

In an encounter with Sunday Scoop, Ama said she wouldn’t go into politics in Nigeria because she was not ready to die. She stated, “I wouldn’t discourage my colleagues in politics but I don’t have an interest in Nigerian politics. If an individual can play the game, he or she can go ahead. As for me, my life is sweet and I am not ready to die.”

She also pointed out that she wasn’t supporting any party. “I can change my mind later in the future and become a member of a political party but it is not on my mind at the moment. Politics in Nigeria is a do-or-die affair,” he added.

Ama lamented that the government only remembered Nollywood when elections were drawing near. She said, “In Nollywood, we hardly get any form of support from the government. We make things happen individually but we cannot do it alone. Nollywood contributes a lot to the Nigerian economy; so, the government shouldn’t just use us for campaigns during elections. Once the government gets involved, actors will make money and live good lives.”

The actress stated that her passion for acting was the only thing that had kept her in the industry. She said, “There is no money in acting but I pray things would get better.”
