Self-styled ‘Area Fada’, musician and activist, Charles Oputa, popularly known as ‘Charly Boy’, is set to perform at the 2019 annual Felabration fiesta, a week-long celebration of the life and times Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, at the New Afrika Shrine in Lagos.

According to the News Agency of Nigeria, Charly Boy indicated in a video shared on the social media on Tuesday that he would perform alongside other artistes at the grand-finale of the fiesta.

The 68-year-old musician, who released his debut highlife album over three decades ago and recently returned to the stage, will be dedicating his performance to the memory of the late music icon and his ideas.

The former President of the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria also said he would present his latest songs during the show.

He said, “Make a date with me, alongside other great Nigerian artistes on Sunday Oct. 20, as we all gather together to give honour to whom honour is due, the legendary baba Fela Anikulapo-Kuti. Come listen to my new tunes as we all gather to find a cure to our mumu.”

Charly Boy had earlier told NAN that he planned to use music as a tool to inspire ordinary Nigerians, especially youths, to realise that power truly belongs to them.

“Music has been my age-long passion, and this time I am using it to awake the consciousness of all Nigerians, no matter where they are, towards building the country they desire,” he was quoted to have said.
