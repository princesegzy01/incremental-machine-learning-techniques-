For five minutes, ‘The Icons’ and team ‘Cruisetopia’ were Tasked to a Challenge which involved each and every team member’s participation, including the head of the house, Esther.

There were two marked rectangular boxes for each team, each rectangular box had a large bucket of coloured water and ten small silver cups.

The teams were required to fill as much of the silver cups as possible in the frame of five minutes.

The Challenge involved the Housemates climbing Biggie’s ‘obstacles’. Biggie had some deliberate ‘steps’ obstacle on the course to tighten the game.

Using their carefully thought out strategies, each team had to fill the silver cups one at a time.

Following Biggie’s rules, each cup had to be filled to the brim before the team could proceed to the next cup – all to be done within the marked box.

For this Challenge, teaspoons were provided for the purpose of transporting the water.
