Her deal with UMG makes her the first Nigerian female act to be signed to the label.

In 2018, she made history by being the first female to be awarded the Best African Act at the MTV European Music Awards.

That same year, she became the first African female act to sell out London’s Indig02.

In December 2018, she was picked by Coldplay’s lead singer Chris Martin to perform alongside Beyonce, Ed Sheeran and Jay Z live at the Global Citizen Festival in Johannesburg to a 70,000 audience in celebration of the centenary of Nelson Mandela’s birth.
