The Chairman of Music Publisher Association of Nigeria, Olumide Mustapha, has petitioned the Nigeria Copyright Commission over the state of the music publishing business in Nigeria.

Mustapha said this on Thursday in Lagos at a Townhall meeting organised by MPAN.

According to Mustapha, four sections of petitions that will be submitted at the NCC office were signed by the attendees during the meeting.

“We presented four petitions to all the attendees and those petitions cover areas we’ll forward to the Copyright Commission. We are confident we’ll have a significant impact in the decision making of how to resolve this issue in the industry after meeting the commission,” he said.

The petition that reads in part says, “That the Nigerian Copyright Commission issues a directive to all collating society in the music industry to allocate no less than 60% of gross royalties collected per annum for specific distribution for a period of three years after which a further directive and/or shall be passed limiting general distribution to a maximum of 10 per cent of gross royalties collected per annum.”

Also speaking at the event, the secretary of MPAN, Isioma Idigbe, urged the government to produce a decent environment for regulation of activities.

She said, “Government is always important in anything we do in Nigeria. However, this is a private initiative, but it still needs the support of the government. Not necessarily financial support but creating the right kind of environment and to present an opportunity for a body like ours.”
