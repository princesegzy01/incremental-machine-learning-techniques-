Hollywood actor Brad Pitt has been spotted at ex-wife Jennifer Aniston’s 50th birthday party.

Aniston marked her 50th birthday with a party at the Sunset Tower Hotel in Los Angeles on Saturday, with ex-husband Brad Pitt in attendance, according to People magazine.

“Pitt made a casual entrance to the hotel where Aniston’s party was being held.” the medium reported.

It added that Pitt’s former girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow, and Aniston’s ex-boyfriend John Mayer were also at the party.

It was a night of exes, as Mayer’s ex-girlfriend Katy Perry and her current boyfriend Orlando Bloom were also in attendance.

The medium said there were no reports of Pitt and Aniston mingling throughout the evening, though.

Pitt and Aniston split in 2005 after five years of marriage. Pitt then went on to marry Angelina Jolie, while Aniston wed Justin Theroux.

“Sadly, neither marriage worked out and both Pitt and Aniston are both currently single,” People noted.
