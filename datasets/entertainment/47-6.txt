Budding gospel artiste, Ajike Chimaobi, aka Mobi, has revealed to Sunday Scoop that if not for his strong Christian background, he would have switched to secular music. “To be honest with you, I have been tempted to switch to secular music because it pays more and offers more popularity. However, I am from a Christian home and I am driven by Christian ideals. I am actually doing this to impact lives and bring people closer to Christ. It is not just about the fame or fortune,” he stated.

Recalling the genesis of his career, Mobi said, “I started singing at the age of seven, and my first performance was with my father in the church. Ever since, I have been invited to sing at other churches and events such as graduation ceremonies and weddings. I wrote my first album while I was in secondary school with the help of my dad. Now, I’m a 200 Level student of Babcock University, and my second album is on the way.”

Speaking on what inspired his first album titled, Imela, Mobi said, “I was just playing with the keyboard when my dad came and told me that we should write something. Imela was created just to thank God for everything He has done for me and my family. I get my inspiration from anything including love, life, family and friends.”

On some of the challenges he is currently grappling with, the singer said, “Funding is the major challenge because one has to get proper instruments which can be quite expensive.”
