Since Reekado Banks left Don Jazzy’s Mavin Records, all eyes have been on his ex-label mate, Korede Bello, to take the same decision.

But speaking with Sunday Scoop, Bello said he didn’t need to have a record company like Reekado for him to be his own boss. He stated, “I am a boss of my own and I don’t need to prove that to anyone. I also don’t need to prove that by leaving Mavin Records to set up my own label. With Mavin, we are stronger together.”

The Godwin singer insisted that he was still signed to Mavin Records and had no intention to leave soon. “If you listen to my new song, Mr Vendor, you will know that I’m still with Mavin,” he stated.

Before Mr Vendor, he had released a single, Joko, which he used to empower artistes. Explaining the motive behind his action, he said, “With Joko, we did a social media challenge and gave N2.5m to the winners. We didn’t just give them money, we gave them a platform. You don’t need to sign artistes before you help them. You can just support them with your platform by posting or saying something nice about their songs.”
