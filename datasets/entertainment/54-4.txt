Gospel musician, Bisi Alawiye, has said that her dream was to become an accountant but along the line, music ‘found’ her. She described it as the manifestation of the purpose of God in her life.

The songstress also praised her husband for always being in support of her career, even before they got married.

“I released my first song before I got married; my husband understands my profession very well. We met each other while we were still in the university but at that time; even though I was a chorister, I didn’t think I would go into the music industry because I studied accounting and dreamt of being an accountant after school, but God’s ways are not our ways. I believe in predestination,” she told Saturday Beats.

Asked about the possibility of any of her children following her career path in music, Alawiye noted that was one of her wishes in life.

“I still pray that one of my children will take after me; even if they decide to go into secular music, I’ll simply pray for them for God to lead them and guide them spiritually. There are many secular artistes today that are making waves in their own way,” she added.

Speaking about her upcoming programme , Oluwashindara Mega Concert, centred on prayer, she said it has been a blessing to people who have participated in it in the past.
