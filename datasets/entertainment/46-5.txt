Netflix, the America streaming giant, has acquired award-winning director and producer Kunle Afolayan’s new movie ‘Mokalik.’

Afolayan disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Wednesday on the sideline of the French-Nigerian Cinema Days holding from July 2-3 at the Alliance Francaise, Ikoyi, Lagos.

“I wish to inform you that Netflix has acquired “Mokalik” and some other of my films,” he said.

The acquisition represents Netflix’s ongoing aggressive interest in Africa content.

The company had reportedly signalled that it planned to get serious about ordering/acquiring original series and films from the African continent, created by Africans.

At the Toronto International Film Festival, the streamer acquired Nigerian drama “Lion heart,” the directorial debut of Nollywood veteran actress Genevieve Nnaji.

It was also picked as a Netflix Original movie and was released worldwide on January 4, 2019.

NAN reports that ‘Mokalik’ features singer Simisola Ogunleye, a.k.a Simi, in her debut acting role and Big Brother Naija ex-housemate, Tobi Bakre among other actors.

Mokalik’s plot follows the story of an 11-year-old boy, Jaiye, from the middle-class suburbs, who decides to find his path in life as an apprentice at a mechanic workshop.

When his father arrives to take him home, Jaiye has to make up his mind if he wants to return to school or take on his apprenticeship full time.

“Visiting the mechanic workshop after about 15 years opened my eyes to a lot of things that I believe the world should know about our local auto car repairs industry,” Afolayan had said of the movie.
