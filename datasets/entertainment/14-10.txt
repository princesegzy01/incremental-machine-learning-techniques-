A singer, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, seems prepared to give Nigerians an Independence Day gift of sorts.

The ‘Fall’ singer took to his Instagram page to announce that he would be releasing another song with American singer, Chris Brown, next week.

He also indicated that the song would be produced by Kiddominant.

The new song will be Davido’s second collaboration with Chris Brown within the space of few months.

The first song, ‘Blow my Mind’ already has over 21 million views on YouTube. It was produced by Shizzi and co-written by Wurld.

A few days ago Davido was in Washington DC with Chris Brown on the latter’s IndiGOAT Tour.
