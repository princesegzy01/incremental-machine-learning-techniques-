Budding hip hop group, DYH Crew, has been nominated for the 2019 edition of the prestigious GIAMA Award.

DYH Crewâ€™s hit song, The Code, apparently caught the eyes of the organisers and the group was nominated in the category of Best Upcoming Talent of the Year.

The awards ceremony is scheduled for April 21, 2019, at the glitzy Club Quarters Hotel, Houston, Texas.

GIAMA Award is an annual ceremony that recognises the contributions of Nigerian and African entertainers. The award ceremony, which is in its sixth year, will witness performances by creative Africans from different communities and in Diaspora.
