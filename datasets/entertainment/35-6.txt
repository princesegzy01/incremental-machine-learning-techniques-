Gospel artistes need more creativity –Esther Igbekele
Tofarati Ige

Singer, Esther Igbekele, is doing quite well in her career. However, she has identified (lack of) acceptability as the major challenge besetting her career. She told Saturday Beats, “Acceptability is a major problem because as a gospel artiste, one needs more creativity and modernisation to appeal to many people as possible. To appeal to a wider audience, one needs the English language, so all Yoruba songs must be fully subtitled in English to enjoy more streaming and downloads.”

Also called the ‘Duchess of Music’, Igbekele recounted how the late actor and broadcaster, Alade Aromire, bestowed the title on her. She said, “He (Aromire) took up the marketing of one of my albums titled, Oluwa Loni Glory. Because of my versatility and the video quality of one of the songs, he said I was a very good musician. He said I was more than a queen, and that from then on, he would call me Duchess because he rated me high above every other woman in the industry who called themselves queens.”

Igbekele also said she got the inspiration for her latest song, His Praise, on the road. She added, “I got the song through the help of the Holy Spirit on my way back from a ministration. My band members and I were in on our bus talking when suddenly I heard a voice humming the song into my ears. I quickly asked everyone on the bus to keep quiet and listen to me. I then instructed them to repeat whatever I sang out. And that was how it all started.”
