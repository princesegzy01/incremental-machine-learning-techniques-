Singers, Banky W, Teni, and Rema, are set to thrill graduating secondary school students at a prom concert tagged, Afroprom, in July.

The event is put together to give Nigerian students an opportunity to experience the prom while celebrating, networking, and partying with a host of Nigeria’s top-rated celebrities.

Speaking about Afroprom, lead project manager at J.Vanni Global, Mobola Abiru, said, “We created Afroprom, Nigeria’s first-ever prom concert for high school graduates between the ages of 14 and 18 with the aim of getting these teens to celebrate a remarkable achievement at a crucial stage of their lives. Prom is not new to them; they see it happen everywhere else but not in Nigeria. This spurred us to create an avenue that will welcome them into adult life.”

According to the organisers, media entrepreneur, Debola Williams, and musician and politician, Banky W, will be in attendance to inspire and educate the students on “next steps after school” by sharing authentic stories of their own rise to the top.

Guests will be treated to performances by Teni, Rema, Donflex and the Extigate team, Dream Catchers; while Ushbebe, Ikorodu Bois, and other comedians are expected to thrill the guests as well. Other side attractions include a five-course meal and a shot at the highly coveted Afroprom King and Queen crowns.

The event will be hosted by on-air personality, Jimmy, and guests stand a chance to walk away with enticing gifts, such as an iPhone XR, PlayStation 4, and lots more.
