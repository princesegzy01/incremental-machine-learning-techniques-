On Tuesday, the rapper posted his own videos on Instagram, which he said showed the lead up to the clash.

In those videos, the musician repeatedly asks the young man and his friend to walk the other way.

Swedish prosecutors have until Saturday to decide whether to formally detain the artist. The Prosecution Authority told AFP they didn’t want to comment on the level of evidence since it was “too early in the investigation”.

ASAP Rocky was in the Swedish capital for a concert.

ASAP Rocky was born in New York and had his breakthrough in 2011 with the release of the mixtape “Live. Love. ASAP”. He followed that up in 2013 with the debut album “Long. Live. ASAP”.
