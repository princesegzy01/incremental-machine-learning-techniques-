Posting semi-nude picture was to promote femininity – Maj
Olajide Samuel

Budding songstress, Maj, stirred the hornets’ nest this week when she shared a semi-nude picture of herself. While many felt the semi-nude picture was unnecessary, others criticised her for posing semi-nude.

However, in a chat with Sunday Scoop, the singer shared the inspiration behind the risqué photo-shoot. “I believe that all women are beautiful. I mean we radiate love, forgiveness and humanity. I wanted to celebrate that in its rawest form. It wasn’t so much about sexuality to me. It was about celebrating the natural essence of femininity. And I feel I did it in a tasteful, respectful way. I’m very happy with how it turned out,” she said.

On the reactions generated by the picture, she stated, “The responses were mixed. While some had issues with me posing the way I did, others loved the creativity behind the shoot.”

Speaking further, Maj disagreed with Naira Marley’s claim that having big butts is better than having a Master’s degree. She added, “Absolutely not! Women and girls need to keep moving towards educational excellence! Keep moving higher. Keep pushing for equality. Let no one tell you it’s not worth it. A nice body will surely fade if you are lucky enough to grow old, but knowledge can never be taken away.”

Maj gained prominence after she did a cover of Light Skin, a song to create a balance between different complexions.
