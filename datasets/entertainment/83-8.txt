Over 30 documentary films for screening at iREP Film Festival
In two weeks, the iREP International Documentary Film Festival will kick off in Lagos for the ninth consecutive year. The annual festival, which is aimed at celebrating the best of documentary films in Africa and acclaimed as the biggest film event of its kind on the continent, is scheduled to take place between March 21 and 29.

More than 30 documentary films of international standard have been selected to screen at this year’s festival. Apart from being relevant to the festival’s theme, ‘Africa in self conversation’, these films are expected to project diverse views on Africa and her cultures.

iREP, in partnership with the Independent Television Producers Association of Nigeria, will host a pitch forum for documentary filmmakers during the event.

Equal opportunity will be given to both aspiring and established documentary filmmakers to present their non-fictional film project ideas, with special focus on social/cultural developments in and around Africa before a selection panel. According to the organisers of the festival, the forum is aimed at growing and encouraging a spirited generation of factual filmmakers.

As part of the programme for the festival, no fewer than 70 young and upcoming filmmakers will be trained on the basics of storytelling and film directing. The training is in partnership with the Nigerian Film Corporation.

There will also be keynote speeches on relevant themes and presentations during the festival.

As expected, leaders of thought in filmmaking and film theory will be in conversation with the community of filmmakers present at the festival.
