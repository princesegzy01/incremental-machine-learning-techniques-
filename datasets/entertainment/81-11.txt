Regarded as one of the best rappers to have come out of the country, Mfon Essein, popularly known as Freestyle, left the stage when the ovation was loudest. Formerly with Trybe Records, the rapper was having a brilliant career before he relocated to the United States.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, Freestyle revealed why he left at the time he did. He said, “I decided to leave so that I wouldn’t get stuck on one chapter instead of reading the whole book. Right now, I am focusing on my family. I made a lot of money doing music in Nigeria but I could have invested better.”

Asked what he does for a living now, Freestyle said simply, “Logistics.”

The rapper also stated that he maintained a ‘very cordial’ relationship with other members of Trybe Records. Giving an assessment of the Nigerian music industry at the moment, Freestyle said, “The industry has grown in some regards. However, there are more cliques, and still no love. I like the fact that the young acts now are dream chasing. My only advice to them is to never let it get to their heads, and also watch the company they keep and messages they promote. They should also pay attention to documentation, transparency and accountability as far as the music business is concerned. Content should be original and indigenous; that’s the only way to remain unique.”
