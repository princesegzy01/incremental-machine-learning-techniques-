Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja

Busola Dakolo, a photographer and wife of musician, Timi Dakolo, has accused the founder of Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Pastor Abiodun Fatoyinbo, of rape.

Mrs. Dakolo is the second high profile person after Ese Walter to accuse Fatoyinbo of rape.

The photographer said some years ago, while she was still below the age of 18, the pastor allegedly visited her parents’ home when no one was in the house and allegedly raped her.

She said this during an interview with Y!Naija.

Mrs. Dakolo alleged, “We were living in a duplex at the time. The gate is usually open and people would just knock on the living room door and we would open. My mum had travelled with my sister and it was just my other sister in the house. The house was so big that if you were upstairs, you would not know what is happening downstairs.

“Someone knocked on the door around 6.30am or 7:00 a.m. It was pretty early, I was still in my nightgown. I asked who it was and he said Pastor Biodun. I was wondering what he was doing in our house so early.

She said, “He was already married at that time and his wife had just given birth to a baby”

Efforts to get a reaction from COZA proved abortive on Friday.

Our correspondent put a call through to a phone number listed on its website.

The call was repeatedly rejected and our correspondent was asked to send a text message.

A response had not been sent to The PUNCH as of the time of filing this report.

Another minister at the church, Pastor Precious, hung up the call immediately our correspondent introduced himself and refused to pick subsequent calls.
