My daughter makes me happy even on bad days – GT the Guitarman
Tofarati Ige

Singer, Tokunbo Olugbemiro, aka GT the Guitarman, has said he is proud of the current crop of entertainers in the music industry. In a chat with Sunday Scoop, he said, “The music industry has surpassed my imagination. When I got into the industry in 2005, nobody would have thought that people such as Wizkid and Davido would be able to take the music industry this far. Nobody would have believed that every day, we would be getting closer to winning a Grammy award. I think the new crop of artistes such as Adekunle Gold, Wizkid, Simi, Davido and others are doing amazingly well and I’m proud of them.”

The Osi ma Gbomi singer also complained that some Nigerians seemed not to appreciate good music. He stated, “Nigerians sort of like mediocrity more. There is a level of talent that you have that Nigerians become lukewarm towards. The problem isn’t with the people alone; it also lies in the hands of the creatives. When you are so gifted, you tend not to put in so much hard work into your craft. Highly talented people also need to put in a lot of work to promote their craft.”

Describing the thrills of fatherhood, Olugbemiro said, “After being married, being a father is the next best thing that has happened to me. Fatherhood has made me to depend solely on God. Whenever I am having a bad day and I see my daughter, she makes everything alright.”
