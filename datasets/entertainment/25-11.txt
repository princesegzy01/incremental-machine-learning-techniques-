Popular artiste, Olamide Adedeji, popularly known by his mononym Olamide, has lambasted some of his new male followers for sending him affectionate private messages.

Olamide, in an emotionally charged Instagram post captioned ‘Aboloshi ni boo yin (Maybe a useless person is your boo),’ on Friday, told his followers to be mindful of the fact that he is a man.

The rapper had asked his fans on Wednesday to send him sultry videos of themselves to promote his new single, ‘Pawon’.

In a post showing an illustration of a heavyset woman sitting on a man who lay on the floor, he had said, “All my sexy ladies #Pawon #PawonChallenge. All the baddies, tag me.”

As of Friday afternoon, the artiste had re-posted about 25 videos of his fans, most of whom were dancing suggestively while half-clad.

However, Olamide, in a mix of Pidgin English and Yoruba, cautioned against unwanted advances from fans.

He said, “All the new people that started following me; all these Arabos and some kind of balo people sending me DMs: ‘I love you,’ ‘Hey boo.’

“Are you stupid? Which stupid boo are you looking for?

“It is a man that has the page o. I’m just promoting my page. It’s as if you are crazy. Comport yourselves o.”
