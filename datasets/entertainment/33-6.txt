Organisers of the All Africa Music Awards have unveiled a 13-man jury for this year’s edition of the ceremony. Representing the five regions of Africa, the diaspora (Europe and North America) and the African Union Commission, the jury has been tasked with the responsibility of screening, categorising, assessing, grading, selecting and announcing the nominees into the 36 regional and continental awarding categories who will vie for the 23.9 carat gold-plated AFRIMA trophy.

A statement by the organisers reads in part, “The jury represents the core values of the All Africa Music Awards which is FACE-IT: Fairness, Authenticity, Creativity, Excellence, Integrity and Transparency. They are bringing their span of experience and professionalism to play.”

Meanwhile, 8,157 songs and videos had been submitted on Afrima’s online portal as entry submission closed on Friday, August 2, 2019. This year’s submission continues in the record-setting precedent of previous editions amassing the highest number of entries from African artistes, music producers, songwriters, Disc Jockeys (DJs), and video directors among others, since the inception of the music event.
