Budding artiste and producer, Mobolaji Okotore, simply known as Mobolaji, has said that his music is like a balm that soothes troubled souls.

The singer, who was recently signed to record label and audio-video production company, Mercelo Gustavo, also said he was more interested in touching the hearts of his fans rather than their feet. He told Sunday Scoop, “I am so excited and I don’t know where to start. I have been working with Mercelo Gustavo underground on songs that inspire and encourage the mind because that is what Nigerians need now. I want to touch not just the feet of those who listen to my music but more importantly, their hearts and inspire them to believe they can make it in life no matter the odds. My kind of music is called ‘inspirational highlife’ because I inspire and heal with music.”

The president/CEO of Dijo Group, parent company of Mercelo Gustavo, Innocent Oboh, also expressed confidence in Mobolaji’s ability to ‘put back-on-track’ a music industry that has been accused of lacking content over the years. Oboh said, “I have always known Mobolaji to be a great talent and all he needed was a credible platform to make his dreams come true. There is no better platform than Mercelo Gustavo to take him from the point of talent to exposure.”

Mobolaji’s songs were produced by Mercelo Gustavo’s ace producer, Abiola Bolarinwa, aka, Rhyme Baba.
