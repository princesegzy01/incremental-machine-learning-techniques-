Bois Olorun set for live concert
Members of the indigenous and creative traditional musical group known for their unique brand of gospel apàlà, Bois Olorun, have promised their fans a thrilling experience at their forthcoming live recording concert.

Featuring artistes such as King Sunny Ade, Tope Alabi, Nathaniel Bassey, Frank Edwards, Beejay Sax, Eben, Kenny Blaq, Tim Godfrey, Mike Abdul, Gbenga Adeyinka, Big Bolaji, among others, the show, holding next week in Ikeja, Lagos, is poised to be an eclectic gospel experience.

Speaking with Sunday Scoop, a member of the group, Feranmi, explained the concept of the concert. “We are driven by the motto, ‘Traditional is not Local’. We have used our style and music to revive the love of the younger generation for Nigerian culture and also promoted our culture in the international community. This event is planned to be a unique, creative blend of music, drama, comedy, dance, and games, targeted at redeeming entertainment as a tool for building a great society, packaged into a live recording,” he said.

The first edition of the concert held in 2018 at the Jogor Centre, Ibadan, and attracted over 2,500 people.
