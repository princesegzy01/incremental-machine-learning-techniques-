These days, it is not strange to see actors play roles of lesbians and homosexuals in movies. While many movie buffs have condemned movies like that, other enthusiasts believe nothing is wrong in depicting such roles.

Rising filmmaker and actress, Seun Omojola, in a chat with Sunday Scoop stated that she cannot play such roles in a movie.

She said, “I can’t act a same-sex lover character. I can act another role in the movie if it has a good storyline but I cannot interpret the role of a lesbian.”

Speaking further, the busty actress stated that she once spent her entire savings on producing a movie. She added, “I can recall spending my savings on a movie. When the movie was eventually released, I didn’t recoup the capital, let alone profit. It was a great learning experience for me.”

Omojola also stated that though plus size women are making giant strides in the entertainment industry, they are not given much attention.

“Plus size women are doing great things in movie industries all over the world but you can count them because they are not much. And that’s because the entertainment industry has painted a picture of who the ideal leading lady should be, which is mostly size six-12.”
