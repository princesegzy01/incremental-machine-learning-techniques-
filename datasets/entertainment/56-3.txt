Tofarati Ige

Nigerian-born Italian reggae star, Kingsley Osagie, aka, Winning Jah, has announced the release of his new single, Asking, to celebrate Bob Marley.

The new song, which was released by Universal Music Group for Spinnup Records, was produced by Abjos.

In the educative and electrifying reggae dancehall fusion, Winning Jah spoke about injustice and prejudice towards anyone with dreadlocks. He also advised adults not to give youths marijuana or cigarettes.

Speaking about the song, Winning Jah said, “Music is not just all about the sound or the lyrics you hear; you must be creative too. I really like my album art cover. It is different from what every other reggae artiste does. It was designed by Italian gallery, Emi Peccorini, to express my feelings.”
