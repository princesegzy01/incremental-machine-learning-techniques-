Abimbola Rain set for Osuba worship concert
Singer, Abimbola Rain, has said plans are in top gear for his worship concert tagged, Osuba. The concert, which will feature the artiste’s colleagues including Babs Carpenterz, The Minstrels, Eniolarh, Abiodun Sage, Seun Boyejo, among others, is set to hold next Sunday, June 30, in Ogba, Lagos.

Speaking on the inspiration behind the concert, Rain said, “The concert was inspired by the grace of God upon my life and what I have been through lately. In other words, I just think I’m closer to where He is taking me to. His goodness and mercy have always been sufficient for me.”

The singer stated that though there was no sponsor for the show yet, the plans had been going smoothly. “Though we don’t have any sponsor for the concert, God has been faithful and everything has been going on according to plan. What’s more important is that I pray, fast and work my way to the top because only a few people want to help. Presently, I am not even signed to any record label,” he added.

On gospel singers not practising what they preach, Rain said, “That is true but not everybody is guilty of that. Remember the Bible says that ‘many are called but few are chosen’, so it’s not surprising.”
