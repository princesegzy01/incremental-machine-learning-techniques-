Tobi Aworinde, Abuja

The Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers in Lagos State, Musiliu Akinsanya, aka MC Oluomo, has rallied behind one of the Big Brother Naija 2019 finalists, Mike Edward, as the show draws to a close.

Akinsanya, in a video shared widely online by Edward’s team, expressed his support for the BBNaija housemate with the contestant’s wife, Perri Shakes-Drayton, standing all smiles beside him.

The NURTW boss, holding a T-shirt on which Edward’s face was emblazoned, said, “Please, vote for Mike. My people everywhere, I beg you in the name of God. You know the reason I like Mike is that he sang about me.

“He even sang, ‘MC I go go Oshodi for your case. I go tell MC Oluomo. I go report all of them.’ My people, please, for God’s sake, help me vote for Mike o. He’s my friend o.

“Please, for God’s sake, I know Mike from the UK and this is his wife from the UK. She has come to meet me in Nigeria. Please, vote for Mike. Thank you, God bless you all.”
