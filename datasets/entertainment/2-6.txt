I used to have a crush on Don Jazzy – Ferrari Okoro

Bank worker-turned-actress, Ferrari Okoro, certainly has what it takes to get male attention. The voluptuous role-interpreter, born to a Nigerian father from Delta State and a Cameroonian mother, maintains that she has never been attracted to any of her male colleagues in the course of doing her job.

Speaking with Saturday Beats, the actress said, “No, I haven’t been attracted to anyone. I don’t believe in dating where I work. It doesn’t work for me that way. I have a crush on Will Smith but he is a Hollywood actor. Don Jazzy used to be my crush too, but he has a crush on Rihanna.”

On the weirdest message she has ever got from a fan, Ferrari said she had got many of them. She stated, “When it comes to weird messages, I get a lot of them. Nothing surprises me anymore. Nothing (seems to be) weird these days; we are in perilous times. Fans send their nude pictures and do all sorts. I don’t get surprised anymore.”

The curvy actress also advised ladies never to send their nude pictures to anyone they’re not married to. She added, “I have never sent my nude picture to any man. I think any lady who sends her nude picture to a man she is not married to is not wise.”

Though Ferrari gets her male fans drooling whenever she posts pictures on her Instagram page, the ‘Omotoke Gold’ actress said she didn’t want attention to be on her looks. She said, “I am grateful God showcased his artistry on my body but I am much more than that. The focus should be on my talent, not body.”
