Artistes signed to the stable of Slize Entertainment Records have released their first official song together. Titled, Slize Dem All, it features Crystawonda, Slizeboy Ability and Razily.

The CEO of the record label, Ehimwenma Maxwell, who also added his voice to the track, said it was a tune that everybody would fall in love with. Maxwell also stated that his sojourn in the entertainment industry was motivated by his love for his immediate environment.

He said, “Growing up was quite tough. The hustle started early for me. I grew up in the popular Benin City in an area where artistic activities take place daily. In due course, I identified my niche in the industry. My entrepreneurial inclination was nurtured by the urge to touch my immediate environment and society at large. From the outset, I was determined to take entertainment to another level and create jobs for people.

“It was the same thing that attracted me to making movies. My love and passion for the entertainment industry cannot be overemphasised. Talent is a natural gift or ability given to humans by God, but which must be nurtured. I have always had high regard for creative minds and products, so when the dream began to materialise, I decided to go fully into music. As we speak, Slizeboy Ability, Crystawonda and Razily are the lucky acts that I am grooming, but more will surely follow. Their new song, Slize Dem All, was produced by Kulboy, and mixed and mastered by Kaymix.”
