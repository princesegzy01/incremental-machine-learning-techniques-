A new nightclub, Silverflox, has been opened at Oniru, Victoria Island, Lagos.

Speaking at the opening ceremony of the entertainment hub, the Chief Executive Officer, Big Slim, said Silverfox was more than a club. He stated, “It’s an entertainment Mecca because we have other exciting attractions for Nigerians. Fun lovers can actually walk in at any time of the day to relax and have fun.”

The entertainment mogul said his desire to provide a place where people could celebrate in a luxurious way gave birth to the hub. He added, “With a great brand image and reputation in the nightlife industry, the hub is here to stay. Our prime location is also an advantage we will not take it for granted.

“I plan to transform the nightlife in Nigeria with the same quality of services obtainable overseas. I live in Florida, United States of America, and I have seen how things are done in their entertainment and nightlife industry.”
