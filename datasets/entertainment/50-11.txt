“Bryan ‘Birdman’ Williams has supported me since my first years directing, and this joint venture is a natural business and creative transition – the first of many.”

‘Tazmanian Devil’ follows Dayo, a 19-year-old immigrant (Attah) who, after moving to the US, struggles to bond with his estranged father, who abandoned his family to become a missionary.

When he joins a college fraternity, he is challenged by his father, leaving him in search of his own moral ground.

Attah will be joined by Adepero Oduye (Pariah, When They See Us), who plays his mother and Nater Guma Mbaho Mwime (Queen of Katwe, The Chi), who plays his deeply religious father.

NAN reports that no official release date has been revealed, but the film is currently post-production.
