I want to be first Nigerian to win Grammy award –Amakarh
Singer, songwriter and composer, Chiamaka Okechukwu, aka Amakarh, has said that though Nigerian music is now widely accepted in different parts of the world, new grounds can still be broken.

In an interview with Saturday Beats, Amakarh said, “I’m very happy about the progress that has been recorded in the Nigerian entertainment industry over the years. Nigerian artistes are now the darlings of the world but I believe we can still do much better. I have my eyes set on wining the biggest awards there are on the planet, such as the Grammy. That would make me really glad and I would not relax until I have achieved my dream.”

Reminded that many artistes had made similar pronouncements in the past, Okechukwu insisted that she would be different.

“I started making music at a very young age, so it is not something I stumbled on. With dedication and commitment to excellence, I believe I can be the first Nigerian artiste to win a Grammy award. Though, officially, I started making music this year, I have written and composed songs for other artistes in the past.

I believe I have the necessary experience to make headway. I’m not in competition with anybody but my style is unique and that is my selling point.”

Speaking on her debut single, ‘Maybe’, released under the imprint of 2304 Entertainment, the singer said, “It is a groovy tune that I believe many will enjoy and be able to relate with. I want my fans to regard this as the first of many to come.”
