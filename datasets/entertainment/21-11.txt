I don’t support nudity – Immaculate Edache
Olajide Samuel

Singer, Immaculate Edache, popularly known as Immaculate, has said that though she supports curvy women to be comfortable in their own skin, she doesn’t endorse nudity. She told Sunday Scoop, “I don’t know about projecting sex appeal on social media. I personally just live life and try to be my best self by encouraging voluptuous women to be confident in their own skin. I don’t support nudity.”

The former Project Fame finalist also stated that the Nigerian music industry is not conducive for reality show stars. She said, “I don’t think the Nigerian music industry is conducive for reality show stars. A lot of talents are usually discovered and put in the spotlight during such shows. However, they are often left hanging, putting them in a fix after the show because they cannot get the necessary help needed to push their careers to the top. They are left to keep up with the ‘star life’ and are expected to live in a certain way that their finances cannot sustain. Fortunate ones get good deals after the shows or are lucky to make a name for themselves. It’s indeed sad to see great talents wither away.”

On why she had been off the music scene for some time, Immaculate said, “I have many outstanding projects that have taken so much time to be unveiled to the public. I am super excited about all and the gradual process of execution. Like it’s usually said, ‘It’s not how far, but how well’. The end result is all that matters.”
