I almost gave up music – Chioma Jesus
Olushola Ricketts

Popularly known as Chioma Jesus, Evangelist Amaka Okwuoha says becoming a successful gospel musician has not come easy for her.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, Chioma Jesus said as a young lady, she didn’t have anyone to support her music. She stated, “I have been singing for 20 years now and I have faced many challenges. When you are new, people wouldn’t believe in you or support your dream. But today, all that is gone. I overcame the challenge by putting my trust in God, not men. Also, I knew what God wanted from me and who I was.”

She, however, admitted that despite being strong-willed, there were times her faith was tested. The singer said, “There were times I almost gave up; I think that is normal with every human being. But once you remember who you are, you don’t need to doubt yourself or the power of God.”

On how she came about her stage name, Chioma said, “It is a divine name from God. When I was about to release my first album, I prayed for many months and God gave me the name. Chioma means God and Jesus is his son.”

She also said being a singer had not stopped her from playing her role as a wife and mother. She stated, “The Bible says a good woman builds her home. If you are a minister, you shouldn’t allow it to affect your home and vice versa. God has been helpful in managing my home and the ministry.”
