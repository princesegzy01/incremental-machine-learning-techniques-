Iyanya lied that I cheated him – Ubi Franklin
The Chief Executive Officer of Made Men Music, Ubi Franklin, has denied singer Iyanya’s claims that he was cheated out of his co-ownership of the record label.

Franklin, in an Instagram post, accused Iyanya of deliberately lying about the issue to “make himself look good”.

Supporting his claims with photoshots of conversations between him and Iyanya and documents dating back to 2016, he wrote, “It’s very unfortunate that a person I took as my brother had to lie to the world to make himself look good. Always wait for both sides of the story to call people names.

“Here is to prove that Iyanya lied to make himself look good. I have never fought anyone I have worked with, dated or married publicly. And I swore never to do that.

“We try to settle things in house and if that can’t happen we call on elders to mediate, it has always worked”.

Iyanya had, in an interview with Ndani TV, claimed that he did not sell his share of MMM, but decided to leave label because there was so much ‘darkness’ there.

He had said, “What people don’t know is that I didn’t sell my share. People see me and ask why I sold my share of the company. I didn’t sell my shares, but I left Made Men at the time because there was so much darkness. In the midst of all the wings, I decided to let that go.

“When I said it was darkness, I mean that I was not myself anymore because I felt like there was no trust anymore.

“Because at the time I was singing, I co-owned Made Men with Ubi. But I later realised that my name was not in any of the forms I signed and I was broken. That was the beginning of me just saying to hell with everything.”
