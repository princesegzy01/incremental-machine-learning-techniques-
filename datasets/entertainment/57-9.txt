During the week, a video surfaced online in which Starboy Entertainment artiste, Wizkid, could be seen lightly spanking Tiwa Savage’s butt. Expectedly, the rumour mill went agog with several fans insisting that the relationship between both artistes was beyond platonic.

Days after, at Patoranking’s album listening party, Tiwa and Wizkid showed that they indeed have a bond.

Tiwa had arrived at the event way earlier than Wizkid but once she got word that Starboy had arrived the venue, she and her entourage quickly went out of the premises to welcome him. She patiently walked by Wizkid’s side as he greeted those who struggled to get his attention. Even when he got into the hall, Tiwa sat dutifully by his side. Intermittently, she could be seen whispering into his ears as both of them giggled like school kids.

Also, contrary to news making the rounds online that Wizkid did not accord 2baba respect when greeting him at the event, Sunday Scoop can authoritatively report that this wasn’t so. Wizkid actually greeted 2baba properly. As a matter of fact, 2baba and his wife, Annie, were on their way out of the venue when Wizkid came in. Both men exchanged a handshake and had a brief chat. Wizkid also acknowledged Annie before going into the venue.
