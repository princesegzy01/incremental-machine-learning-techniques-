There was anxiety among fans of popular singer, Majekodunmi Fasheke, aka Majek Fashek, when it was reported on some online media that the artiste fondly known as the ‘Rainmaker’ had passed on in London.

However, his manager and friend, Umenka Uzoma, told SATURDAY BEATS that the veteran singer was getting better.

In a WhatsApp chat enquiring about Majek’s health status, Uzoma wrote, “He is improving (sic) better.”

Billionaire and business mogul, Femi Otedola, had offered to settle Majek’s medical bills. Uzoma, however, didn’t answer other questions about the nature of the singer’s ailment.

Majek Fashek is best known for his 1988 chart-topping song, ‘Send Down the Rain.’ At the peak of his career, the singer was one of the most popular African entertainers, before he faded out of the scene.

Though many believe his career crashed due to drug addiction, Majek Fashek maintained it was a spiritual problem.
