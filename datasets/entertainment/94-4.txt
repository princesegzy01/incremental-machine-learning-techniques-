Sexagenarian unveils first book in Ibadan
David Olorunsogo, Ibadan

A sexagenarian, Kike Ojo, on Tuesday, unveiled her first novel, The Fragrance of Roses, at the Jogor Centre in Ibadan, capital of Oyo State.

The public presentation of the novel, published in 2018, was witnessed by the new author’s childhood friend and former Deputy Governor of Ekito State, Prof Dupe Adelabu and a retired professor of Comparative Literature at the Lincoln University, Pennsylvania, USA, Ropo Sekoni.

In her address, the author said that she had always dreamed of writing a novel that would be accessible to everybody in the society.

She said, “I’ve always had a flair for literature right from my higher secondary school. I had often felt intrigued by the way people put words together and we had to deconstruct before we understood.

“One day, I said to myself that I would write something that everyone would be able to understand. I waited till 68 years before writing my first book because I had been busy with my family. After which I deemed it fit to give back to the society through writing.”

Mrs. Ojo said the ‘The Fragrance of Roses’ would be of great use to octogenarians.
