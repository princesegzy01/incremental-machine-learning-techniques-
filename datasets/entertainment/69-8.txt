Budding gospel singer, Elijah Daniel, aka Omo Majemu, has told Sunday Scoop that though he has faced a lot of challenges in his career, the grace of God has kept him. He stated, “I have actually been through a lot in the course of my career but a lot of people may not know it. Some people may see me as an overnight success, but we thank God that we don’t look like what we have been through. However, in all I have been through, God’s grace has always been sufficient for me. I am a product of His grace and I will always be grateful for his loving kindness towards me.”

Speaking on some of the challenges he has to grapple with, Daniel said, “Success doesn’t come easy but through hard work. Some of the challenges we face mostly are in terms of appreciation. Some churches take musicians for granted at times though we honour them by accepting their invitations. After our ministration, they would just say ‘God bless you’ with handshake without giving us any form of honorarium. Meanwhile, as a musician, one would have gone there with about 10 people as a band, and one would need to give each of them transport fare, at least.”

On the changes he would like to see in the industry, the praise and worship leader said, “The changes I will love to see is for churches and everyone in general that have been blessed by gospel music to start appreciating, encouraging and supporting gospel music ministers in any good way they can. We should let love lead and remember that we rise by lifting one another. May God help us.”
