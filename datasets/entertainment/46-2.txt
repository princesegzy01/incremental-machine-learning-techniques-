Don advocates investment in art and craft sector
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Executive Director of the Centre for Black Culture and International Understanding, Osogbo, Osun State, Prof ‘Siyan Oyeweso, has urged Nigerians to invest in the arts and craft sector because the sector has the potential to secure future for all who invest in it.

Oyeweso, who said that part of the mandate of the centre was to promote the arts and work toward the preservation of the African cultural heritage, maintained that the CBCIU would continue to insist on the benefits inherent in investing in art works.

Making specific reference to an instance where the buying and selling of art works had proved to be good business, Oyeweso said that a painting titled ‘Monalisa’ by the globally acclaimed artist, Leonardo Da Vinci, which is currently valued $350m, was first painted and sold $50.00.

Corroborating Oyeweso, the Founder of the Genesis Art Gallery, Osogbo, Mr. Yinka Fabayo, said investing in art and craft through the purchase of art works provides opportunity for storage of resources.

The two speakers were guests at an art exhibition held to mark this year’s Fathers’ Day organised by the Genesis Art Gallery, Osogbo and attended by renowned educationist, Prof. Olu Aina, Justice Olamide Oloyede (rtd) and Orangun of Oke Ila, Oba Adedokun Abolarin, amongst other dignitaries.
