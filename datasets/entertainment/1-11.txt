I try to stay away from trouble – Small Doctor
Mobola Sadiq

Almost a year after popular singer, Adekunle Temitope, aka Small Doctor, got arrested for alleged unlawful possession of a firearm, the singer has said he’s trying to stay off trouble for now.

The Omo Better crooner who was arrested along with three others was reportedly let go with a warning not to be involved in any violent act for the next one year.

When Sunday Scoop caught up with Small Doctor, he admitted that things had been good for him this year, adding that there was always a need to do more. He said, “I will keep pushing harder as one cannot be too comfortable in the music industry.

“Also, I thank God for my growth. I try to stay away from trouble now even though negativity will always come.”

The ‘street ambassador’ who is ever proud of his roots in Agege insisted that he had no intention to stop using the Agege Stadium, Lagos, for his concerts.

“Agege is where my story started from– it is my hood. The stadium is the only place that can contain the massive crowd we ‘hold down’ and it is also the only way I can give back to my people for the love and support (they have shown me) over the years. I feel there are lots of good things out of Agege that people need to experience. For instance, there are many young talented and hardworking boys from there. Agege should not be known for bad things alone.”

The former protégé of Pasuma Wonder stated that he had invited a lot of his colleagues for his December concert. They include Reminisce, Mr Eazi, Zlatan Ibile, Reekado Banks, Harrysong, Duncan Mighty, Slimcase, Q Dot, Oritse Femi, Idowest, Mz Kiss, Vector, among others.
