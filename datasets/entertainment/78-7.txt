I am not trying to be like Lagbaja –Adlib The JourneyMan

Up-and-coming musician, Adlib The JourneyMan, made his first appearance on Instagram with a masked face. His entrance immediately reminded Nigerians about Lagabaja, the legendary musician known for his masked face. He was showered with insults and accused of being a copycat. In a chat with Saturday Beats, the Kwara State-born artiste noted that the reason he decided to hide his identity with a mask was because he enjoyed the anonymity.

“I expected the backlash I got because of my mask. In the UK, there are many artistes who wear masks to cover their faces. In Nigeria, the only person people know who covers his face is Lagbaja. There is no doubt that the comparison is going to happen. I am not worried because I am not going to stop covering my face, they will get used to it, I am not trying to be like Lagbaja, I don’t sing like him.

“I am very proud of the Yoruba culture and my African origin; I wanted the mask to remind people of African masqueraders. I just wanted to showcase that culture. The advantage of hiding my identity is greater than any obstacle I’ll face. It empowers me and allows me to make the kind of music that I want,” he told Saturday Beats.
