“Timing of the 2022 Olympics, the Super Bowl and national holidays will keep the 2021 and 2022 dates on the last Sunday in February,” the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and US network ABC said.

“The Academy and ABC continue to evaluate dates for future years.”

The annual Academy Awards ceremony, which recognizes the best in cinema, is broadcast live from Hollywood on ABC and in more than 225 countries and territories worldwide.
