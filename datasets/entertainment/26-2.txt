‘You Need to Calm Down’ earned the country-turned-pop singer one of the top prizes – video of the year. It also won the ‘video for good’ award.

Accepting the video of the year award, Swift said that since the VMAs are chosen by fans, “it means that you want a world where we are all treated equally under the law.”

Swift and pop singer Ariana Grande went into the fan-voted ceremony in New Jersey, with leading 10 nominations each and also were competing for song of the year, best pop, and video of the year.

Grande, currently on tour in Europe and absent from Monday’s show, was also a contender for the top award – artist of the year – along with Cardi B.

Other contenders were 17-year-old alternative pop newcomer Billie Eilish, Halsey, the Jonas Brothers and Shawn Mendes.

Cardi B beat out a male-dominated lineup to win best hip-hop video for ‘Money’ and ended a delighted acceptance speech saying, “Thank you, Jesus.”

The outspoken rapper also presented Missy Elliott with the 2019 Vanguard Award for career achievement, calling her “a champion for women who want to be doing their own thing.”

Cardi B presented Elliott her award and prefaced it with a heartfelt speech about the wide-spread impact the rapper had on the music industry and on Cardi B herself.

She said, “Everybody has copied from Missy Elliott! Even me! I don’t care, so what!”

Best new artist contender Lizzo performed her hits ‘Truth Hurts’ and ‘Good as Hell’ in a yellow sequined bodysuit, accompanied by plus-size dancers, in a message for body positivity.

Male winners included Korean boy band BTS, who won for best K-Pop and the recently reunited Jonas Brothers, who paid tribute to their New Jersey roots with a performance from Asbury Park.
