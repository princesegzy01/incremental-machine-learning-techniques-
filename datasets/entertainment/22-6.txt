Popular American artiste, Nicki Minaj, has said she is retiring from music to have a family.

The rapper stated that much in a tweet on Thursday, September 5, 2019.

“I’ve decided to retire and have my family. I know you guys are happy now. To my fans, keep ‘reppin’ me, do it ‘till da death of me, in the box – cuz ain’t nobody checkin me,’” she wrote.

However, the announcement was met with bewilderment from Minaj’s fans, some of whom couldn’t quite believe that the rapper was actually retiring and suggested her tweet might have been a joke.
