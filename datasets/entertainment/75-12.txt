Budding singer, model and photographer, Naomi Branch, obviously knows what she wants and she is not afraid to go after it with tenacity and focus. However, it hasn’t been a bed of roses as the prolific entertainer once escaped being raped in the course of advancing her career.

Sharing the experience with Sunday Scoop, Branch said, “The major challenges I face in my career are funding and sexual harassment from men, especially those who you approach for help. It’s very difficult, especially for young, beautiful up-and-coming acts like me. A case in point was when a radio presenter and comedian tried to rape me because I was looking for a job. I was able to escape from his grip and reported him to the police. He was arrested but later released because his family is rich and influential. There are many cases like that and the only way to make it is if you can get a genuine sponsor.”

Describing her style of music as pop and afro highlife, Branch lists Yemi Alade as one of her role models. The singer also stated that she was presently working on the video for her new song, Ayo, which is enjoying favourable airplay at the moment. “The song is about me thanking God for all He has done for me in just a short time of deciding to embrace a professional music career. God has been so gracious and I just want to use the music to thank Him for His divine help,” she added.
