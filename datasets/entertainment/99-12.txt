For a long time, it was believed that there was a cartel in the industry that dictated who got what roles and who made it to the silver screens. A lot of up and coming actors often complained then that no matter how hard they worked, their efforts were never enough except they had a godfather or godmother to clear the way for them.

However, a veteran in the industry, Ann Njemanze, has some good news. She told Sunday Scoop that the cartel in Nollywood had been dismantled. Listing some of the highlights of the industry over the years, she said, “I know that Nollywood has employed a lot of people; that is the major one. Also, the cartel in the industry has been broken and that is beautiful. Now, it is easier for actors to rise to the top of their careers through hard work and creativity. I am happy that the current actors are able to do the things they are doing with the resources that they have because indeed, there are a lot of challenges. You should not compare us to Hollywood because they have more resources than us and they have been in existence for a longer time.”

Rubbishing the notion that the industry mostly makes substandard films, Ann said, “Every industry has its bad eggs and every industry has its growing period, during which it develops its style and techniques. Given the circumstances we are working in, I think we are doing great.”
