Saxtee to promote Nigerian culture abroad
Ace saxophonist, Babatunde Balogun, also known as Saxtee, is set to embark on an extensive tour of the United States.

According to a statement issued by the Chief Executive Officer, Sammek Entertainment, Mr. Samuel Ekundayo, the organisers of the tour, the tour is aimed at promoting the rich cultural heritage of Nigeria, as well as aspects of her values that are unknown to the American public and the world at large.

Saxtee, the statement noted, will be touring the US with the full compliments of his band and the production crew. They are expected to perform at events and carnivals, including the Asa Festival in Houston, Texas; Talent Nite, Philadelphia; The Egbe Omo Obokun of Ijeshaland Day at Townson, Maryland; Egbe Omo Ondo Carnival, in Florida; Miliki Nite, Maryland; and Lisabi Day in Indiana.

The statement said, “Saxtee, being a vibrant and versatile cultural musician-cum-ambassador quite easily fits into the aims and objectives of all of the events he will perform at, which are to promote the values and morals of the various Nigerian cultures and re-invent the thinking of the entire world about the intrinsic potential inherent in Nigerian showbiz and entertainment practitioners.”
