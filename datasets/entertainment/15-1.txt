CNN African Voices recaps September editions
Kore Ogidan and Dayo Adeola

This weekend’s episode of Globacom-sponsored ‘African Voices’ on CNN International will be a recap of the previous editions held in September. Viewers will thus have the opportunity of seeing how the inspirational stories of three of the guests who featured on the programme during the month interrelate to underscore the change agenda on the African continent.

The guests who have become change makers through music and ecotourism are Zambia’s Mwila Musonda, popularly known as Slapdee, Mogamat Shamier Magmoet of South Africa, and Albert Ndereki of Botswana.

Magmoet took to diving four years ago and through it came to realise the threat posed to aquatic life by humans. “I found out that billions of tons of waste and garbage end up in the oceans every year, and kill the marine and plant life,” he told African Voices.

The second guest, Ndereki, is one of the longest-serving members of the Botswana tourism industry and was one of the builders of the country’s game lodge in 1971. He has successfully mentored young ones from the country’s local communities to be responsible and diligent while nurturing the environment through ecotourism.

On the other hand, Musonda (Slapdee) lost his parents and only sibling while still young. He began his career in hip hop and rap as a high school student.

Slapdee has received nominations and awards, including the 2009 Ngoma Music Award for best hip-hop artist and the AFRIMMA Award nomination(s) for Best Male (artiste) Southern Africa. He has also clinched nine Zambian Music awards for best male and hip-hop artiste and six Sun FM Kwacha Music Awards.
