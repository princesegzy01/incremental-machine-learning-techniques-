I Go Dye congratulates Okowa
Popular stand-up comedian, Francis Agoda, aka I Go Dye, may not be a politician but over time he has spoken about political issues.

Following the re-election of the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, for a second term in office, the comedian has appealed to politicians in the state to work with the leader to move the state forward.

He said, “Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, I congratulate you because it’s an overwhelming victory and your personality as a humble man won you the re-election.

“At this point, I kindly call on all Deltans, most especially the political class, to embrace one another. This should be a moment to build our state and bring about even development in all sectors, irrespective of party affiliations. We should nurture a common goal of unity and develop the state. I appeal to Great Ogboru, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, and all politicians in Delta State to work with Okowa to develop the state.”

While congratulating Omo-Agege, the comedian advised him to do all he can to create more job opportunities for youths and work to develop the state should he emerge as the new Senate President.

“The level of development which is desired in Delta State honestly requires the collective responsibility and support of everyone. We cannot achieve the goal of development without the cooperation of oneness and being above partisan affiliations. Let’s forge a new path of sacrifice and lasting peace, with just one goal as brothers and sisters. Once more, congratulations to you all,” he said.
