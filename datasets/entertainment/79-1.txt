ICYMI: Tonto Dikeh, Don Jazzy, others respond to Richard’s claim that N120m debt forced him to close Escape Lagos
Some celebrities, including Tonto Dikeh, Don Jazzy, Sound Sultan, Patoranking and others have been responding to the claim made by night club owner, Richard Nnadi, that he was forced to close down his business, the Escape Lagos, due to debts which were over N120 million.

Nnadi on his Instagram page, @dukesofspades, shared a video, in which, he threatened to publish the names of the debtors, among whom he said were politicians, footballers, musicians, Big Brother housemates, politicians and even slay queens.

He captioned the video, “Good morning everyone!

Guess What Season It Is?

Yes! You got it right …

It’s Fvck You Season…

@tontolet I am sorry but it’s time we switched up on these debtors!

Other club owners won’t say anything cos they are still in the business but I’m out and never going back so I will take this for the rest of us that can’t speak!

Footballers, musicians, Big Brother housemates, politicians and even slay queens.

I’m coming for all of you, cos April 1st is a day for fools!”

His tirade was also shared on the night club’s Instagram page, where he shared that the debtors’ list would be published on April 1.

The club’s post was captioned, “Everyone always said, ‘Save the relationship, don’t expose your customers’. So we kept quiet till finally, we couldn’t sustain the club anymore so we had to close the business! These people that owed us didn’t want us to survive. These people didn’t want us to be able to pay staff salaries. These people put over 80 families without a source of income because, we had to shut down!

@tiwasavage has said it all now it’s time to break this table and let everyone know who these wicked people are!”

Since this threat was issued, celebrities have been commenting on the posts. While Tonto Dikeh, begged Nnadi to sue his debtors, instead of publicly publishing their names, others made fun of the debtors.
