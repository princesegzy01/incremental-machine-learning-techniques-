I’m here to shake the industry – Poposkii
Mobola Sadiq

Singer, composer and songwriter, Ayokunle Akinmola, aka Poposkii, may be new in the music industry but he has tall dreams. He told Sunday Scoop that he was ready to ‘shake things up’. He said, “I have always loved music and I am very passionate about it. I believe that I have something unique to offer and I’m here to shake the industry, so other artistes have to be on their toes. I have been writing songs for people for a long time, but I just recently released my first single titled, Shupe. It is a club banger that is guaranteed to get people to dance away their sorrows.”

Signed to 2304 Entertainment, Poposkii maintained that his aim was to help people have fun. “We all know that things aren’t so rosy in the country at the moment. But instead of sitting down in a corner to mope about something one cannot change, I believe it’s better to cast one’s worries aside and dance to one’s heart delight. I am optimistic that things would get better in the country, and I share some of those positive ‘vibes’ in my music,” he added.
