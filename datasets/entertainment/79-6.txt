Why Eledumare Festival is important to us – Gani Adams
Eric Dumo

Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, has said that one of the most important and interesting aspects of the annual Eledumare Festival is that it draws people closer to God.

The cultural event aimed at showcasing the unique aspects of the Yoruba way of life, took a colourful dimension this year following the introduction of new innovations that added spark to the festival.

Describing the annual event as beneficial to mankind in general while announcing the appointment of new sets of aides through a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Aderemi, Adams said that he would continue to use his capacity as the Aare Ona Kakanfo to promote Yoruba unity in Nigeria and beyond.

He said, “For the past six years, we have been devoting our time and resources to celebrate Eledumare Festival and other events promoting our cultural identity and we shall continue to do so.

“The interesting aspect for me is that it draws people closer to God. It reminds us of how great He is in our lives.”

Speaking further, Adams said that the appointments of Mr. Kunle Lawal and Samson Oseni as special assistants, Information Technology, and Special Duties respectively, will assist his office in contributing more significantly to societal development.

He said, “I wish to bring to the notice of the public, the Oodua People’s Congress, and the Oodua Progressive Union in the Diaspora that Mr. Segun Akanni, having relocated abroad, is no longer working with the office of the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland.”
