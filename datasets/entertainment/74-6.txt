A new pageant, Miss Telecom Nigeria, has got a lot of young and beautiful girls excited. Organised by DFO Media Concept, in conjunction with DAK Marketing Services Limited, and supported by the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria and Association of Telecoms Companies of Nigeria, the pageant is to ‘celebrate the Nigerian telecommunications industry for its growth over the years’.

The pageant is scheduled to hold on July 27, 2019 and is open to Nigerian ladies between the age of 18 and 30.

Speaking on the reason for the pageant, the chief organiser, Festus Ogana, said, “The pageant is about celebrating the rich Nigerian culture in a very unique way. Nigeria is a colourful combination of cultures and landscapes; a place that fully embraces its heritage and celebrates its diversity. You also cannot take away the fact that the Nigerian telecoms industry has helped in many diverse ways to boost the Nigerian cultural heritage.

“Everyone, irrespective of age or social status, go about with mobile phones and connect to global debates. Telecommunications has positively changed our way of thinking, relating and transacting businesses. This has been made more pronounced with the global acceptance of social media. Therefore, Miss Telecoms Nigeria will be presented as a pageant that celebrates our rich cultural beliefs and heritage and the Nigerian telecoms industry at the same time.”

The winner of the pageant will be the face of the Nigerian telecoms industry for the duration of her reign.
