Anambra State-born Nigerian DJ, Dozie Udemadu, aka DJ Dozzy Ross, believes that collaborations between Nigerian artistes and their American counterparts have not translated to commercial success because record labels in the United States are still hesitant to invest a lot of money in the projects. He said, “In the US, artistes make money from online streaming and album sales. But in Nigeria, they only make money from shows and endorsements. Such arrangements don’t favour the record labels here in America because they invest so much in promotions and videos. They expect to see returns but they really don’t because the Nigerian market isn’t as profitable as what obtains in America yet. However, Nigerian music is getting popular in the US and that is a good thing because money is bound to follow.”

The disc jockey also told Sunday Scoop that DJs like him were responsible for introducing Nigerian music to the American audience. He stated, “As a Nigerian, I was among the first group of DJs who kept playing Afrobeats songs to different crowds, including blacks, whites and Latinos, until they became open to our music. Now, you can’t go to any club or event in America without the DJs playing Afrobeats songs. Now, we are accepted as the new trend over here.”

Trained in Atlanta by DJ D Cas of Connections DJs, Dozzy Ross, has recorded songs with artistes such as Tekno, Cap 1, Skales, Runtown and Ball Greezy. He also revealed that he would soon release an EP of six songs complete with videos.
