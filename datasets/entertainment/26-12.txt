I’m a businessman, not musician – JJC
Olajide Samuel

Singer, producer and director, AbdulRasheed Bello, aka JJC Skillz, has been instrumental to the success of artistes such as Don Jazzy and D’banj. The entertainment entrepreneur who runs Scene One Production Records with his wife, Funke Akindele-Bello, has, however, not been releasing songs for a while now.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, JJC noted that whenever he was not (active) on the music scene, he was busy grooming talents.

“I have always been a record label owner from the beginning of my career. I have always had a passion for grooming talents. Whenever I am not on the music scene, I groom talents.”

The showbiz personality also said he didn’t consider himself a musician. He stated, “I might ‘drop’ a single in a year or two from now, but it’s not an active music career. I won’t say I am a musician. I am more like a businessman in the music industry.”
