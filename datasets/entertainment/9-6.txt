Teebillz apologises to OAP Do2dtun over alleged death threats from Tacha’s fans
Tunji Balogun popularly known as Teebillz has apologised to on-air-personality, Oladotun Kayode, aka Do2dtun, who claimed to have been threatened with death after he announced that he would be interviewing disqualified Big Brother Naija housemate, Tacha Akide.

Do2dtun had earlier on Monday taken to his verified Instagram page to announce that he would be hosting Tacha’s first radio interview on Wednesday. No sooner had he shared the information, than fans of the former housemate called him out over the move, claiming that he had criticised her while she was in the BBNaija house.

Amidst the reactions, the OAP via his verified Twitter handle revealed that he had received death threats as a result of the planned interview and even said he was considering pulling the plug on the interview.

He tweeted, “You send me a death threat over a radio interview. I might have to cancel it…this is way out of line. I am done. I didn’t ask for this interview @TeeBillz323 did cos (sic) he runs her management but mehn (sic) this is way out of line.

Stepping into the conversation, Teebillz, who was announced as Tacha’s manager on Friday called on Tacha’s fans, who call themselves Titans to behave themselves better.

He also apologised to Do2dtun, saying, “The management apologizes for any mishap.”

Teebillz said, “Big Brother Naija was a game, a beautiful experience with life lessons for Tacha @symply_tacha , every criticism during the show was according to personal views and everyone owns a right to their opinion. It doesn’t necessarily have to be the same as yours or yours as theirs.

“Now the game is over, its time for reality! Tacha is embarking on a fresh start with a completely different journey.

“There isn’t going to be a journey without the largest fanbase #TITANS, I know your love runs deep for her brand but we have to extend this love to every human, It is important that THE TITANS are also a part of this growth journey. Let’s spread love always ❤

We love you all.”

Do2dtun has since confirmed that the interview would go on as scheduled.
