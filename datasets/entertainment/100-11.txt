Protests may mar documentary on Michael Jackson’s child sexual abuse
The premiere of a documentary, which revealed that the late King of Pop, Michael Jackson allegedly sexually abused some children, at Sundance Film Festival will feature pro-Jackson protesters, reports revealed.

According to the celebrity magazine, TMZ, the local police are getting prepared for possible clashes with the protesters.

Law enforcement sources told TMZ, the Park City Police Department is aware of an anti-documentary protest being organized on social media, so police are going to beef up their presence both inside and outside the premiere with uniformed and undercover officers.

Also, law enforcement are mostly concerned about disruptions taking place during the Q&A portion of the screening –historically, that’s when protesters have caused the biggest disturbances.

However, police won’t stop people from exercising their First Amendment rights, so long as protesters don’t block sidewalks or entrances.

The documentary, “Leaving Neverland,” explores alleged sexual abuse by the King of Pop, and the film is already been criticised by the late singer’s estate. Despite outside pressure to pull the film, Sundance officials say it’s full steam ahead.

All Sundance events have increased security — including bag checks and bomb dogs — but extra resources will be allocated to the MJ screening when it premieres Friday, January 25.
