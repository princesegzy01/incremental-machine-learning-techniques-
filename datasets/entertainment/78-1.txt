My work is based on my values – Femi Jacobs
Tofarati Ige

Actor, Femi Jacobs, is talented and no one would argue that. However, he doesn’t appear in as many movies as some of his colleagues.

According to the entertainer, it is deliberate as he carefully selects the projects he is associated with. Speaking with Sunday Scoop, he said, “I know that an actor is supposed to depict all kinds of roles. But, I also know that not all actors are good for all kinds of roles. The onus is on the actor to pick what he is best suited for. I am not saying that you should not stretch beyond your comfort zone but you should know how to draw the line. Also, every actor should know what they represent. Your work should be based on your values. What are the issues you are most passionate about and what do you want people to remember you for? I am a very intense person. I like my whole being to be involved in whatever I do.”

The actor also stated that one of the perks of being an actor was the appreciation and love shown by people who enjoyed his works. Sharing one of his most memorable moments with fans, Jacobs said, “There was a time I was travelling and I had already checked in at the airport. However, when a certain female fan saw me, she screamed and told me to wait. She ran out of the international airport and went all the way to the car park to drag her husband to come and see me. I waited for them for about 25 minutes and I almost missed my flight.”
