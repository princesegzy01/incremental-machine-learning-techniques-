I didn’t mention MI’s name in ‘diss’ track – CDQ
Olajide Samuel

Rapper, CDQ, shocked many of his fans recently when he seemed to join the ongoing ‘beef’ between his colleagues, MI and Vector.

The Shiga artiste shared a video on social media in which he lambasted MI, claiming that everyone who had been with the diminutive rapper years back had left him.

He also recorded his own version of the Reminisce-inspired OGB4IG, which many believed was a jibe at MI.

However, in an encounter with Sunday Scoop, CDQ maintained that he didn’t mention MI’s name in the song. “I didn’t mention anyone’s name. I only delivered what rap is all about. Sometimes, rap music sounds controversial (and that’s okay). This is not RnB.”

The rapper also stated that ‘diss’ tracks were good for hip hop culture. He said, “Hip hop comes with this by nature, so ‘diss’ is part of the rap culture”.
