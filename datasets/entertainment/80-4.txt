I’m a goofball, make lots of jokes – Simi
Tofarati Ige

Singer, Simisola Ogunleye, known simply as Simi, has added a new feather to her hat. She is now an actress. The Jamb Question singer appeared in Kunle Afolayan’s new movie, Mokalik.

Expressing excitement at being in the film, she told Sunday Scoop, “I am excited to be a part of this project. It helped me to come out of my shell and my comfort zone. I had to speak Yoruba throughout the movie and that was like the hardest thing for me to do. I also had to use some proverbs. But it still felt natural. It didn’t seem like anything was forced.”

Simi also noted that there were similarities in music and acting. She said, “As an artiste, one goes for video shoots and these sometimes take days. So, I was already used to that part of being on set. Many of my music videos have a lot of acting in them as well.”

She stated that although she was an easygoing person, people didn’t take her for granted. “These things come naturally to me. I am a goofball and I make a lot of jokes. I am very light-hearted; I really don’t like stress. But I always make sure I get my job done, even if it means staying up all night. Nobody can take me for granted because I get the work done, and that’s what counts,” she said.

Asked several questions about her marriage to Adekunle Gold, Simi vehemently refused to comment. “I am not going to say anything about my personal life,” she said.
