I’m not good at speaking in church —American comedian Steve Harvey
American comedian, television host, producer, radio personality, actor, and author, Broderick Stephen Harvey, has confessed that he is not good at speaking in church.

He added that he says things that are not pulpit-worthy.

The 62-year-old comedian, popularly known as Steve Harvey, said though his mum had taught him a few things, he still doesn’t do good at speaking in churches.

Trouble started when one of his Twitter followers invited him to come and address the congregation in his church.

“Well I will invite U to speak at my church one of these days…” his Twitter follower Ronnie Mushiwokufa🇿🇼 @rmus05 had tweeted at Harvey.

The comedian tweeted back, “I don’t do good at speaking at churches 😂😁🤣 cause I don’t really belong in a pulpit! You know, I say things that ain’t really pulpit… pulpit-ish… My momma taught me better and I don’t want to go to hell 😂🤣😂 watch what happened next!”
