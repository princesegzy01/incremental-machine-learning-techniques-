Movie marketer, Bashiru Tiamiyu, popularly known as Timolak, has said the menace of piracy in the movie industry is getting worse by the day.

In an interview with Saturday Beats, he noted that pirates now compete to get the highest number of compact discs of his movies in Alaba Market, Lagos.

He said, “We are investing heavily in these movies but piracy is killing us. I began my career in the entertainment industry in 2011. It is full of ups and downs.

“We are still surviving in the business, by the grace of God, but we need the Federal Government to amend the copyright rule.

“Recently, pirates were fighting over my movie in Alaba Market but there was nothing I could do about it.”

When asked about the notion that marketers select the movies they promote based on how popular the actors are, he noted that he only picks works to promote based on the quality of the stories.

He added, “I select the movies to invest in by the quality of the stories; with good equipment; a good story would sell itself.

“The most difficult part about being a movie marketer is finance. There have been instances when some actresses have come to entice me but I ignore them because I don’t mix business with pleasure.

“I have phobia for embarrassment, I don’t want to be called out for any negative reason.”
