Mega 99’s new house ‘unveiled’
Tofarati Ige

Gospel-juju singer, Abel Dosunmu, aka Mega 99, has joined the league of Nigerian artistes who have built their own impressive houses.

This may have come as a surprise to some because of the artiste’s penchant to keep his private life away from the public. Though many know his office in Oshodi, Lagos, they did not know that he had completed a house in the Alakuko area of the state.

However, a glimpse was caught into Mega 99’s private life when his band members organised a birthday party for him at the house.

According to some of the guests, that was the first time they visited the house which the singer had been living in for some time. Even some of his neighbours did not know he was the one living there.
