Being a millionaire won’t affect my relationship with Ike – Mercy, BBN 2019 winner

The winner of the fourth season of Big Brother Naija, Mercy Eke, has insisted that her relationship with a fellow housemate, Ike Onyema, would continue to go on smoothly. The two were fond of each other in the House.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop during the week, Mercy waved aside the insinuation that since she was now richer than Onyema, she might want to explore other options. She said, “I was single before going into the House. But now, you should expect love and friendship (between me and Ike). We would work as partners. Money has nothing to do with the love we share. Money has nothing to do with our relationship; it won’t affect us.”

On what endeared her to him, Mercy said, “Ike is a special person. It is something beyond what I can understand– it was just in him. I think every girl in the House liked him too. I realised that I had feelings for him about the fifth week in the house.”

Eke also maintained that she flaunted her body while in the House because she was confident in her own skin. She stated, “I feel every woman should be at peace with their body. I was comfortable with my body and that was it for me.”

The graduate of Imo State University noted that her focus, for now, would be on her business interests. “My first duty is my business– establishing my clothing brand and putting it out there. But, I want to take things slowly; I am not trying to rush. The immediate thing is for me to nurture my clothing brand and after that, any other thing can follow,” she added.
