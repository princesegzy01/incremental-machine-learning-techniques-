Indomie Big Brother Naija brand ambassador and music producer, Don Jazzy, along with fellow Mavin artiste, Dr Sid, visited the Big Brother Naija house recently, spending some quality time with the housemates.

The visit was for the duo to serve as task masters and superintend the Indomie cooking challenge— ‘My Indomie, My Style Task’, carried out by the housemates.

The first challenge saw the housemates trying to piece together jigsaw puzzles made out of Indomie packs. Puzzle boards were set up in the games arena and housemates were all in a race against time to complete their puzzles. Ike, Khafi and Frodd were the first three to conclude the task.

On completion of the puzzle challenge, each housemate was then handed a customised Indomie basket with various ingredients for them to prepare their unique style of noodles. This task had to be carried out with only two housemates allowed in the kitchen at a time, each with 15 minutes to prepare their individual delight. Khafi and Ike went first, setting the ball rolling for an epic culinary battle.

Each housemate not only presented their own unique meal to Don Jazzy for tasting, but they also accompanied it with fancy rap, dance and other creative additives.

Announcing the winners, Don Jazzy declared to the amazement of housemates and audiences alike that all the housemates would share the prize money. He said, “There is no one style that is the most unique. Everyone’s style is unique to them and so is their Indomie, so all the housemates will share five million naira.”
