R&B singer, Chris Brown, 29, said he would take legal action against his alleged rape victim over defamation of character.

The singer issued a statement on his Instagram account on Tuesday denying the accusation.

“I wanna make it perfectly clear. This is false and a whole lot of CAP!,” he wrote in the all-caps message. “For my daughter and my family, this is so disrespectful and is against my character and morals!!!!” he wrote

Brown’s Parisian lawyer, Raphael Chiche, says, “Chris Brown is free. No lawsuits were filed against him. He vigorously challenges the charges against him. A complaint for slanderous denunciation will be filed tomorrow with the public prosecutor of Paris.’’

The singer claimed not to have been alone with the woman, insisting that he was playing music off his iPhone in the living room of the suite with 20 people around him the entire time the crime was alleged to have occurred.

According to TMZ news, a source in the judicial system of Paris disclosed that the fact that the R&B singer and actor was released with no conditions and free to leave the country is a sign, authorities have no problems with the case.
