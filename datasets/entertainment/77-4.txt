Police arrest suspected killer of rapper Nipsey Hussle
Los Angeles police on Tuesday said they had arrested the man suspected of murdering rapper Nipsey Hussle, ending a two-day manhunt following the Grammy-nominated artist’s shock death.

The LAPD said the suspect, Eric Holder, was in police custody in connection with the fatal shooting, which authorities say was gang-related and personal in nature.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who had blamed “senseless gun violence” for the death of 33-year-old Hussle, voiced hope for “justice that Nipsey’s family and community deserve” as the arrest was announced.

The killing in broad daylight triggered an outpouring of grief in LA and among Hussle’s superstar peers, who hailed both his musical talents and tireless community organizing.

Earlier Tuesday, LA police chief Michel Moore had said the suspect had verbally sparred with Hussle in front of the rapper’s clothing store.

“Holder walked up on multiple occasions and engaged in conversations” with Hussle, the police chief told journalists.

The suspect then “came back armed with a handgun” and fired several times at close range.

On Monday. the LA County coroner’s office had said the rapper died of a gunshot wound to the head.

Both Moore and Garcetti lamented a recent rise in violence in the California metropolis, with the police chief saying: “Nipsey Hussle represents the enormity of the lives we have lost.”

Authorities called for peace in LA, where a Monday evening vigil to Hussle turned ugly when a stampede caused several injuries.

Garcetti hailed Hussle’s legacy of peace, urging the city to come together and continue the rapper’s community building efforts.

“This is about young people of colour being able to have the opportunity in their lives,” Garcetti said.
