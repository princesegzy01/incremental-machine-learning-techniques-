Many Nigerians have continued to make diverse comments over the sudden disqualification of Tacha, one of the more prominent faces in the ongoing Big Brother Naija reality show.

She was disqualified for being physically violent towards a fellow housemate, Mercy. Tacha had been engaged in a shouting match with Mercy, which turned physical after Tacha grabbed Mercy’s hair and she, in turn, tried to defend herself with an electric iron.

A social media user, @kanoel­_fabrics, wrote, “She can now go and ‘pin’ in her father’s bedroom. Nonsense.” Another user, @hair_by_movika_empire, wrote, “‘No leave, no transfer’ has officially been transferred to the permanent site. What a wow!!!” Yet another person, @donpositive wrote, “At least, the Housemates can now breathe fresh air, no odour.”

@Cruncherjokes wrote, “This is s****y, she has done nothing wrong. They both abused each other. Rubbish.” @arin_candie wrote, “Pride goes before a fall.”

@toffyllicious wrote, “I’m so happy right now. Let people know that we are aspiring to build a better society, not a toxic one.” @naijabeautyshop wrote, “This is loud, pride is not confidence. Let’s all learn how to control our mouths, it could be any body. This is an example to learn from.” @president_okiki wrote, “Mr P and Naira Marley are going to endorse her now.” @olive.ive wrote, “This girl obviously has some emotional issues. Hopefully, she will see a psychologist.” @shattynattfoods added, “She needed to go! I’m throwing a party for her disqualification, drink on me fam!!! No more toxic behaviour.”

@simplezinny_collections stated, “It is well. It is not the end of life. Go and do exploits.” @sarima_ wrote, “She used her hand to spoil her game! Hopefully, she learns from this!!” @oyizmarie wrote, “I saw it coming. Both of them should be disqualified.” @cheeamaka_xx wrote, “This is so heartbreaking. I love you regardless. Stay strong.” @b3rants_ added, “We love you babe.”

For her part in the altercation, Mercy got two strikes from Big Brother “for not stepping away from a volatile situation”.

According to the official website of the show, Tacha was accused of losing her temper, leading to her pushing, shoving and pulling Mercy’s hair, which was considered violence.

Big Brother found her guilty of breaking the House rule of physical violence and intent to harm the moment she shoved Mercy, and the moment she pulled her hair on two separate occasions. Biggie deemed that such physical violence had no place in Big Brother’s house’.

Meanwhile, there are just 10 days left in the show.
