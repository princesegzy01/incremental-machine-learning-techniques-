A few days ago, it was revealed that pop star, Tiwa Savage, had left Mavin Records after the expiration of her contract, and had moved to the US-based Universal Records. No sooner had the news hit the Internet than artistes such as Burna Boy and Dammy Krane insinuated that such international deals were a form of slavery.

Burna Boy had written on Snapchat, “I feel so sorry for all you Nigerian artistes jumping into these international deals. You guys don’t know what you’re doing. I will forever be grateful and thankful to my manager/mother for making sure I will never be an international victim. I feel bad for every single one of you. I’m hearing some really crazy s**t out here. I’m so sad for you all.”

Dammy Krane’s post on his Instagram page reads in part, “…no need to concentrate on Yankee market. It’s all about Africa. No black man can make it in America…”

However, a former rave-of-the-moment, Mo’Cheddah, congratulated Savage on the deal. In a chat with Sunday Scoop, she cautioned people to stop trying to undermine Tiwa’s achievements. She said, “I don’t care what other people say, it’s a deal and that’s what’s important. It is good news and that is why I congratulated her. People should just be happy for her instead of trying to undermine what she’s doing. We shouldn’t even be talking about that.”
