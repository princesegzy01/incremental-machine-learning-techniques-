Funmi Iyanda finds love in filmmaking
Tofarati Ige

Actors, Ozzy Agu (Adrian) and Zainab Balogun (Ada), are a quintessential couple with a picture-perfect life until the façade starts to crumble when it was revealed to Ada by her husband’s disgruntled colleague that Adrian is gay. This and more played out in a new movie titled, Walking with Shadows.

The feature length movie, which was produced by media personality, Funmi Iyanda’s Oya Media, was recently premiered at the British Film Institute’s London Film Festival, and it got a warm reception. Adapted for the screen from the 2005 novel by Jude Dibia, the movie was written and directed by Irish filmmaker Aoife O’Kelly, herself making her debut with long form filmmaking.

In the movie, Agu retains his easy, likeable presence, while also imbibing his character’s pain, despair and loneliness, as he navigates a world that would rather have him live a lie.

Balogun also steps up her game, supporting Agu’s Adrian, yet not stealing his thunder.

Other actors in the movie include Funlola Aofiyebi-Raimi, Ade Laoye, Judith Audu, Ayoola Ayolola and Adunni Ade, among others.
