Tofarati Ige

Actor and movie producer, Ibrahim Yekini, popularly known as Itele, is currently basking in the euphoria that his latest movie, Kesari, has generated.

Speaking with Sunday Scoop on what inspired the movie, he said, “I was inspired by the popular Black Panther movie. The action scenes in that movie were enough motivation for me to toe the same path and produce what has been widely embraced across the country.”

Itele, who wrote, directed and played the lead role in the action-packed movie, said it had surpassed his expectations. “I can’t even explain how I am feeling now because the movie has gone farther than I ever thought. I have received calls from every part of the world commending the job and the brains behind it. The movie recorded feats that had never happened in the history of Yoruba movies.

“I could not contain my joy and excitement when the movie had one million views within 20 days of its upload.”

Itele, who was a professional boxer before joining the movie industry, maintained that he won many bouts but lost one before acting came calling. He also stated that he wasn’t bothered it took him so long before he could break even in the industry. “Coming a long way is good because one had been working and hoping that one day, people would appreciate one and notice the level of work one had done over the years. However, that does not equate success. It is only God that crowns one’s efforts in life. I think it is just my time and I am extremely happy about the unfolding realities of my life and career.”
