I can collaborate with Tiwa Savage – Yemi Alade
Olushola Ricketts

Although the two artistes don’t say it in clear terms, it is obvious there is a silent rivalry between Yemi Alade and Tiwa Savage.

But Alade, who recently featured American artiste, Rick Ross, in the remix of her song, O My Gosh, gave the condition on which she could collaborate with Tiwa Savage to make a song. She told Sunday Scoop, “If it is the will of God (collaborating with Tiwa Savage). We, female artistes, are all doing great things and putting music out there. Being the biggest female artiste or not, I am very happy where I’m and I’m happy for other females in the industry.”

On the alleged beef between her and Tiwa Savage, he said the question was irrelevant, saying, “We are here for the music; so, let’s keep our focus on the music.”

Alade also stated that she was satisfied with her growth musically. She said, “I believe so much in growth and the process. When I saw an opportunity to collaborate with Rick Ross, I grabbed it. Working with him was an amazing experience; he is an inspiration. Despite my success, I still want to tour the world, reach out to new places and make more music.”

Saying she was not under any pressure to get married, she said she wouldn’t hide it from the public when it was time for marriage.
