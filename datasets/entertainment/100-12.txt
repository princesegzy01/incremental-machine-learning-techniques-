Tekno drops ‘Woman’ in celebration of the fairer sex

The 26-year-old Bauchi born song writer and dancer from Ebonyi State glorified women in the four minutes and 18 seconds song.

The Jogodo crooner in the lyrics of the song explained that women were not just meant to be in the kitchen or excluded from important meetings, but that he would like his lady to be by his side and to also achieve great feats.

The Pana crooner further stressed that a woman could be a helper, lover, teacher and the president of a country.

In November 2018, Tekno, also referred to as Slim Daddy, had a temporary damage to his vocal cord due to excessive strain he had put on it over time.

The Davido’s If producer was born into a family of five (four boys and a girl) but he grew up variously in Kaduna, Nasarawa and Abuja because his father was a soldier.

In 2012, he performed his song Onye Ne Kwu, a remix of Ice Prince’s Oleku, at an event organised by comedian Julius Agu in Abuja.

The performance attracted Iyanya and Ubi Franklyn of Made Men Music Group.

In October 2013, he was signed to the music group and he released several songs which include, Dance, Anything, Duro, Wash, and many more.

The song, Woman, is his first single in 2019.
