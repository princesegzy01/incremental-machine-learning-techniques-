It was a time for celebration recently as the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, Surulere District, Lagos, (Ayo Ni O), held her annual lecture in honour of the late Prophet Gabriel Olubunmi Fakeye, the former General Leader of the church.

While the choir members were singing, one of the special guests, the General Overseer, Love of Christ Generation Church, Rev Mother Esther Abimbola Ajayi, popularly known as Iya Adura, sent the audience into laughter with her ‘shaku shaku’ dance steps. Though her moves were not close to perfection, she did it with so much joy and courage.

During the event also, she spoke about the great work of Fakeye, singling out his humility and selfless works.
