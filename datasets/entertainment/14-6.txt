I’m comfortable with romantic scenes, not nudity – Debbie Shokoya
Olajide Samuel

Ogun State-born actress, Debbie Shokoya’s profile is steadily rising in the Yoruba-speaking genre of the movie industry.

Shokoya, who cuts the picture of a daring person, told Sunday Scoop that while she is comfortable with romantic scenes, she wouldn’t go naked to interpret a role. She said, “I am comfortable with romantic scenes if they don’t warrant me going naked or semi-nude. If it’s the kisses and the hugs, I think I am fine with that. However, if it has to do with caressing and more intimate acts, I might not be able to do it.”

The former television presenter also clarified what she meant in an interview where she was quoted criticising men who wear same underwear twice.

“That wasn’t what I meant. When the interview was published, some people thought I meant a man shouldn’t put on underwear he has worn before, but I never said that. I only said I cannot stand a man wearing the same underwear. For example, if I am with my boyfriend and he puts on a particular boxer and we made love thereafter; if we want to make love the next day and he puts on the same underwear, I might not be comfortable with it. I would love to see something new,” she added.

Sharing what she won’t do in the name of fashion, the actress said, “When it comes to fashion, I love being simple, and there are some clothes I cannot wear. I cannot go naked trying to be fashionable.”
