Fojo Media Production has completed the shooting of its romantic comedy, ‘The Reunion.’

The movie tells the story of four friends from high school, who reunite to plan the 50th anniversary of their alma mater. As a battle of superiority stirs up and issues from the past are revisited, secrets are revealed that threaten to tear up their seemingly perfect lives.

The star-studded cast includes Mercy Johnson, Tana Adelana, Mercy Aigbe, Lillian Esoro, Jide Kosoko, Chioma Emeruah Chigul, Frederick Leonard, Jaiye Kuti, Femi Jacobs, and Lateef Adedimeji.

According to the Executive Producer and CEO Fojo Media Productions, Faith Ojo, through the movie, Nigeria’s economy can receive a boost.

“I hope that the young and old embrace this movie, as this will motivate me to bring in investors from the United States into the Nigerian movie industry to improve our economy,” she said.

The businesswoman said she has a vision to create jobs for Nigerians. “I have always been very passionate about African arts and not just Nigerian movies, hence, I came back to run the business and know its nitty-gritty,” she said.

Also, according to the producer and director of The Reunion, Thomas Odia, the movie shows people the reason why they should not judge a book by its cover.

“Today in our society, we have a lot of people who pretend to be who they are not, so be yourself and what is yours will come your way,” he said.
