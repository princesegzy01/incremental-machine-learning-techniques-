Olajide Samuel

Singer, Seyi Shay, has been in the news for her new collaboration with American artiste, Teyana Taylor. Shay noted that she featured Taylor in Gimme Love Remix, because of her personality and style of music.

Speaking in a chat with Sunday Scoop, Seyi Shay said, “I like her style, music and personality. I saw her perform last year in Atlanta, US, and I asked my managers to get her for me. They contacted her and she obliged. It was pretty easy. She is very pleasant to work with.

“My team In LA refined the second verse of the song for her and she recorded it beautifully. We did not have much time to shoot the video, so it happened pretty quickly in New York soon after.”

Seyi Shay, who loves to flaunt her sex appeal, added that a sexy woman was a damsel who was intelligent and aware of who she was. She stated, “My definition of a sexy woman is one who is intelligent, knowledgeable of who she is and a self-made boss.”

On whether the Nigerian government was doing enough for entertainers, the singer said, “Not really. More can be done for sure.”
