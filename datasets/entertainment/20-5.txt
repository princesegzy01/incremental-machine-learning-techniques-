Dayo Adeola

Talented and vivacious teenage singer, Iseoluwa Abidemi, exemplifies the saying that age is nothing but a number. Signed to Wole Oni Music Production, the singer recently released a new single, ‘Mo ti G’oke’, that has been enjoying considerable airplay.

Speaking on what inspired the song, she told SATURDAY BEATS, “I always love to listen to and make good music that changes the lives of my fans. The song is an inspiring tune which is meant to motivate listeners that they can succeed if they put their best into whatever they’re doing.”

Maintaining that her age was an asset, not a barrier, she said, “I believe that I have what it takes to shine in the Nigeria music industry. And with the guidance of my manager, Wole Oni, I am sure that we would make a lot of waves in the country and the world at large.”

Her manager and CEO of WOMP, an arm of Instinct Production, Wole Oni, also stated that Iseoluwa had all it took to succeed in the music industry.

He said, “Iseoluwa is set to turn the world right side up with her music. And she has proved that already with her newly released single, which is one of the songs in her anticipated album to be released at her forthcoming concert in November. Her style and approach challenge the norm and defy the usual. Once you listen to her, you would be so enthralled and captivated by her vocal ability.”
