Singing duo, Dalyboy and Bennie, who are currently based in the United States have revealed to Saturday Beats that the sole reason they ventured into entertainment was to promote love in relationships through their music.

“Our goal is to promote and encourage love in healthy relationships. We educate our listeners by giving pointers and showing them that it’s okay to live freely with your partner.

“As the Bible says, love your neighbours as you love yourself. Many relationships and marriages failed because of a lack of respect and love.

“Love is like a drug, once you have experienced it, you will crave it. We all have to have it and we all need it.

“We sing about real life issues, relationship, and pass messages through our songs of how couples could respond to issues they are facing in relationship and marriage,” they said.

Speaking on how they met and began doing music together, Bennie said that everything happened by chance.

“We met originally for business through a client. Music happened by mistake while we both were joking around in the car while listening to a beat Dalyboy made.

“And that’s how’s Drippin was created. Our songs are inspired by our lives and our experiences together,” she said.
