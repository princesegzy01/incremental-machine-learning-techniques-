The Iyase of Asaba, Chief Patrick Onyeobi, has disclosed that the Delta State capital is ready to host more than 500,000 guests, including tourists, during the annual Ezigbo Festival, which is scheduled to take place in September, 2019.

Onyeobi stated this on Thursday, while receiving the organisers of the festival in his residence.

He noted that each year the festival, celebrated in Asaba for over three centuries, often attracted natives of Asaba resident within and tourists from different parts of the world.

The Iyase described Asaba as one of the hotspots of the Nigerian hospitality industry due to its historical significance and its reputation for being one of the most secured cities in the country.

He also emphasised the characteristic warmth of its people and the city’s location on the bank of the River Niger, which he described as the gateway to the eastern part of the country.

He said, “Delta State is ready to host over 500,000 indigenes, guests and tourists, starting from 13th – 20th of September, 2019 for this year’s Ezigbo festival. The festival which has been celebrated by the people of Asaba and environs for over 300 years is being rebranded to showcase the tourism potentials and attractions that it affords”

The Chief Executive Officer of Machine Company, one of the organisers of the festival, Mr. Seun Obey, said the firm was working hard to ensure that the 2019 edition of the festival would be exceptional.

He said the company was working with other organisations in the festival organisers’ committee to attract the much-needed corporate sponsorship for the festival.
