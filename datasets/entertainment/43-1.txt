Gospel musician, Bolaji Olarenwaju, popularly known as Big Bolaji, has said he is still learning how to strike a balance between finding time for his family and doing well in his career as a musician. In an interview with Saturday Beats, Olanrewaju said, “I’m still in the learning process but having great mentors has helped me greatly in that regard.

“My advice to up-and-coming musicians is that they should stay true to who they are and know God themselves, and not through any person or medium. They should also take the time to develop their relationship with their maker.

“Ever since I became a musician, all my expectations have being met. It’s been great; seeing as God unfolds his blessings over me. It’s been God and God all the way, I don’t have any formula, but I know that committing all I do to the lord and staying true to my given instructions have helped me greatly.”

The artist, who is currently gearing up for the upcoming anniversary of his programme, ‘Turn it up with B,’ noted that the programme had been a blessing to performing artistes and guests.
