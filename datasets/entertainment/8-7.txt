The 2019 Felabration festival to commemorate the life and times of music icon, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, was one of the highlights of the week.

The annual event, which was tagged, ‘From Lagos With Love’, held at the New Afrikan Shrine, Ikeja, Lagos, from October 14 ends tomorrow.

As expected, the Shrine was a beehive of activities as fans of the Kuti dynasty turned out in their numbers to celebrate the abami eda.

The event, which also marked the 81st posthumous birthday of Fela, witnessed performances from notable artistes such as Burna Boy, CDQ, 2017 Big Brother Naija winner, Efe Ejaba, Martinsfeels, Lyta, Bella Shmurda, Maka, Killy, Kholi, Tzay, Moxziey, FMG, Sim, Samiyo, and Steve Black, among others.

Asides the daily concerts, there were also other events such as secondary schools’ debates, dance competitions, and art exhibitions.

Over a decade after Fela’s death, music enthusiasts have continued to eulogise him for what he stood for.
