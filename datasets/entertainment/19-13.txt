Big Brother House intense, emotionally challenging –Esther
Olajide Samuel

Prior to Big Brother Naija 2019 ‘Pepper Dem’ edition, Esther Agunbiade, was just a regular Nigerian with dreams and aspirations to make it big in the entertainment industry. Fondly called Queen Esther by her fans, the former BBN housemate described the Big Brother House as intense and emotionally challenging.

In an encounter with Saturday Beats, she said, “My experience in the Big Brother House was emotionally challenging and pretty intense. It was also enlightening and exciting. I participated in activities I could never have dreamt of doing. I did many things I would never have done if not for the show. I ticked a lot of things I didn’t know were on my bucket list. Now, I have a better perspective on life. I have improved and become a better person in the way I relate with people and in other areas. That was an amazing thing to have experienced in the house.”

Esther also stated that she had a number of memorable moments in the BBNaija house. She added, “Winning the Head of House challenge twice and being the first female to win it twice were my unforgettable experiences. It showed that I am smart, intelligent and determined.”

On the key lessons she learnt on the show, she said, “I learnt that one can do things one never thought one could do, especially when one is put in a particular place where one has to do those things. I did a lot of tasks and challenges in the House that I had never done before. I made hair, sewed clothes, recycled waste materials, and did some dance routines. I also learnt to be courteous and careful about the people around me.”
