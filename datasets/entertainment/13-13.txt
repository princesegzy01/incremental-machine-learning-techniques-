A fan squeezed my butt in Australia — Maheeda
Singer, Maheeda, has recounted how a fan once squeezed her butt in faraway Australia.

Describing the experience in a chat with Sunday Scoop, she said, “About six years ago, while coming back from a show in Australia, a fan hugged me and squeezed my butt so hard. I did not know whether to slap him or let it go. I guess it was my fault because of the kind of pictures and videos I post on social media. However, I did not really like what the fan did because a lady should be given her due respect no matter who she is. So, for me, that has been my most embarrassing moment with a fan.”

On how she would behave if she were a contestant in the Big Brother Naija reality television show, Maheeda said, “I don’t think it would be a good idea for me to be in the House because I am too naughty. For me to be myself, I would have to show my naughty side. If I were in the House, I think I would have sex with all the guys there.”

The former gospel singer also said that contrary to what many may think, she was making a lot of business moves. She added, “I have been very busy and I thank God for my man who has opened my eyes to other businesses apart from entertainment. I now invest in shares and I think that is good for my daughter’s future. If there is any little money left, I would probably put a song out there and just enjoy myself. But I don’t think I want to stress my 45-year-old body because I don’t think I can cope with not sleeping and all the rigours that musicians go through.”
