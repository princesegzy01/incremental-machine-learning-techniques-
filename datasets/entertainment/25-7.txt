Contemporary musician, Seun ‘S B’ Bankole is gearing up to stage a big show in Lagos tagged, ‘S B Live Invibe Concert’.

Working in conjunction with Eyecandy and 1908 Connect, event and concert production agencies, the artiste has promised to provide an unforgettable experience for guests come Sunday, October 6, 2019.

In a chat with Saturday Beats, S B explained the reason for the event. He said, “The concert is a one-day programme of fabulous musical entertainment and other fun-filled activities. It is targeted at promoting and celebrating my band and me. It will also feature a collection of extraordinarily talented Nigerian music icons. Also, a sizeable part of the concert’s proceeds will go towards helping to institutionalise a benevolence fund for underprivileged people who are talented through the S B Live Foundation, which is my own way of giving back to society.

“SLIC is planned as the biggest all-in-one music concert in Nigeria, and it will attract thousands of attendees from across the country. However, before the concert, I will be going on a US tour in September.”

S B who graduated from the Lagos Polytechnic where he studied Banking and Finance, has been in the industry for over a decade, performing across the world with his band, the SB Live Band. His latest song, ‘Orire’, released few weeks ago is currently enjoying fair rotation on the airwaves.
