Up-and-coming singer, Martha James, aka Jay-pink, says despite the daily challenges she faces in the industry, she has never considered giving up.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, Jay-Pink also said she had always looked up to Joromi singer, Simi Ogunleye, for inspiration. She said, “Music has always been a part of me. Right from childhood, I have always liked to write songs with everything I see around me. I am inspired by the success story of people such as Simi and Beyonce. I love Simi’s personality and music.”

The graduate of Mass Communication from the Kogi State University said she wrote her first song in primary school but became a professional singer in 2015.

She stated, “I have recorded about 10 songs and released five. It has not been easy because Nigeria is blessed with many talented artistes. Getting sponsors is tough and things are even harder for women.

“I just released a new song titled, Home. But songwriting is not easy as well. However, I count myself lucky because I have people who believe in me. I have people who download my songs and share them on different online platforms. This gives me the conviction that I’m doing the right thing.”
