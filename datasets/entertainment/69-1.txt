I am shameless – Tonto Dikeh
Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja

Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, says she is a shameless person and therefore will not be cowed by the expectations of people.

Dikeh, while chatting with radio presenter, Daddy Freeze, said she would continue to fight dirty with her ex-husband and father of her son, Olakunle Churchill, because “she has no shame”.

The actress said most actresses marry ‘Yahoo’ boys (Internet fraudsters) in a desperate search for love only to realise their mistake afterward.

She said, “This is the thing most of our actresses go through but nobody says anything. We get so lonely and when we need somebody to hold onto, we get into the wrong hands. Half of us have married ‘Yahoo’ boys.

“Most of them are just walking away because it is too shameful for them but I am shameless; I will talk because I don’t have any shame in my life. I don’t because if this man is arrested tomorrow, they will link him to me because I was once married to him.”

Dikeh claimed she was the one who paid for the wedding ceremony with her husband in 2015.

She said even the hotel rooms booked for the wedding were paid for by one of her male friends.

The actress also said she did no wrong by changing her son’s surname from her husband’s to her own.

She said she was the one that had been paying the school fees of her son, King, and therefore had the right to change his name.

Dikeh said contrary to reports, her former husband did not buy her a house but they all lived in a rented apartment.

When asked if there was anything good about her short marriage to Churchill, Dikeh said there was nothing good about the relationship because it was built on lies.
