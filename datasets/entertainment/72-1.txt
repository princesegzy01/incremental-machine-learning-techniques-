Money, not marriage on my mind – Ruby Gyang
Olushola Ricketts

Singer, Ruby Gyang, has said that marriage is not on her priority list for now. Refusing to comment on the possibility of getting married to her baby daddy, Jesse Jagz, Gyang said, “I will eventually get married but it is not now. I am trying to make good music and money. My daughter is a major reason I am working hard because I want to show her that she can achieve anything she sets out to do.

“I have yet to achieve my full potential in music. I have experienced challenges but I have learnt in life that we all have different paths; so, I don’t compare my growth with others. For me, music is a lifetime thing. I will continue to push forward.”

Speaking about her monthly show, O’ Live, Gyang noted that she started the concert due to her desire to create a platform that would cater to artistes like her. She said, “Many events I attend are focused on the afrobeats or pop market. I wanted a platform where people like me could perform. I also desired to organise a great show for my audience because I felt they were worth giving my best.

“I started this live show last year and we have had about nine events, which ended with a festival. The show is holding coming Saturday.”
