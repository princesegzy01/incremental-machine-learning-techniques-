Popular dancer, Korra Obidi’s recent photos make pregnancy looks easy and fun. Needless to say, she seems to be enjoying every day as a pregnant woman.

Obidi, who is married to a Caucasian, told Sunday Scoop that she was in love with her new looks, including the shape of her buttocks. She said, “Every entertainer fears that pregnancy might make her lose relevance. However, life goes on. If my fans cannot appreciate my growth, then they were never my fans to begin with.

“I just started having fun. I love my new look, my baby bump, my huge tits and my buttocks now. My real fans love it too; a true fan’s love is unconditional

Reacting to a former Big Brother Naija contestant, Gifty’s attack on pregnant women dancing, Obidi said, “Research shows that dancing is a great cardio exercise during pregnancy. I have not stopped dancing because I became pregnant. Literacy is essential. Before putting out your opinions about a subject, do the adequate research.”

Commending her husband’s support for her, she said once one was married to one’s true love, the burden of pregnancy would be shared.
