Ed Sheeran doubles fortune but Lloyd Webber is richest UK musician
Broadway giant Andrew Lloyd Webber has leapfrogged Beatles legend Paul McCartney to become Britain’s wealthiest musician with an estimated fortune of £820 million ($1 billion, 953 million euros), according to the Sunday Times Rich List, published Thursday.

Lloyd Webber, 71, wrote the scores for musicals “Cats”, “The Phantom of the Opera” and “Evita” and was described by the New York Times as “the most commercially successful composer in history”.

McCartney and his US wife Nancy Shevell’s fortune has dropped by an estimated £70 million to £750 million, with Irish band U2 in third place with a joint worth of £583 million.

Singer/songwriter Elton John, subject of new Hollywood biopic “Rocketman”, was in fourth place, with £320 million, while Rolling Stones icons Mick Jagger and Keith Richards occupied the fourth and fifth spots.
