I didn’t mean to offend anybody by praising Cee-C –Uti Nwachukwu

Actor and TV presenter, Uti Nwachukwu, appeared to have bitten more than he could chew some days ago when he stated that Big Brother Nigeria 2018 contestant, Cee-C, was the most successful alumnus of the reality show of all time. However, after a lot of backlash, Uti recanted and rephrased his statement, saying that Cee-C was ‘one of the’ most successful former housemates of the competition.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, Uti maintained that he wasn’t trying to incite anybody with his statement. He said, “I’m not here to offend anybody. I’m all about peace and love. If anybody was offended, I just need to let them know that there was no harm meant. I made that statement with a free mind. It had nothing to do with anybody. But it apparently made other people feel uncomfortable, and that was why I rephrased the statement.”

On most Big Brother housemates not having successful careers outside the competition, Uti said, “I don’t really notice that. But not all the winners want to pursue a life in front of the cameras. And when you’re not doing things in front of the camera, it feels like you’re not doing well. People are doing things in different spheres of life, and it doesn’t mean they are not making headway. Just because one is not successful in front of the camera doesn’t mean one is not doing well.”
