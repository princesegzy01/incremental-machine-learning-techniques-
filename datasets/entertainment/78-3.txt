I’m not a one-hit wonder, says Mr Real
Olushola Ricketts

With the release of the song, Legbegbe, in 2017, Okafor Victor, better known as Mr Real, seemed poised for a promising career. But at the moment, that is no longer certain.

However, Mr Real told Sunday Scoop that there was still a lot he had to offer the music industry. He stated, “Anyone who thinks I’m a one-hit wonder is not God because I know what I have and I believe in myself. If you always expect your next song to be bigger than the last, you may not release songs again. 2Baba has released many great songs but none is bigger than African Queen. As artistes, we just have to continue doing our best. It is only God who makes hit songs. For me, I think the most important thing is to remain relevant.”

Explaining why he released an R&B song, Antidote, after a street anthem such as Legbegbe, he stated that he wanted Nigerians to see another side of him. He said, “I am a versatile artiste. I want people to know that I don’t do street songs alone. They should not be surprised if I do fuji or any other genre of music. But I don’t plan to leave street music; my next single will be a street vibe.”

Meanwhile, Mr Real also admitted that he made a lot of money last year and attended many international shows. He said, “I had a good year in 2018. Legbegbe made me travel out of the country for shows. I deliberately waited for a while before dropping another single because I wanted people to digest Legbegbe well.”
