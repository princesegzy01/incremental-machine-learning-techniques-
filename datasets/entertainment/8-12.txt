VIDEO: Cobhams Asuquo’s wife, Ojuolape, reveals how she discovered son’s blindness
Mrs Ojuolape Asuquo, the wife of musician Cobhams Asuquo, has revealed the moment she found out that her then newborn son was blind.

She made this revelation in the latest episode of Tito Idakula’s vlog titled My Jesus Experience. Idakula is the wife of musician, Bez.

In the interview which is available on the Vlog’s YouTube channel, Mrs Asuquo said that she had a smooth pregnancy and fast labour. However, four months after birth, her doctor dropped the words, “He is not following” during a visit to the clinic.

“That is his eyes are not following. I was like, ‘what do you mean, he’s not following?’ You know, suddenly as a mother, your heart just starts palpitating. He (doctor) is actually my gynaecologist. I went to see him. He was so distracted from what he and I were talking about,” Mrs Asuquo said.

“He was like, ‘How old is he?’ I told him. He’s not following. The concern on his face gave me concerned too. So, he sends me off to a paediatrician,” she added.

The Asuquos got married in 2010.
