Shows I perform at are not advertised – Bez
Olushola Ricketts

It is not a secret that musician, Bez Idakula, known simply as Bez, doesn’t do commercial/mainstream music. This has led many to say that he could be struggling to get lucrative shows in Nigeria.

But in a chat with Sunday Scoop, Bez said he had never been short of shows. He stated, “People don’t know about the events I do; you need to call my manager to find out about the kinds of jobs I get on a regular basis. We do mostly corporate events because of my style of music. From January to March, we have done quite a number of events but they don’t advertise them because they are very exclusive. Also, we do commercial events when I am invited. But if you look through my Instagram page, you will realise that I don’t talk about these things because of my private personality. God has been so gracious to me; I cannot even explain it myself.”

Explaining why he didn’t hold a concert last year, he said he was working on a music hub, which took his time. The singer said, “I just launched my music hub three weeks ago. All through last year, I was trying to set it up and I felt I would be able to do my concert too but it didn’t work out that way. This year, I will have a festival for the hub and still hold my concert later in the year.”

Bez also said he had concluded plans to drop an album in May. He stated, “My album is ready and I plan to hold a listening party for the creative community in a few days. I will release the album sometime in May.

“I am not a conventional artiste and I do things differently. I don’t need to release a single before I put out an album. Beyoncé released an album without a single and it has done well.”
