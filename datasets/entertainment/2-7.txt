Africa’s foremost hair extension brand; Kanekalon, hosted the fourth edition of its annual Arigato, an exclusive event to appreciate partners and also stylists in the Nigerian hair industry.

It all went down on Saturday, November 2, 2019, at Timesquare Events Centre, Ikeja Lagos and was massively attended by icons in the industry including Kanekalon’s partners- Darling & X-pression, past and present Kanekalon Queens, five different hair associations in Lagos and big shots in the hair industry.

MC Mario and Bella Rose who severed as comperes at the event welcomed guests to an exciting show with deserving entertainment, good food, giveaways and many more. In the spirit of the celebration, guests were entertained with the captivating history of Kanekalon while models walked the runway to showcase the versatility of the brand’s products.

Kanekalon is the premium fiber found in darling and X-pression hair extensions. The brand has remained women’s favourite for long, thanks to the outstanding qualities; its soft and silky texture, diversity of colours to choose from and most importantly its flame-retardant quality (when the source of fire is removed, the fire goes off).

After hours of merrymaking, , Manager, African Marketing Team Kanekalon, Yukiyo Oda, rose before the distinguished guests to give a heartwarming vote of thanks.
