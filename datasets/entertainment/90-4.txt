It’s sad actors refused to work with me because I’m new -Faith Ojo

A movie producer, Faith Ojo, has lamented the shabby treatment she received from some Nollywood stars when she approached them to feature in her forthcoming movie, The Reunion.

Speaking with Sunday Scoop, Ojo said, “We tried to work with many actors on this movie but they declined because they didn’t know me or the director. I felt sad when I heard this. I am only trying to contribute to society and these people are trying to rubbish my efforts. Even if you are yet to work with a producer, there is always a first time.

“There is also a need to give everyone an opportunity to make it in this country. My decision to venture into movie production is not to help myself but to improve society and create jobs for the younger ones.”

She added, “I have always been passionate about African arts. This is not the first time I would be investing in the movie industry. I was once defrauded but I learnt my lessons and I have decided to do things by myself. I plan to invest more money in cinema movies and television series.”
