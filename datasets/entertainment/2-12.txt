American rapper, T.I. courts controversy after saying he takes daughter for annual virginity tests
American rapper, T.I. has been getting a lot of reactions to his comment that he takes his 18-year-old daughter, Deyjah Harris to the gynaecologist each year to check if her hymen is “still intact.”

T.I. whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr said this during a podcast released on Tuesday.

When the conversation turned to parenting and “the sex talk,” the rapper mentioned his daughter, Deyjah and said “Right after her birthday, we celebrate, then usually like the day after the party, she’s enjoying the gifts, I put a sticky note on the door: ‘Tomorrow. 9:30.'”

T.I. revealed that Harris’s annual trips to the gynaecologist to “check her hymen” began after her 16th birthday.

According to Washington Post, T.I. said his daughter’s doctor requires her to sign a waiver allowing him to see the results of her examination.

“So we’ll go and sit down and the doctor will come and talk, and the doctor’s maintaining a high level of professionalism,” T.I. said. “He’s like, ‘Well you know, sir, I have to, to share information’ — I’m like, ‘Deyjah, they want you to sign this so we can share information. Is there anything you would not want me to know? See, Doc? Ain’t no problem.’ ”

“I say, ‘Look doc — she don’t ride no horses, she don’t ride no bikes, she don’t play no sports, man — just check the hymen, please, and give me back my results expeditiously.”

He added, “I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.”

T.I.’s comments have unleashed an outpouring of reactions.

#TI People are complaining about some rapper I never heard of, getting his daughter’s hymen regularly checked to see if she is still a virgin I’m also concerned that a gynecologist would take any part in this type of behaviour.
