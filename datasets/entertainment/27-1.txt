On Rema’s Afrimma hat trick
Mavin signee, Divine Ikubor, popularly known as Rema, has continued to stamp his presence on the music industry with his talent and unique style. The Dumebi singer caps up an amazing debut year with three nominations at the African Muzik Magazine Awards. The hitmaker has been nominated in three categories—Song of the Year, Afrimma Video of the Year and Best Newcomer.

Ever since he came on the scene, Rema, who has had over 50 million views with his two EPs, Rema and Freestyle, on the Internet, has consistently wowed the music industry, thus it came as no surprise that he had been noticed by one of the biggest African music awards in Diaspora.

Other big names on the nominees’ list this year include Nigeria’s Burnaboy, Wizkid, Davido and Yemi Alade; Tanzania’s Diamond Platnumz; South Africa’s Cassper Nyovest; Ghana’s Sarkodie, among others.

Billed to take place in Dallas, Texas, in October, Afrimma is set to celebrate the beauty of African music, culture and artistry, and will honour top entertainers of African descent such as artistes, artiste managers, producers, video directors, DJs and cultural influencers.

Catering to a wide variety of music genres including afrobeats, assiko, bongo, decale, funana, genge, highlife, hiplife, kwaito, lingala and soukous, this year’s edition of the ceremony is the sixth one and promises to be a star-studded event that would attract premium guests from all over the world.
