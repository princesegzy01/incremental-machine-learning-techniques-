Nollywood shouldn’t be compared with Hollywood –Okey Bakassi
Olushola Ricketts

There is always the temptation to compare the quality of movies produced in Nollywood with those made in Hollywood. But top comedian, Okechukwu Onyegbule, aka Okey Bakassi, has described it as an unfair comparison.

The comedian told Sunday Scoop that Nollywood is unique in its own way. He stated, “Nobody can tell our stories better than us. Comparing Nollywood with Hollywood is unfair. Hollywood has been around for a while and they are telling their stories the way they want to.”

The comedian stressed that the two movie industries were operating in different environments. “Technology-wise, Nollywood is behind Hollywood, but that doesn’t mean we are not doing well. There is still a lot of room for improvement. All we need to do is partner with other developed industries because we have good stories we can share with them.”
