Female gospel musician, Nike Akilapa was filled with gratitude as she shared some of the challenges that came with her dream of becoming a gospel singer. Despite the fact that she believed that she was called by God to propagate His gospel through her voice, she told Saturday Beats that she was shocked when some ministers of God tried to discourage her at the early stage of her career.

“I was discouraged when I started my career in the music industry. Some ministers of God did not encourage me; they used to allocate time to gospel artistes based on their level of fame. When we performed in churches, we ween’t getting paid despite the fact that we had to spend money on logistics. Also, some of my family members were not in support of my dream, but when I started attaining fame, they gave me their full support. Being a gospel artiste has opened doors for me, I have had the opportunity to eat and dine with important people in the country.

“My recent album was to celebrate how God has saved me; he rescued me from financial challenges. I was surprised because he sent divine helpers my way,” she told Saturday Beats.
