KSA, Pasuma, Olamide thrill participants at Ariya Repete’s grand finale
King Sunday Ade, Pasuma, Olamide and Taye Currency made sure Friday, August 9, 2019, was a memorable one for participants at the grand finale of the 2019 Ariya Repete programme held at the Ikeja City Mall, Lagos.

The event, sponsored by Goldberg Lager, saw finalists battle for a cash prize of N20m, before three winners emerged.

Hosted by Cool FM presenter, Do2dtun, and Yoruba actor, Odunlade Adekola, the event was a delight as the contestants made it a difficult task for the judges to pick the winners.

KSA, widely regarded for his contribution to the growth of juju music in Nigeria, said it was important to give budding talents the opportunities to showcase themselves.

He stated, “What Goldberg has done for the South-West states is to identify itself as a part of us. It has shown that indeed, it has the Yoruba youths in mind, and that is a sign of respect for our culture.

Addressing the audience, Olamide noted that it was a night he would not forget in a hurry. He said, “New artistes were born tonight and established acts like myself enjoyed the baptism.”

A senior brand manager, Goldberg and Life Lager, Maria Shadeko, said the brand was a reflection of the Yoruba pride and culture.

“Since inception, we have always identified with the culture of South-West. A unique group of people revered for their values of respect, conviviality and enterprise. Our respect and love for the people are highlighted in every step the brand takes, be it in music or other touch points,” he said.
