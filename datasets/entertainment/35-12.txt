Prosecutor demands jail for US rapper A$AP Rocky
A Stockholm prosecutor Friday demanded a jail sentence for US rapper A$AP Rocky over a street brawl that has caught the attention of US President Donald Trump and led fans to call for a boycott of Swedish brands like Ikea.

The 30-year-old rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was arrested on July 3 along with three other people following a brawl in Stockholm on June 30, which saw him and his crew embroiled in a fight with a 19-year-old plaintiff.

His trial at Stockholm District court entered it’s third and expected final day on Friday, with witnesses including his bodyguard taking the stand.

Mayers earlier pleaded not guilty to assault and told the court he had acted in self-defence in the brawl, which was partly captured on videos.

But prosecutor Daniel Suneson told the court in his closing arguments that the accused did not seem “scared” as he had claimed, and argued that there was never a need for self-defence.

“I don’t see how anything but prison is up for discussion,” Suneson said.

“The court should reach the conclusion that the assault… should have a penalty of about six months.”
