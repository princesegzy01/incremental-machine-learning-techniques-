Olajide Samuel

Actress, Destiny Etiko, recently marked her birthday and she raised not a few eyebrows when she celebrated it with a brand new car. An excited Etiko, who had informed her fans that she built a house for her mother earlier in the year, showed off the new automobile on Instagram, and this drew criticisms from some Nigerians who wondered how she got the money to afford such a luxury.

However, in a chat with Sunday Scoop, Etiko revealed that the car was a gift. She said, “The car was actually given to me as a birthday gift. I work so hard and make my money, but for now, I cannot use my money to buy such a car. It was a gift from a loved one.”

On how she handled trolls who condemned her on social media, the actress who shot into prominence through the movie, Idemili, said, “Everybody cannot like you. When I built a house for my mother, people started saying all sorts of nonsense, questioning me about who gave me money to build the house.

“When I bought a Toyota Venza last year, people also asked who got me the car. Somebody works hard, another person sees her hard work and tries to support her, and I don’t know why that becomes a problem. Initially, I used to get angry over such comments, but now, I know better. If you are not being spoken about, it means you are not relevant. I am on my lane thinking of how to improve my life. Gone are those days I got scared when people called me names.”
