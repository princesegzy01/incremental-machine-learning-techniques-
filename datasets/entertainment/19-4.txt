I wasn’t affected by xenophobic attacks in South Africa – Mr Rise
Dayo Adeola

South African-based singer, Kene Obiakanwa, aka Mr Rise, has assured his fans and well-wishers that he is safe and wasn’t affected by the recent xenophobic attacks against Nigerians and other Africans in South Africa.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop during the week, the entertainer said, “With gratitude to God, I joyfully announce to my fans and well-wishers that I am safe and presently in Nigeria. I was not affected by the xenophobic attacks.”

The Anambra State-born artiste, who recently released his new single, Naughty, has been in Nigeria for some weeks promoting the song before the outbreak of the xenophobic attacks.

Recalling how he began his journey in the music industry, the Mass Communication graduate of Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Anambra State, said, “I started my music career about a decade ago as a rapper and a songwriter in Lagos, before relocating to South Africa. It has been quite challenging but also fulfilling, and I thank God that my music is becoming well accepted.”

On what inspired his new song, Mr Rise stated, “I just wanted to make a feel-good and groovy song that people could easily relate to, and that’s how Naughty came about. I decided to feature a Lagos-based young artiste, 9kins, because I fancy his style, and it was a wonderful collaboration.”

Managed by Solution Network Entertainment, the singer also hinted that he would be embarking on a club tour across the country soon.
