Planning comedy shows in Nigeria too expensive – Acapella
Olajide Samuel

Chinedu Daniel, better known as Acapella, has decried the high cost of organising a comedy show in Nigeria.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, he said, “Planning a comedy show in Nigeria is very expensive, compared to what obtains if one is hosting it outside the country. The Nigerian audience wants to see nearly half of an entire industry for a regular fee of N5,000. In some other countries, one can organise a show with just social media buzz. But in Nigeria, one would have to do billboards, as well as television and radio adverts, which cost a fortune. The cost of booking a particular venue on Victoria Island can almost be used to organise two good shows abroad.”

Sharing his view on cliques in the Nigerian comedy industry, Acapella said, “There are cliques everywhere and in everything. There will always be people one is comfortable working with, and vice versa. I am an extreme realist and I’m not going to deny that I’m not comfortable working with some particular set of people.”

Speaking on the inspiration behind his show, the comedian said, “My event was inspired by hunger. I also desired to stage a one-man show where I could express myself in full.”
