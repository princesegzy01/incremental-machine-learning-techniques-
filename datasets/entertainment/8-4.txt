Gospel singer, Dee Doris, has said that the teachings of the Senior Pastor of Believers’ Loveworld Inc, popularly known as Christ Embassy, Chris Oyahkilome, inspired her new song, In This Place.

Doris, who is a member of the church, described her latest song as beautiful, inspirational, uplifting and powerful.

She told Saturday Beats, “My new song was written and composed by me through the teachings of my pastor (Chris Oyahkilome). The project has been a very beautiful experience for me because I put a lot into it and we are all experiencing the reward today. For the video shot by Carel Film, it took us seven months to come out with an excellent result.”

On her relationship with Oyahkilome, the Delta State-born singer who is an ordained deaconess in the church, added, “I have been a member of Christ Embassy and the Loveworld Music and Arts ministry since 1993. I cannot talk about my success in music without mentioning my pastor’s name. He is also my mentor.”

She also attributed her career growth to everyone around her, including her husband and an evangelist, Kathy Woghiren.
