Highlife saxophonist and juju singer, Yinka Best, says he is still a force to reckon with as far as the Nigerian scene music is concerned. The musician, who held an album launch recently in Nigeria, is set for a public presentation of three new albums in the United Kingdom.

Speaking with Sunday Scoop, Best stated that the upcoming event was a follow-up to the successful album launch he had in Nigeria. According to him, unlike the erroneous impression being held by some mischief makers, his new works exemplify the fact that he is still very much on top of his game, especially as far as juju music is concerned. “I am still on top of my game as a juju artiste. It is therefore an aberration to think otherwise. And that is what I want to prove with the release of these three albums at the same time,” he said.

Renowned for his mastery and infusion of sax percussion into his brand of juju music, Best added, “Besides the album launch, the event is also being used to celebrate my birthday. I’ll, therefore, leverage on that to appreciate my fans in Manchester”.

Titled, The Great Legends, Lift Me Up and Dance of Joy, the launch of the three albums is billed to attract juju legends such as afro juju creator, Sir Shina Peters, and Lalale Friday singer, Wale Thompson.
