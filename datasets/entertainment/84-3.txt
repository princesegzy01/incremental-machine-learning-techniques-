After a seeming lull in the buoyant cinema scene in Nigeria, the jig is about to return with a much anticipated film, Zero Hour, a thriller from Robert Peters, the director of the celebrated 30 Days in Atlanta and A Trip To Jamaica.

Coming to cinemas across the country soon, Zero Hour, is a star-studded movie, starring the ageless Richard Mofe-Damijo, and returning old Nollywood flame, Eucharia Anunobi in a story of love, business and crime, with other screen delights such as Alexx Ekubo, Ali Nuhu, Rahama Sadau, Ayoola Ayolola, Halima Yusuf, and notable Cockcrow at Dawn actress, Ene Oloja, who is making her debut in a feature film.

A collaboration between Galaxy Transportation and Construction Services Limited, Native Media, Whitestone Pictures, and FKD Productions, the movie tells the story of an only child and heir apparent of a large company, who returns to take back his fatherâ€™s business empire. In the mix are his uncle and guardian, his cousin, and his love interest.

Supporting the award-winning Robert Peters in the production of the movie were Rogers Ofime, Samuel Jonathan, Mutairu Jimoh, Mayowa Labiran, Ronke Oshinjobi, Uzee Usman, Bamidele Akingbulu, and a host of others.
