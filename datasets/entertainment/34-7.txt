A Counselling and Educational Psychology graduate of the University of Abuja, Agbomere Osemobo, aka Priceless, has emerged the winner of this year’s House of Models Reality television show.

Osemobo, who competed with 20 contestants to win the grand prize of $3,000 and a brand new car, admitted that she was shocked when she was announced as the winner of the reality show.

She said, “It happened to be my first contest. I didn’t see this coming but I came and I conquered. I was the quietest person in the house. I was even given the name, ‘Mummy G. O’, because of my calmness but my votes actually counted and I won. I thank Almighty Lord for picking me among many.”

According to her, when she lost her job last year, she thought the world had come to an end. She stated, “I lost my job last year. Later, I stumbled on an advert on Instagram page. I thought I should give the contest a try and now the rest is history. I thank God that this platform has given me the opportunity to discover other talents in me. I’m not going to get stuck in one place as a model because I’ve found out that I can sing, act and engage in many sporting activities.”

Ezechukwu Stephanie emerged as the first runner up, Godwin Young was the second runner up, Musa Asekhame emerged as the third runner up while Nwokeke Juliet clinched the fourth runner up position.

The executive producers and directors of the show who are twin brothers, Emmanuel and Joseph Etim said the show was geared towards giving the Nigerian youth the opportunity to showcase their talents to the world.
