A United Kingdom-based disc jockey and music producer, Prince Thompson Iyamu, has said that many in his shoes are begging to show the world that they have other talents beyond being behind the turn-table or mixer.

Iyamu, who is fondly known as P Tee Money, recently released a new album titled ‘I won’t Stop’, and said that Nigerian DJs, both at home or in the Diaspora, were beginning to command the respect they deserved due to their foray into singing and producing the works of many musicians.

He explained that his new album was aimed at encouraging youths in Nigeria to see the world positively despite the challenges they might be facing in the country.

He said, “The fact is that DJs, especially those of us from Nigeria, are beginning to command the respect we deserve because we have shown the world that we have talents in many areas.

“My new album is to encourage people, especially the youth, in believing in themselves and making the best out of every situation.

“Young people must be inspired to look at the future with hope and belief because they are the owners of tomorrow.”

Apart from being a DJ, P Tee Money has also authored a number of books.
