Man’s eyeball cracks as flying champagne cork hits his face
Reality TV star, Theo Campbell, has been blinded by a flying champagne cork.

Campbell, of MTV’s The Challenge fame, was struck in the eyes and became blind in the right eye after what he described as a “really unfortunate accident” involving a champagne cork.

He shared the news on his verified Instagram page.

He revealed that despite undergoing two eye surgeries, he has “lost all vision in my right eye” because it was “split in half.”

“Who would have thought [that] a champagne cork would be the end of me!?” Campbell lamented on Instagram.

His girlfriend, Kaz Crossley, said the accident occurred when Campbell got champagne in his eye.

“He took his glasses off for a moment and at that point, a cork hit him directly in the eye.

“He was hospitalised and had seven stitches to close the eye,” Crossley narrated on her own Instagram handle.

“This will make people aware of the dangers related to opening champagne bottles around other people and be more careful,” she counselled.
