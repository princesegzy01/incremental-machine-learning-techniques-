Olajide Samuel

Broadcaster and actor, Onoge ‘Tega’ Ben, aka OTB, is set to hit the stage with his first musical stage play titled, ‘OTB: Warri to Lagos— The Musical!’ The play which features other comedians including AY, Akpororo, Kenny Blaq, Ushbebe, Dan The Humorous, Senator, and a host of others, attempts to narrate the success story of the host.

According to OTB, the play will explore the challenges faced by the average Nigerian youth who believes in the ‘Lagos dream’. With the use of dramatic elements such as suspense, comic relief and a heavy dose of musical explorations, the play aims to inspire the average Nigerian youth regardless of his or her discipline.

On what attendees can expect from the show, the entertainer told Saturday Beats, “I wasn’t just born in Warri (Delta State), I am a thespian with an uncommon knack for storytelling and acting. ‘Warri to Lagos— The Musical!’ is a fusion of my exceptional passion for music and comedy, telling the Nigerian story from the eyes of a Warri boy.

Powered by Adron Homes, the play would be staged twice on October 13, 2019, at the Muson Centre, Lagos.
