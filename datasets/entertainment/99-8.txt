Riding in tricycle doesn’t mean I’m broke – Dele Abiodun

When veteran singer, Admiral Dele Abiodun, was spotted on a commercial tricycle, commonly called Keke NAPEP, in Ogba, Lagos, recently, it raised concerns that he had fallen on hard times. In his hey days, the 70-year-old juju singer ruled the streets of Yoruba-speaking states.

Speaking with Sunday Scoop, Abiodun maintained that he was not broke. He stated, “I still make money from music. People come to me for shows and I don’t work for free. It is funny for people to think one is broke because one is riding on a Keke NAPEP. I have two cars in my house – a Sienna and a Range Rover.”

He said he visited the Excellence Hotel in Ogba, Lagos, in a Keke NAPEP, because his house was close to the place and it was too late for him to drive. He added, “I am a Nigerian too. What is wrong with people riding in Keke NAPEP? I was not the driver; I was a passenger. If I decide to take a Keke NAPEP, it shouldn’t be seen as anything serious because the other passengers are not animals.”

Abiodun lamented that the mentality of many Nigerians was shallow. “Indian billionaires ride in Keke NAPEP for short trips. If I want to go to the bank on my street, I don’t need to drive there. I am too old to start showing off and I have seen it all,” the veteran musician stated.

According to him, if one has a car, it is by the grace of God. He insisted that there were many people without cars in Nigeria and they had not died. “Riding in a Keke NAPEP makes me a complete Nigerian. I still attend shows every weekend. This weekend, I have a show in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State. Despite my age, I still dance well on stage; I am still very fit,” Abiodun stated.
