It is not news that popular actress, Dayo Amusa, is also a singer.

However, in a chat with Sunday Scoop, Amusa said she was yet to make money from music despite investing heavily in it. She stated, “I know I have invested a lot of funds in recording songs, shooting videos and promoting them, but the returns have not been encouraging.”

She stated that inasmuch as she was in love with music, she didn’t consider herself a performing artiste. She said, “Although I have performed for a few friends, I am not a performing artiste. I have never been paid to perform at an event.”

The actress explained that she recorded her new song, Mosorire, to appreciate God for all He had done in her life. “When I was writing the song, I didn’t have anything in mind; I just wanted to thank God. I believe that whatever is worth doing is worth doing well. I take my time to do music because I make meaningful songs. Also, you know I do movies as well and I believe in focusing on one project at a time. Those times I wasn’t doing movies, I was focused on other things,” she added.
