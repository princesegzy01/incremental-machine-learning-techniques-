How social media followers of el-Rufai, wife Hadiza misinterpreted their sarcastic tweets
A tweet by Mrs. Hadiza Isma El-Rufai, and a response by her husband, Kaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai, have become a ‘learning curve’ for their social media followers and some bloggers.

Trouble started when Hadiza tweeted about her experience at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and some of her followers and blogspots took what was supposed to be a sarcasm literally.

She had tweeted:

This time last week, I was standing in the queue at JFK, New York checking in for my flight back to Nigeria. Can you imagine? A whole ‘Excellency’ fa. I wanted to scream: Do you know who I am? Next time, I’ll travel with my orderly …. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 — Hadiza Isma El-Rufai (@hadizel) October 24, 2019

Her governor-husband didn’t help issues when he responded:

My Oga……”Excellency” na temporary title along with an equally temporary job o! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/6XDKYwvj8u — Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai (@elrufai) October 24, 2019

Many people who came across the couple’s tweets misinterpreted Hadiza’s tweet as a complaint and her husband’s response as a counsel for her not to be carried away with temporary privilege of public office.

A handful of her social media followers, however, got the drift and had fun dissecting other people’s misinterpretation.

Anyone who follows Hadiza’s Twitter handle @hadizel would attest to her great sense of humour, which many people missed in the contentious tweet.

She has since tweeted her explanation of the tweet:

Hey, Twitter peeps, Someone posted my husband’s response to my last tweet on Instablog9ja. It’s a pity that many Nigerians don’t get sarcasm. Twitter people are smarter, sha.

Please check out the comments on Instablog9ja for laughs. — Hadiza Isma El-Rufai (@hadizel) October 24, 2019

Not done, the Kaduna First Lady says:

I’ll be placing a caveat before any satirical postings henceforth. I want to use letters like they do with films e.g. PG: Parental Guidance. So far, I’ve thought of only two: IWP: Instabloggers Waka Pass
