I’m not ashamed Adekunle Gold gave me a song – Olawale
Olushola Ricketts

Adekunle Gold has come to the rescue of the 2013 winner of Project Fame, Olawale Ojo, after it was reported that he had become an Uber driver.

Ojo has now released a new song, One Day, written and sponsored by Adekunle Gold.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, Ojo said he didn’t feel ashamed that he was given a song. He stated, “Even the greatest musicians have had hit songs written by other people. People need to find out the writers of their favourite songs; it might not be the singers. Music is a collaborative process.”

The ex-Project Fame winner also said though he was not signed to Adekunle Gold’s record label, the Orente singer would continue to be a great source of support and inspiration to his art and life. He stated, “I’m very grateful to Adekunle Gold and his team for their kind gesture. I had once met him in 2015. Reaching out to me after he heard my story shows the type of man he is.

“Working with him was incredible. I spent time in the studio with Adekunle and I can say that the experience will improve my music.”

Olawale also said he had been receiving overwhelming support since he released his new single. He stated, “I have been receiving messages from people from all walks of life, including artistes I look up to. The most heartwarming has been messages from Nigerians who are also struggling. People are inspired by the lyrics of the song, believing that one day, they will achieve all their dreams.”
