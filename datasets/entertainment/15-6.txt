Teni, Ikedieze, others to star in Dear Affy
A group of talented artistes are set to appear in a new movie entitled, Dear Affy, courtesy of Samuel Olatunji’s 007 Global Productions.

The movie will see singer Teni Da Entertainer and Big Brother Naija housemate, Sir Dee, make their debut in a Nollywood production for the first time.

Dear Affy is a joint production between 007 Global Productions and Aul Media Studios, Track and Dolly Productions, as well as Dr Tola Elatuyi and others.

The movie tells the fascinating story of a female art enthusiast, who is about to marry the man of her dreams but suffers a serious setback when she ‘accidentally’ becomes pregnant. She embarks on a challenging mission to locate the father of the unborn baby, having chosen to steer clear of sex during courtship.

The cast of the movie includes top Nollywood stars and celebrities, such as Charles Inojie, Toyin Abraham, Odunlade Adekola and Chiwetalu Agu, to mention a few.

Dear Affy will be directed by Samuel Olatunji, who has also produced The Ghost and The Tout’ and ‘Seven and A Half Dates.

Describing the movie as an ambitious project, Olatunji said, “We want to tell a different kind of Nollywood story. We want to be very professional and excellent in what we are our doing. We want to provide 100 per cent entertainment and we are not going to stop there because we have big dreams. We believe that Nigeria is a place where such dreams are possible.”

Dear Affy will be released in cinemas across the country as from February 14, 2020.
