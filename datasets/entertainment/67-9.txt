Voice trainer, Adeboye Adefolalu, popularly known as Uncle Ade, has said Nigerian artistes need to train their voices properly. He stated, “I have spent some time observing some of the more successful Nigerian afrobeats artistes, and generally, their vocal abilities are good on record. However, having seen several of these artistes perform live, I am of the opinion that they might not yet have the experience to perform live. I believe there is a real lack of resources available to educate Nigeria singers on how their voices work, and what they need to do to develop their voices.”

Emphasising on the importance of voice training to an artiste’s career, Uncle Ade said, “If a singer is just starting out, and doesn’t have much natural talent, chances are that such artiste would be more dependent on a tutor to help advise, analyse, and guide their vocal development. This will take months or even years to get to the level of a voice that touches souls. Meanwhile, if such artistes decide not to take lessons, they will significantly decrease their chances of reaching the desired heights where they can really make impact.”

Uncle Ade has worked with artistes such as Seyi Shay, Kele Le Roc, Isaiah Dyer, Sha-Sha, Angel Williams, Allyson Browne, among others.
