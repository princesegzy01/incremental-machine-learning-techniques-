Niniola Apata says she is proud of the growth of her younger sister, Teni, in the music industry.

In an encounter with Sunday Scoop, Niniola stated, “Teni is my baby sister and her success makes me proud. That is my baby doing good and I am very happy for her. That is how a big sister should feel. As a big sister, we talk every day as opposed to what some people think. Apart from music, we are blood sisters.”

While she didn’t totally rule out a collaboration with Teni, Niniola wasn’t clear about it either. She urged people to stay vigilant, stating that anything could come up between them.

Speaking on her plans for this year, Niniola said she had already started it on a good note, saying, “I have released my first single of 2019, titled Designer, and it is doing well. I plan to release its video very soon.”
