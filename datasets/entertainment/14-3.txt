Andy Boyo, known for his top-notch movies, including Untamed, Spirit of Assassins, and House of Talent is at it again.

The respected producer cum director, recently held the movie premiere for his latest flick, Fugitive in Lagos, to further boost his contributions to Nollywood.

The movie features tested and trusted actors such as Keppy Ekpenyong-Bassey, Daniel K. Daniel, Blossom Chukwujekwu, Kate Henshaw; Rwandan sensation, Denise Gakire, and a host of others.

Speaking on the concept of the movie, Boyo said, “Most of the messages presented in the movie are subtle. It preaches against xenophobia and encourages the union of African countries. It also deals with a subtle rejection of legal processes. In the movie, we have stars from Rwanda, Zambia, and Uganda. It is entertaining and filled with a lot of suspense. It is not a typical Nigerian movie that people expect. In the story, there is a mystery man who is the boss of a syndicate that no one knows about.”

On how he got inspired to make the movie, the veteran filmmaker said, “The inspiration (for the movie) came from observing happenings around. I actually shot it about a year ago. The movie is set in a fictional United States of Africa where every country in Africa makes up just one country.”
