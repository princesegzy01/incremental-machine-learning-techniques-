Keshinro Ololade, aka Lil Kesh, has replied critics who think his music career is taking a nosedive.

The singer, in a chat with Sunday Scoop, stated that he didn’t plan to do many things as a musician last year. He said, “I didn’t hold a solo concert last year because I feel there is time for everything. To be honest, I didn’t have a lot of plans for last year. It wasn’t like I planned to do many things and couldn’t achieve them. I didn’t intend to have many concerts or shoot a lot of musical videos.”

According to him, he was able to achieve the few things he set out to do, and that made him happy. He said, “Last year, I wasn’t just a musician. I was also a businessman and I tried to put a lot of things in place. Although my energy was divided, I was happy that I was able to do other things apart from music.”

Kesh also said he knew from the outset that the song, Able God, by Chinko Ekun, on which he was featured, would be a hit. He said, “The moment I heard the song, I knew it was a very good one that would be widely accepted because people love songs that give them hope. I am not sure everyone (involved in the recording) knew it would be this big though. We had the song with us for more than a month before releasing it.”

On his plans for 2019, he stated that he would be working more outside the country. “I will start my tour soon and I will be in Europe for a month. After that, I still have plans for more tours. I also intend to drop a body of work this year but it all depends on my fans’ demands,” he said.
