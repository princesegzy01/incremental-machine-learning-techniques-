Olajide Samuel

Actress and adult entertainment consultant, Seyi Hunter, has said Nigerians need to be more supportive of porn stars. Hunter, who recently launched her own porn website, said the demand by the viewers of her vlog, made her start making porn.

She told Sunday Scoop, “I got into adult entertainment two years ago. I started with my sex vlog, ‘SinfulFriday’ where I taught people how to make love the right way and enjoy it. To widen our tentacles, we started organising orgy and swinger parties. We host every kind of adult parties you can think of, even bachelor’s eve. I started making porn movies when our viewers started asking for practical videos of what I teach.”

Insisting that acting porn was just like every other profession, hunter said, “Nigerians need to be more open-minded when it comes to dealing with porn stars. The women involved have decided to take this as a career, for the same reason you are doing what you do. People should support them. It’s one of the reasons I created this job opportunity for them. We don’t want people to start stealing, or go into fraudulent activities. Let’s support one another— no job is demeaning. Men really have to get it right and understand that it’s a movie first before anything else.”
