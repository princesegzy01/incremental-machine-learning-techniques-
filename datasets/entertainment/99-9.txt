My break from Nigerian music scene ill-advised – Sean Dampte
Olushola Ricketts

United Kingdom-based Nigerian singer, Oluyole Oluwaseun, aka Sean Dampte, has explained why he has been quiet on the Nigerian music scene since releasing a hit single, Wine your Tinkolo, on which he featured YQ.

Dampte told Sunday Scoop that he took an ill-advised break from the Nigerian music scene. He said, “I wouldn’t agree that I have been silent. But yes, I took an ill-advised break from the Nigerian music industry and concentrated on other markets to give me a global appeal. I have worked with producers such as Goldhands, Delirious, Jay Ocean, Jomane and Joey Benks in the UK, Jamaica and the United States.

According to him, he doesn’t have any problem making an impact on the Nigerian music scene again. He stated, “Kings are always welcome to sit on their throne. Nigerians love a great comeback story; we love the underdogs winning. I don’t joke with my fans both at home and abroad; I love them all. My song, No be Joke, off my debut EP, The Awoodah Begins, recently climbed up to become one of the top five songs on iTunes Nigerian charts during the week. The song was produced by Joey Banks and mastered by DXL Da Beat.”
