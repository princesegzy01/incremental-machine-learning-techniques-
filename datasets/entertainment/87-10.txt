Top actress, Kate Henshaw, has shown her understanding of the political terrain in an upcoming movie, 4th Republic.

Playing the role of a governorship candidate in the new political thriller, the actress stars alongside Bimbo Manuel, Sani Muazu, Enyinna Nwigwe, Linda Ejiofor and Yakubu Mohammed.

Speaking about the movie, Henshaw said, “4th Republic is not just a film right for the election period. The most significant part is the message it carries as we need to stand up for the truth and fight for justice. It’s our duty.”

Directed by Ishaya Bako, the movie tells the story of a governorship aspirant, Mabel King (Henshaw), who challenges the victory of the incumbent, Idris Sani (Sani Mu’azu).

4th Republic is written by Emil B. Garuba and Zainab Omaki, while it is produced by Griot Studios Limited and Amateur Heads Productions.

Set for release in April, 4th Republic was funded by grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Open Society Initiative for West Africa.
