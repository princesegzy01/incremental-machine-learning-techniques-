It’s a ‘Nigerian thing’ not to honour veterans – Azadus
Olajide Samuel

Singer, Olalekan Fadeyi, popularly known as Azadus, rocked the Nigerian entertainment scene in the early 2000s. Till date, whenever his hit song, You is the One, is played, fans sing along with gusto. But the singer is not happy that forerunners in the entertainment industry aren’t often recognised by succeeding generations.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, the singer opined that it was a ‘Nigerian thing’ not to honour veterans. He said, “It’s a Nigerian thing (not to accord respect to veterans). Imagine a certain dude who tried to undermine Professor Wole Soyinka’s achievements recently as if they are only worth a few currencies from his wallet. I beg to reserve my comment because I don’t want to get angry”

Shedding light on what he had been up to music-wise, Azadus said, “I have been involved in a lot of activities in the entertainment industry. I recently worked on a mobile app, but I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag yet. Also, I released an album two years ago. Although the awareness wasn’t as grand as I wished, it still got a good number of plaudits. Right now, I am working on an album that features a number of industry heavyweights.”

The Madam singer also said though he didn’t know of any artiste that encouraged fraudulent acts, such persons needed to be cautioned if they were noticed doing that. He added, “Sincerely, I have not seen one and if we have such artistes, they should be advised.”
