American-born Nigerian artiste, actor and filmmaker, Anthony Otaigbe, popularly known as TheMindofAY, has refuted rumours making the rounds that he didn’t merit his nomination for the All African Music Awards last year.

TheMindofAy said his nomination was as a result of the hard work he put into his craft. He said, “My hard work and consistency fetched me the Afrima nomination. I try as much as possible to be better in every project I do. I think Afrima saw what I was doing and they thought I was worthy of the nomination.”

The chartered accountant, who worked with a private organisation and the Federal Government of Nigeria before deciding to focus on his career, said his accounting background was mainly to finance his artistic ambitions.

He added, “My passion for the arts has always held an equal amount of importance to me as my professional career. My accounting background is mainly for financing my artistic ambitions.”

On what drives him as an entertainer, TheMindofAy said, “I wanted to create a tool that would outlive me and continue my mission after I’ve left this earth. Also, I use my parents as voice actors; so, in a way, I feel like I’ve immortalised them, and that makes me happy too. I grew up in a country that reduced my cultural history to one chapter in a history book. So, in each walk of life I find myself in, whether it is artistic or humanitarian, I seek to correct this by providing a cultural repository for future generations of Nigerians to drink from.”

Currently promoting his new single titled, Ehimen, the singer said it was “a strong follow-up to his 2018 hit track, Sasa.
