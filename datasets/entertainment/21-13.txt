Actresses are not expensive to maintain — Kisa Gbekle
Olajide Samuel

When you think of Ghanaian actress, Kisa Gbekle, what comes to mind is a role interpreter who expresses herself without inhibitions. Known to always sport designer wears and post pictures of herself in fancy places, many believe that it would cost an arm and a leg to ‘maintain’ her.

However, in an encounter with Sunday Scoop, Gbekle who has featured in a number of Nollywood movies, insisted that actresses were not expensive to maintain as both wives and girlfriends. “Being expensive to maintain is about one’s mindset. A random girl who is not even an actress can be expensive to maintain, depending on the position she puts herself. There are also actresses who cannot even afford a car or pay their rent. Actresses are not expensive to maintain, it is their preferences that matter,” she said.

The actress, who was once romantically linked with Ghanaian singer, Shatta Wale, also said it was important for women to be confident.

She added, “Confidence makes a woman beautiful. Being confident in your skin makes you beautiful as a woman.”

Asked if acting paid her bills, she answered, “Acting doesn’t pay my bills. Acting only pays the bills for the likes of Genevieve Nnaji, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, Jackie Appiah and some others.”
