Actress marries self to celebrate 40th birthday
American actress, Busy Philipps, celebrated her 40th birthday by hosting a lavish Mexican destination wedding to marry herself.

Philipps took to her Instagram handle @busyphilipps to share the concept behind the bash, where she posted a photo of herself in a stunning dress.

“So I was thinking about turning 40. And it is weird because my perpetual age is 19. Sometimes 27 depending but now I’m 40 (my birthday is the 25th actually) HOW AM I 40 YEARS OLD?

“Anyway, I decided I wanted to throw myself a destination wedding (to myself) for my 40th at one of my favourite places in the world @florafarms in Cabo.”
