Gospel artistes, Tope Alabi, Sola Allyson, Imoleayo Adebayo, Samson Adekanmbi (Sammy P), Adelakun Ayewa, Michael Harjovy, gospel rap sensation Engo, Tunde Ara, Kayefi, and Laolu Gbenjo, among others, are set to perform at the fourth edition of the Luli concert.

The concert, organised by El-Berachah Worship Ministry, holds next weekend at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Onikan, Lagos.

The Chairman of the Luli concert 2019 organising committee, Gbenga Obajuwon-Ogunlana, said the concert would create a medium to promote God’s word, worship and intercede via praises for the nation. He stated, “The theme of the concert, ‘Power in His Praise’, is a testimony on applying the instrumentality of praise as a weapon for victory. Despite the challenges we face daily as a nation, we still have more than enough reasons to be thankful. It is, therefore, important that we raise the volume of our praise and worship.”

Obajuwon-Ogunlana listed the activities lined up to mark this year’s concert to include, a music masterclass and a two-day medical check-up.

A community walk was also held on Saturday to promote physical and mental wellbeing. The four-kilometre walk kicked off at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos Island.
