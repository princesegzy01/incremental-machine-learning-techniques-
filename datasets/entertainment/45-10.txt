Musician and producer, Prince Bayo, has said his passion for music is the major drive behind his career. In a chat with Saturday Beats, the entertainer revealed that his parents once advised him to choose another career path instead of music. He said, according to them, his dream of being a musician was unrealistic.

“I started dancing and singing to Michael Jackson when I was five years old; he was one of my major inspirations into the world of music.

“My music is a cross between pop and lovers rock reggae; however, I recently integrated Afrobeats into my style.

“When I started my career, my parents thought I was being unrealistic and thought I should toe another career path; they started taking me seriously when I started making progress. I’m doing music because I am very passionate about it. As a child, I was not interested in the mainstream education system because I knew I would be a known singer one day.

“The challenges I faced have come from mainly haters being jealous of my progress and managers ripping me off as they end up not sticking to the plans or agreement,” he said.
