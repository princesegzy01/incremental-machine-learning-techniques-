Money we make in movies doesn’t match the effort­ – Uche Elendu

According to actress, Uche Elendu, the movie industry does not always reward labour properly. She stated that what actors and producers made from movies was not commensurate with the effort they put in. She said, “The last production I did was a Christian movie and most religious films are not widely accepted. I actually did that movie to pass a message. I will not say that I made the kind of money I expected, but at the end of the day, I also did not lose money.

“The industry is no longer as it used to be; we don’t make as much money as before. The major challenge I face in my career is when I have to leave my family to go on set, and at the end of the day, I don’t make enough money to compensate for the time spent. I’m in this industry majorly because of the passion and not the money. We also work under very stringent conditions because we have to do so much in little time. However, despite all these challenges, I have never thought of quitting the industry. Besides, this is not where I make most of my money from. Rather, I make money from other businesses and invest it in the industry.”

Speaking on what she’s working on at the moment, Elendu stated, “I am working on my first production for the year and I’m also concentrating on my business because I’m an entrepreneur. There are a lot of things in the pipeline. I intend to achieve a lot this year.”
