Celebs don’t like to admit they don’t have – Basorge Tariah

Ace actor, Basorge Tariah, is not happy with some of the happenings in the music industry at the moment, especially as it concerns the welfare of entertainers. The thespian said he had made some suggestions that could turn around the fortunes of his colleagues but they were not adhered to. He stated, “Some years ago, I advocated that we should set up things like cooperatives and have land investments, retirement plans and other things; and I think some actors have been able to key into it. Unfortunately, it is hard to get as little as 30 actors to agree on something. By now, we would have been big property owners in some of the highbrow areas of Lagos if only more people had bought into it. One of the things hampering the growth of the industry is ego. A lot of people have chips on their shoulders. Celebrities sometimes don’t want to admit that they don’t have.

“We have billionaires who enjoy actors and open their homes and arms to them; when you have such relationships, you should implore the billionaire to set up some sort of financial plan that will sustain you for a long time.”

The actor also explained that he was never pressured to live in a certain way to please the public. “I am a content human being and I live a simple life. Nobody is going to influence me to live in a particular way. I would board public transport if I need to without caring what anybody has to say about it. If you know you smoke and have other excesses, quit them and exercise some restraint,” he said.
