BBNaija: Shehu Sani, followers in Twitter war as he tips Mercy to win
Social media followers of Senator Shehu Sani have taken him to task as he tips Mercy Eke to win the ongoing BBNaija Season 4.

Sani, who represented Kaduna Central at the Eighth Senate, had tweeted:

When our Khafi left we settled for Tacha and now Tacha left,we are settling for Merci,hoping some of us will not be accused of mobile loyalty. — Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) September 29, 2019

But his social media fans see things differently. See their responses:

Fmr Senator Shehu Sani don’t get it twisted not everybody settled for this chics you metioned Omashola and Seyi were the men we were looking out for not those Chics and am really surprised that you do hv time for #bbnaija Mr Senator!! — Fatai Amada (@Fatai_Amada) September 29, 2019

We will not!!! We will not participate! She held an iron to hit Tacha she was supposed to be disqualified! Messy broke the rules and because of a plastic bum was exempted We will not partake in a biased and prejudice show. Big Fraudster! #EverythingTacha #ReleaseTacha #BBTacha — TACHA’s TITAN NA DEM till Day99 (@sage81928045) September 29, 2019

Sir it’s better to root for Seyi or Mike than rooting for Mercy. — 🔱Annclaret Nma🔱 (@realannclaret) September 29, 2019

…but mercy made Tacha leaves, any logic sir @ShehuSani ?? — AMR®©™ 🔰🔰✳️ (@malikmuhammad88) September 29, 2019

I am surprised sir at ur choice in a show that is a microcosm of Nigeria. Should honour, positivity, fairness and responsibility no longer be celebrated by us? Mike Edwards is there as the embodiment of all the above and u overlooked him? Wow. Do the right thing sir #BBnaija — SupermanMike (@SupermanMike3) September 29, 2019

sir seyi is a leader. mercy is not. also, our youth needs seyi as a good example to look up to. seyi is brilliant and cool headed. seyi was like an elder brother to tacha. I hope I have been able to convince you — Saint kenny (@jboy111111) September 29, 2019

sir settle for seyi. mercy is not better either — Saint kenny (@jboy111111) September 29, 2019

Others are taken aback by the tweet:

Baba self dey watch bbn — Afolabi OnlyGodknows (@A_OnlyGodknows) September 29, 2019

Evidently,he needs a job. @elrufai should pls temper mercy on him and engage him even if it’s a class room teacher. Bikonu. 🙏 — JAHEIM😎❓ (@Jaheim007) September 29, 2019

To whom he replied:

My Brother in Nija nowadays 65 is youth. — Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) September 29, 2019

Someone thinks the tweet has deeper meaning:

There are more to this tweet than what it’s literally saying. — Emmanuel (@DignifiedEmma) September 29, 2019

Sani agrees:

Not everyone is blessed with the wisdom to decipher parables. — Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) September 29, 2019
