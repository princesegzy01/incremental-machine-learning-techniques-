After hosting The African Film Festival for three years, US-based filmmaker, Kelechi Eke, has recorded another milestone with the launch of Rootflix, a streaming and distribution platform for festival-qualified films.

Speaking about the platform, Eke said, “The vision is not only to host culturally-rich motion pictures that come through festivals, but also, a platform where filmmakers can look back and appreciate their humble beginnings in filmmaking-their roots.

“Over the years, I have got many questions from filmmakers who couldn’t attend TAFF about where they could see the movies that were screened at the festival. I initially didn’t have an answer.

“But when I thought about it, I realised that many quality films that go through festivals end up without distribution. Thus, I was motivated to create a platform for such films. Being a software engineer and knowing the distribution challenge that we face, I felt I would have failed my colleagues if I did not do my part in finding a solution to the problem.”
