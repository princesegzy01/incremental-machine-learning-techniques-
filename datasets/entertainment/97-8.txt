Why I can’t marry two wives – Tony Tetuila
One-time hit-maker, Tony Tetuila, has pledged not to marry more than one wife because of the experience he had as a child.

In a chat with Sunday Scoop, Tetuila said, “Due to my experience while growing up, I can’t marry two wives or have a baby mama. If one is not careful with women, one will run into trouble. Marrying two wives means trouble. Although men cannot do without them, women are hard to manage. The moment you sleep with a woman, you’ve lost your respect too.

“I grew up in a polygamous home and the fact that I am alive today is by the grace of God. I was poisoned while I was little and I developed complications in my legs afterwards.”

Tetuila’s 16-year-marriage is blessed with three kids – two boys and a girl. “I see all my children venturing into entertainment because there are strong signs already. I have a good dancer in my house and a lovely vocalist,” he said.
