In a modern world where indigenous African cultures, traditional beliefs, and practices are gradually becoming extinct, Nollywood actor and producer, Bayo Alawiye, is still of the belief that African traditions are a part and parcel of our existence as Africans.

According to him, it was this belief that led to the making of his new movie, The King’s Cross.

Speaking about the message of the movie, Alawiye stressed the reason why African traditional beliefs must be preserved.

“Traditional African beliefs cannot be thrown into the gutters because they lack ‘scientific merit’ or ‘plausible reasoning’. These beliefs are part of the people. It is part of their day-to-day life.

“It is like asking Christians not to believe in Jesus and resurrection. That is preposterous, I hear you say, but that is the same way a believer of African norms and tradition will feel if you tell them that the notion of reincarnation or Ogbanje is false. Tell me what science says about God. The belief system of a group of people is their essence. Once that is lost, the people are lost,” he said.

The King’s Cross has a stellar cast that includes Alawiye, Omowunmi Dada, Dele Odule, Monica Friday, Funke Kate Adepegba, Gbenga Richards and Joseph Jaiyeoba.
