NFC to host first Berlin/Lagos Archival Film Festival
Mr Brian Etuk, Head of Public Relations and Intergovernmental Affairs, Nigerian Film Corporation, says the organisation is set to host the first Berlin and Lagos Archival Film Festival, ‘Decasia’.

Etuk said in a statement issued on Monday in Jos that the festival would feature the daily screening of films who had deployed the unique power of archival footage.

“The objective of the festival with the theme: ‘Reclaiming History Unveiling Memory’ is to sustain the global conversation on the impact of digital technologies as well as the relationship between archives and festivals.

“The festival which will run from October 24 to October 27, will take place at the NFC Lagos office/cinema complex of the Corporation, ” he said.

The statement quoted Dr Chidia Maduekwe, the NFC’s Managing Director, as saying that Nigeria was in dire need of an archival policy due to its rich cultural heritage and developmental history which should be secured and documented.

He said in spite of the volume of films produced in the country, several of those films had either been lost or destroyed, adding that a National Film Policy would address these anomalies, among others.
