Favoured Zone Entertainment has announced the release of a new single titled, ‘Chocolate’ by one of its signees, a 10-year-old singer, named Awal Abbas.

The song was produced by Young John, while the video was directed by TG Omori.

The Ogbomoso (Oyo State)-born young artiste, also called Mustar Sid by his fans, was discovered while doing his numerous freestyle rap videos, which have gained him both local and international attention.

According to Abass, the title of the song was inspired by his interest in chocolate when he was younger.

The singer told Saturday Beats, “My parents and other family members used to give me chocolates and other goodies as a form of reward mostly for being obedient and hard-working at home. That’s why I want to use my talent to encourage others kids to always be obedient and helpful, so they can achieve their dreams in life. I see myself as the next Jay-Z of Africa with a commitment to be a better version of myself at all times.”
