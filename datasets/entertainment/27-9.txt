Olajide Samuel

Famuagun Timilehin, better known as Ceeboi, has released a new single titled, ‘Super Woman.’

Produced by KrizBeatz, Ceeboi says the song reflects an exciting side of his artistry and it will win the heart of lovers of African music in Nigeria. He stated, “My new song, ‘Super Woman,’ is an African music treat, which embodies infectious harmonies and rhythm. The lyrics are relatable to Nigerians who love pop music. The theme of the song – celebrating the fine qualities of an African woman – is another elemental part, which gives essence to the sound. Mr C shot the video.”

A few months ago, the singer released his introductory EP, ‘protégé’, on which he featured artistes such as Sean Tizzle, Yung6ix, Rayvanny, Dremo and Spyro.
