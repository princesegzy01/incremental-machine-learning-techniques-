I’m only on Instagram because of my career, says Amanda Ebeye

Unlike most Nigerian celebrities, actress, Amanda Ebeye, says she is not crazy about social media.

Ebeye, in an encounter with Sunday Scoop, said she would have deleted her Instagram account if she weren’t an actress. She said, “If I were not an actress, I will not be on Instagram because I am a private person. But for the job I do, I have to be on social media. Also, you cannot see me posting about my relationship on social media and that doesn’t mean I am not in a relationship.”

She also explained that it had not been easy shuttling between Nigeria and Canada. But according to her, she has no choice but to continue the intercontinental shuttle because her son stays in Canada and she comes to Nigeria to work.

Ebeye confessed that she was not close to finding fulfilment in acting, insisting that she felt there was so much she could still offer the industry. She stated, “As a director, I have so much in my head that I like to create. Also, what stops me from featuring in a movie such as Black Panther?

“However, the industry is now very different from what it was in the past. We used to have one industry but we now have multiple industries in one Nollywood. We now have old Nollywood, new Nollywood, Asaba Nollywood, among others. It was easier for actors who came at the time the industry wasn’t saturated to dominate.”

The actress said she had decided to shun certain jobs that would not add value to her career. “If I am called for a job now, I will not take it unless the script is good. For me, before money, I consider if the script is good enough or not,” she stressed.
