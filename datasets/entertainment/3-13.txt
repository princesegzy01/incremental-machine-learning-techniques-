Singer and guitarist, Olufolafunmi Abiodun, aka Olufola, has said that if had to choose between food and access to a recording studio, he would go for the latter. Speaking about his passion for music in a chat with Sunday Scoop, he said, “I am happy when making music. Nothing compares to the feeling I get whenever I am in the studio. On several occasions, I have gone without food in the course of making music. Though food is a basic necessity of life, I would rather make music than eat.”

The entertainer who recently released a new song, My Beat, recalled how he started his career. “I started making music officially as a guitarist at 17 and it has been an interesting experience thus far. I am here for the long haul and I believe there are still many things I would do in the industry. I believe I have what it takes to be one of the biggest artistes in this country, nay Africa. I know that with time, my dreams will come to pass,” he said.
