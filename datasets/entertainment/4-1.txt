Gospel singer, Tope Van-Lare, popularly known as Tope Calculator, has urged gospel artistes across the country to stay true to their calling and deliver impactful songs with clear messages.

Speaking during the public launch of her new song and video titled, Odironyedikagi featuring Emapraise and Assumpta, Van-Lare said, “Gospel artistes should not give up their calling despite the present economic situation of the country. Today, there is a lot of compromise in the industry in a bid to get money. I know money is good but rather than chasing and focusing on money, let’s look towards delivering songs with quality messages to touch lives because, one might gain fame and make millions but after that, what else? I advise gospel artistes to stay focused and win souls for God.”

On what inspired the new song, the composer, singer, ballet instructor and medical lab scientist said, “Odironyedikagi is a product of inspiration I got while working in the laboratory. The song is basically for worship and a reflection of the incredible and indescribable nature of God. It speaks about the endless power of God and how our lives revolve around Him.”

Tope Calculator who is also the founder and CEO of New Dimension of Dance Concept, has four albums to her name– Wonderful Jesus, Love God, Calculator and Request.
