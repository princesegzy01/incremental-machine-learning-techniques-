I’ve more important things than talking on nude video controversy –Etinosa
Tofarati Ige

Controversial actress, Etinosa, has been in the news a lot recently. Unfortunately, it has mostly been for the wrong reasons. Largely unknown, the actress gained notoriety after she appeared nude on singer, MC Galaxy’s Instagram live video a few months ago. Shortly after the fiasco, she claimed that she was drunk and depressed when she acted that way.

However, during the week, her ‘accomplice’, MC Galaxy, alleged that the incident was planned after all. Refuting Galaxy’s claim, Etinosa wrote on her Instagram page, “Stop lying to Nigerians. They are not stupid. It hurts me a lot and you can tell by the harsh stupid way I cursed an innocent child because his father won’t stop throwing it at my face. However, after that happened, I tried talking to a real therapist and it really works – I have made significant progress…I have said my truth. I was caught at (sic) an unguarded moment; someone I called my friend recorded me and sent it to blogs. I take full responsibility and I’m trying to move on. I advise all parties involved including the nude video viewers to move on.”

Hoping to get more clarification, Sunday Scoop put a call across to the actress but she said tersely, “I put it out there and I made it clear that was the last I would mention (anybody’s name) or say (anything) about that issue. I don’t want to give any undue attention to this as I have more important things to do. I am very busy and I don’t have time for this kind of thing.”
