The Interswitch One Africa Music Fest has announced a partnership with Air Peace for the latter to become the 2019 official airline sponsor for the event.

The multi-faceted partnership between the two organisations was solidified last week in Lagos. The partnership will ‘highlight the shared commitment of philanthropy, tourism and global awareness showcasing all that Africa has to offer,’ a statement read.

Commenting on the partnership, the Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, said, “Africa is made up of a vibrant populace and we are extremely proud of the rebirth that has been witnessed, notably in the entertainment sector, particularly with our music and fashion, which has garnered international acclaim in recent years. This partnership was forged by the growing influence of One Africa Global, and Air Peace’s commitment to becoming the largest and most profitable airline company providing safe, efficient and affordable services.”

One Africa Global honcho, Paul Okoye, also said, “It has been my ultimate goal to showcase Africa to the world and create a channel that bridges the gap. I am enthusiastic and equally pleased to announce this partnership. As two proudly African brands come together for a common goal to showcase the very best from Africa, we are on a journey to take Africa to the world and bring the world to Africa.”
