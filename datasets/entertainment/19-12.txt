I ended call when female fan stripped on my Instagram video –Slimcase
Olajide Samuel

Popular artiste, Oluwafemi Oko-Eko, popularly known as Slimcase, has had different experiences with fans ever since he came into the limelight. Recalling some of the weird moments in a chat with SATURDAY BEATS, the ‘Azaman’ singer said a female fan once stripped on his Instagram live video. He stated, “A female fan stripped on my live video. I had to end the video call.”

The singer, who struggled to gain recognition on the music scene years back, before seeming to hit the jackpot last year, lamented that street music had yet to gain recognition outside Nigeria.

He added, “Street music is obviously well appreciated in Nigeria, but it is underrated in the western world due to the obvious language barrier.”

Slimcase, who is set to release his debut album in January 2020, also insisted that contrary to the optimistic forecast in some quarters, the entertainment industry (in Nigeria) was not getting better.

“The entertainment sector is not getting better at all. Whatever happens to the economy affects every business and society as a whole,” he said.
