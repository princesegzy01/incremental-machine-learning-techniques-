Encouraged by the successful completion of Couples Award, Kehinde Olorunyomi recently premiered a new movie titled, Mothers and Daughters-in-Law.

According to the producer, the movie’s message is for mothers and daughters-in-law to give one another a chance for peace to reign in the home.

“Everyone is not the same. So, don’t expect the other person to be like you. There is the need for patience and tolerance with the understanding that backgrounds are different,” Olorunyomi said.

Speaking further, Olorunyomi stated that mothers-in-law should not forget that a woman’s place is in her husband’s house, stressing that it was important for them to allow their daughters-in-law to run their own homes.

“I don’t think it is ideal for daughters and mothers-in-law to stay together for too long because space (distance) brings respect, while familiarity brings contempt. I think it is better and safer for mothers-in-law to simply visit briefly and go back to their homes in order to maintain their dignity and respect. The vision I have for Mothers and Daughters-in-Law is to complete the trilogy and eventually make a long-term series out of it.”
