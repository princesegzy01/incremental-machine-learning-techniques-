African Voices Changemakers Compilation Show debuts
Tofarati Ige

The maiden edition of the Compilation Show of CNN African Voices Changemakers, which gives a recap of past three editions broadcast in a month, will be aired this weekend.

The magazine programme sponsored by Globacom will refresh viewers’ memories about the three change makers earlier featured on African Voices Changemakers.

The programme which showcases outstanding personalities from across the continent will celebrate Crystal Chigbu, who has impacted the lives of several amputated children by providing them with artificial limbs through her Irede Foundation.

The show will also highlight the contributions of 27-year-old Seyi Oluyole, whose Dream Catchers programme has employed choreography to positively change the fate of despondent street kids and indigent youths through dance. The initiative had such a global impact that it attracted the attention of global stars, Rihanna and Naomi Campbell. Naomi even visited the base of the Dream Catchers in Ikorodu, Lagos, during a visit to Nigeria.

Similarly, the programme will feature WeCyclers founder, Bilikiss Abiola, whose rare initiative of the incentivised refuse collection got Lagos city dwellers excited to recycle their waste. WeCyclers currently has more than 80 employees who use tricycles to gather the waste from homes across the city for recycling.

The first two women are part of a community of change agents who have displayed altruism and an enviable passion for children just as Abiola’s waste to wealth creation drive has contributed to the protection of Nigeria’s ecosystem.
