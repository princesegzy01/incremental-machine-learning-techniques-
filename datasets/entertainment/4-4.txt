Why I dedicated song to Leah Sharibu –Nimi Grace
Mobola Sadiq

Ondo State-born kid sensation, Nimi Grace, is not a regular girl child. She’s a talented violinist, who started honing her musical skills at the age of four. She also does activism with her music.

She told Saturday Beats that she wants to use her music to correct some of the ills in the society. She said, “There are a lot of issues facing young girls in Nigeria today and I’m not happy about this. I want to use my music to bring attention to things like rape, human trafficking, child labour and domestic abuse.”

Speaking on her current projects, the 10-year-old singer said, “I will release an album soon and it will be titled, ‘Mama Africa’, with songs such as ‘African Child’, ‘Mama Africa’ and ‘Leah Sharibu’.

“After that, I will embark on a nationwide promotional tour. The song, ‘Leah Sharibu’, is dedicated to the female student of the Government Girls Science and Technical Secondary School, Dapchi, Yobe State, who was abducted by Boko Haram terrorists in February, 2018, and is still in their custody. It is an emotional track that assures Sharibu that the world is waiting for her release.”

Grace also said her music interest does not affect her studies. She added, “Music is my calling and it does not affect my academics. Although managing both has not been easy but the place of focus and planning has helped me to combine both with ease.”
