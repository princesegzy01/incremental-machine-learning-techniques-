2019 BBNaija: Tacha, Mercy, three other housemates face eviction
The housemates up for possible eviction on the Big Brother Naija ‘Pepper Dem Gang’ show were nominated on Monday.

They are Tacha, Kimoprah, SirDee, Ella and Frodd.

Frodd, however, due to the veto power card he won earlier in the game, had the power to save himself and replace with another housemate of his choice.

So he saved himself and put Mercy up for possible eviction.
