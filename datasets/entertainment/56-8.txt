Fast rising singer, Elvis Blaze, is currently proving that he is a force to be reckoned with in the Nigerian music scene, especially with his newly released song titled, ‘Kolawole’, which has been getting airplay.

In a chat with Saturday Beats, he stated that with success comes women and his prayer is that God should give him the wisdom to handle his female fans so he would not be distracted. “I thank God for his beautiful creations – women. I have always asked God for the spirit of discernment between good and bad so that I can do the things that will please Him. So, God will give me the wisdom with which I will manage my female fans. My fans are the reason for the season, I value and respect them but I will not allow them to be a distraction,” he said.

Eagerly speaking about his latest work, he said, “’Kolawole’ is a motivational song fused with afro flavor. It is a song I want the general public to enjoy because it is loaded with meaningful motivational messages, good lyrics, and good beats. It’s a song you will like to listen to on repeat.”
