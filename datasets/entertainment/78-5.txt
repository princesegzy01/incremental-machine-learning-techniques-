Actress, Doris Simeon, left Nigeria for the United States of America last year and it seems she may not be coming back anytime soon.

Sunday Scoop exclusively gathered that she had vacated her apartment in an estate in Ogba, Lagos. It was learnt that when she initially left the country last year, the apartment was occupied by her younger brother. However, the brother also moved out of the apartment earlier this year.

Although the details behind her move to America are not clear at the moment, it was learnt that she probably made the move to be closer to her son, David.

For some years now, David has been living in the US with his dad, Daniel Ademinokan, and his wife, Stella Damasus.

Calls put through to Simeon’s telephone did not connect. She also didn’t reply messages sent to her on WhatsApp.
