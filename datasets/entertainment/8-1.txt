Zlatan’s running battle with cultists

Music artiste, Omoniyi Raphael, popularly known as Zlatan Ibile, is obviously having a good year.

However, the singer, who is famous for his catchphrase, ‘Kapachumarumarichipaco’, seems to be having trouble with a cult group.

Few days ago, a video showed some alleged Aiye cult members attacking Zlatan, during his show at DonRecky Hall, New Jersey, US. A shirtless Zlatan could be seen trying to leave a rowdy hall while some members of his crew formed a tight circle around him, apparently to protect him from being assaulted.

The clip also showed Zlatan being shoved hard from the back while a man could be heard appealing to the rowdy audience to remain calm.

However, that wasn’t the first time the Illuminati singer had been harassed by suspected cult members. In April, soldiers whisked Zlatan out of the Gateway Polytechnic, Saapade, Ogun State, after some cult members tried to attack him.

The scary altercations have, however, not distracted the 24-year-old singer who was nominated in four categories of the Headies Awards holding today.

His bromance with superstar singer and DMW boss, Davido, also earned him a loud ovation from fans during the week as he was gifted a customised necklace by the former.

An elated Zlatan then took to his Instagram page to appreciate Davido.

When Saturday Beats reached out to one of Zlatan’s handlers, Esther Igbuan, she didn’t respond to the calls and messages sent to her phone.
