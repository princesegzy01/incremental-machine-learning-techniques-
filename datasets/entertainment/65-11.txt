Why Waje and I are best friends –Omawumi
When mentioning the list of ‘besties’ in the Nigerian music industry, singers, Waje and Omawumi, would be at the top of the list. The duo have been friends for so long that they recently launched an entertainment outfit together.

In a chat with Saturday Beats, Omawumi shared the secret to their longtime friendship. She noted that although they had issues from time to time, they always found ways to work things out.

The songstress said, “It is very easy to work with women, especially those that are professionals. Sometimes, people have the impression that women are supposed to be slow and that we do not grasp things easily but the truth is that women are one of the best multitaskers in the world. So, when you give a woman a task, she thinks of how she can be the best at the job and also the best version of herself so that you can come back and work with her.

“As regards me and Waje, we have been friends for a long time and I always tell her that if we were a man and woman and had a child together, the child would have become a teenager by now. It does not mean that we do not have issues but whenever such happens, we sit down and trash them out. I think that it is one of the things that make us friends and good business partners.”
