Festival urges unity among Nigerians
Nigerians have been urged to be more united and show commitment towards developing the society.

The call, which was made at the 2019 edition of Eledumare Festival held in Lagos earlier in the week, saw culture enthusiasts including arts academics giving various perspectives to the link between culture and development.

Leading the call during the festival was the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, who said that for genuine progress to come to the land, individuals from all parts of the country must work as a unit to move the society forward.

He said, “There are several aspects of our culture which promote unity and shine light on the significance of that in our national development as a country.

“Eledumare Festival is one of the ways that those of us who are custodians of culture are using to reiterate why we must work together as a unit regardless of the part of the country we are from to move Nigeria forward.

“As Nigerians, we must begin that push from the cultural perspective because it is through the morals and values embedded in it that we can entrench a system where development occurs.”

Guest lecturer at the annual event, Professor Orimogunje of the Department of Linguistic and African Studies, University of Lagos, while agreeing with Adams in his submission, said that efforts must be made to promote key aspects of the indigenous culture as according to him this is one of the ways we could ensure peace and progress in the country.
