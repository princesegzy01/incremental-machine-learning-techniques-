The Chairperson of the Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode, has said the equitable share of the clubs from two different zones of the country would make the 2018/19 Nigeria Women Premier League Super 4, which begins on Tuesday (today) more competitive.

She said this on Monday, ahead of the commencement of the competition at the Agege Stadium.

She said, “It’s the first time, we are having two teams each from the Northern part of the country and two from the Niger Delta, coming together to battle for the Premier League title in the Super 4 Challenge.

“This time around we have added some innovations that would make the Super 4 interesting to all Nigerian women’s soccer fans.

“I want to assure Nigerians that they would see an improved standard of play in all the matches that would be played at the Agege Stadium.”

Bayelsa Queens head coach, Moses Aduku, said his squad are determined to repeat what they achieved last year, defeating Nasarawa Amazons in the final of the Super 4.
