I’m not thinking of retirement –Martins
Kelvin Ekerete

Former Nigeria international, Obafemi Martins, has revealed he is still active and has no intention of retiring from football as he seeks a new club.

The former Inter and Newcastle striker who recently returned from a torn muscle fibre injury he picked up at his last club in China (Shanghai Shenhua) says he is in no hurry to find another club and the thoughts of retirement has never crossed his mind.

”I love football and I’m still passionate about it, so retirement thoughts haven’t crossed my mind,” Martins said.

”I cannot rush into the next club because at this stage I can make important decisions for myself and my body,” he told BBC.

”I want to enjoy the game and when I find the right place it will not be a difficult thing to do,” he added.

Martins scored 32 goals and provided nine assists in 59 appearances for his last club – Chinese Super League side Shenhua – before a season-ending injury in April 2018.

The former Inter Milan and Levante forward moved to China from Major League Soccer (MLS) side Seattle Sounders in February 2016, and achieved domestic success in Asia.
