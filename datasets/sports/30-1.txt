Since joining English Premier League side Leicester City from Belgian side KRC Genk in 2017, Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has been rated as one of the best defensive midfielders in the EPL.

A recently released statistics by popular football statistics website whoscored.com revealed that the Nigerian international has had more successful tackles than any other player in England including hard tackling Chelsea midfielder, Ngolo Kante.

Since joining Leicester, Ndidi has made a total of 394 successful tackles a whopping 92 more tackles than second placed Idrissa Gueye, and 131 tackles more than Chelsea star Ngolo Kante.

His ability to regain possession also has an obvious impact on Leicester’s record at the back, with no team having conceded fewer goals in the Premier League (eight).

Ndidi ranks first in England’s top-flight for interceptions this season (32) and second to teammate Ricardo Pereira for tackles (45). He has topped the charts for the latter in each of his previous two full seasons in the Premier League, and despite his incredibly high volume of tackles, Ndidi has never been suspended due to an accumulation of yellow cards.
