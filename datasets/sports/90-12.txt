Okwaraji: Documentary, memorial lecture for fallen hero
Sodiq Oyeleke

The family of late Super Eagles midfielder, Sam Okwaraji, has accused the Federal Government of failing to fulfill its promise of immortalising the late footballer.

Elder brother of the football icon, Mr Patrick Okwaraji, made the disclosure on Monday while unveiling plans to launch a documentary to mark the late footballer’s 30-year memorial.

Okwaraji slumped and died on August 12, 1989 at age 25 during a World Cup qualifier against Angola at the National Stadium, Lagos. He had a Master’s Degree in International Law from Rome.

While saying “the Federal Government has failed to fulfill its promises to immortalise Okwaraji,” the family’s representative added that there would also be a `Samuel Okwaraji Memorial Lecture.

“The documentary is part of activities lined up for the 30 years memorial of his short but eventful life. The title of the documentary is Patriotism, Education and Soccer,’’ he added.

Former Super Eagles Captain, Henry Nwosu, urged the Imo State Government to endorse the project, adding that the planned project would motivate others to do more for the country.

“I was in the Super Eagles when Okwaraji came into the national team. However, since his untimely death in Lagos, the Federal Government has not done much to honour him or to take care of his family, which is unfortunate.

“Ex-Eagles players are all behind the project, we have endorsed it and also called on stakeholders to do same in honour of our late hero,” he said.
