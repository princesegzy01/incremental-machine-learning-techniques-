Watford striker, Isaac Success, has resumed training after being out with a groin injury.

This was confirmed by the club’s Head of Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation Alberto Leon.

Leon said Success was feeling good and would start training with the club.

“Isaac Success was also out on the grass this morning as he nears a comeback following a groin problem,” he told the club’s website.

“He will start training with the team.

“He is feeling really good. He has been working really hard and we hope he can be like Capoue and Prödl and start modified training.”

Success has played three games for The Hornets this season.
