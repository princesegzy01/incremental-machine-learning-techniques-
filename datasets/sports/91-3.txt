Imama confident of CHAN qualification

Home-based Super Eagles Coach Imama Amapakabo is confident his team will redeem their image when they take on Togo in a 2020 African Nations Championship second leg, second round qualifying match on October 19.

Togo thrashed the Eagles 4-1 in a first leg, second round qualifying match of the 2020 African Nations Championship qualifier in Lome last month.

Nigeria need to score at least three unreplied goals to qualify for next year’s CHAN tournament, following the defeat.

“Psychologically and mentally my players need help after back-to-back defeats to Togo,” Amapakabo told The PUNCH.

“But we know what to expect in this crucial game and will make some drastic changes to ensure we secure qualification for the tournament.

“It’s not going to be easy but we have no reason to fail a third time against Togo.”

The PUNCH also gathered that the list of players invited for the game will be released on Wednesday.
