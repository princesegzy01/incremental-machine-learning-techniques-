Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu, has assured young keeper Maduka Okoye that he will get his chance to feature for the national team, though he refused to say if it will be against Brazil in the international friendly on Sunday.

Agu, who heaped praises on the young goalkeeper, said that he had no doubt that he will come good for the national team at the right time.

“Okoye will definitely get the chance he deserves,” he said.

“His time will come and I can assure that. Rome was not built in a day, but eventually it was built. So, also is the situation with Okoye.

“He is adapting very well with the team and I have been really impressed with him.

“I can’t tell when he will play, I have never done that before and I am not going to start now because I have never let the cat out of the bag before a game. But I’m optimistic that he will get the chance soon.”

The former Nigeria keeper added, “He is a very promising goalkeeper, he is young with so much quality and we are also helping him to grow in some areas and get better than he is at the moment.

“We need to be careful with him and I see the future looking good in that department for the national team and even for his club side.”
