NFF won’t rush to sack Garba –Sanusi
Nigeria Football Federation general secretary Mohamed Sanusi says it will not rush to sack under-17 coach Manu Garba after the country’s exit from World Cup in Brazil.

The Golden Eaglets, who are the most successful side in the tournament with five titles, suffered a 3-1 round of 16 defeat to the Netherlands on Wednesday.

“There’s no truth to reports in the media that the coach has been sacked,” Sanusi said.

“We understand the disappointment of the fans but the coach has a contract with the federation and there’s no rush or whatsoever.

“The standard procedure must be followed. For now the NFF technical committee is expecting a comprehensive technical report from the coach about the tournament in Brazil.

“Any decisions going toward will be presented to the board by the technical committee.”

His comments came after Nigeria’s sports minister Sunday Dare called for a review of the campaign in Brazil and of the Nigeria football (NFF) administration.

“Nigeria’s performance at the Under -17 World Cup calls for a review,” Dare revealed on his official social media.

“Indeed, our football administration at all levels calls for a review. We must exact greater responsibility from those charged with our football administration.”
