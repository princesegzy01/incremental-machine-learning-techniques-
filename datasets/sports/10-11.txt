PSG goalkeeper Navas suffers injury in warm-up
Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Keylor Navas suffered a thigh injury in the warm-up and had to pull out of the French champions’ game against Brest on Saturday.

The Costa Rican was replaced in the starting line-up by Sergio Rico, handing the Spaniard his PSG debut after joining in the close-season on loan from Sevilla.

Navas’ injury adds to PSG coach Thomas Tuchel’s fitness woes, with Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, defenders Thomas Meunier and Thilo Kehrer and midfielder Ander Herrera all sidelined.

In-form striker Mauro Icardi was only fit enough for a place on the bench in Brittany.
