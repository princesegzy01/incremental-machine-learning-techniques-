Goals scoring burden not for me alone –Osimhen
Ebenezer Bajela

Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen, admitted he is ready to share the Eagles’ scoring responsibilities with other players in the team.

The 20-year-old Lille forward said being a striker, he is expected to score for the team but it is a burden he is not willing to carry alone as he expects other players to score as well.

“Of course I will always try to get goals for the team but I am not the only striker in the team,” he stated.

“We have Samuel Chukwueze, Samuel Kalu and of course the captain, Ahmed Musa, who is back with us.”

Osimhen’s goal record for the Eagles is in sharp contrast to his form for his club side where he has scored nine goals in 17 matches, an average of one goal in two matches compare to his two goal in eight matches for Nigeria.
