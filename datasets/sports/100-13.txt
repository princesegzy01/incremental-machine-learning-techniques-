Pogba out of France squad as Mbappe, Kante return
Paul Pogba was left out of the France squad named Thursday for their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Iceland and Turkey, but N’Golo Kante and Kylian Mbappe both return.

Pogba is currently struggling with a foot problem and was not named in Manchester United’s squad to play AZ Alkmaar in the Europa League on Thursday, although he did play in Monday’s 1-1 draw with Arsenal.

Kante has had an injury-hit start to the season and did not feature in France’s home wins over Albania and Andorra last month, while Mbappe has only just returned from a hamstring injury.

Elsewhere, Mbappe’s PSG teammate Presnel Kimpembe returns with fellow defenders Samuel Umtiti and Aymeric Laporte sidelined.

Tottenham Hotspur’s Tanguy Ndombele makes his comeback as Arsenal’s Matteo Guendouzi drops down to the under-21 squad, and there is a recall for back-up goalkeeper Steve Mandanda of Marseille.
