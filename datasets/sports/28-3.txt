EPL: Mane caps thrilling Liverpool fightback to sink Villa
Jurgen Klopp’s side were in danger of losing in the league for the first time this season after Trezeguet put the hosts ahead in the first half at Villa Park.

But Robertson equalised with four minutes left and Senegal winger Mane grabbed the winner in the fourth minute of stoppage-time to maintain Liverpool’s six-point lead over second placed Manchester City, who also came from behind to beat Southampton 2-1.
