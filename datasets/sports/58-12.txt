Lille under pressure to keep Osimhen – Campos
Johnny Edward

Lille sporting director, Luis Campos, has admitted that Les Dogues will be under severe assault when the transfer window reopens should their in-form striker, Victor Osimhen, continues his scoring form for the club.

The 20-year-old striker has been outstanding for Lille since he arrived from Sporting Charleroi for €12m in August, scoring eight goals and providing two assists in 12 appearances for Lille.

Osimhen has been linked with moves to Barcelona, Manchester United and Newcastle.

“When you are a club like Lille, it is difficult to keep hold of a striker who scores goals,” Campos told RMC.

“We’ll be under assault if he continues like this.

“It is normal, in the way football currently is, all the players who have arrived at Lille in this project, the idea is to continue to help them to improve, for them to help the club and the team to improve in return.”

Osimhen will be aiming to bag his second UEFA Champions League goal when Lille hosts Valencia on match day three on Wednesday
