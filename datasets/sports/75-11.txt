GOtv Boxing Night Mini debuts
A mini version of the GOtv Boxing Night, tagged GOtv Boxing Night Mini, is set to start.

The inaugural edition holds on November 16 at Rowe Park, Yaba, Lagos.

This was announced on Monday by the organisers, Flykite Productions, at a media parley in Lagos.

Jenkins Alumona, CEO Flykite, explained that GOtv Boxing Night Mini was conceived to provide more frequent opportunities for boxers as a means of ensuring that they get requisite number of fights to make them eligible for sub-regional, continental and international title bouts.

“Our boxers have, despite the best efforts of GOtv Boxing Night, inadequate opportunities to fight and build their fight records, which they need to become eligible for international titles. GOtv Boxing Night Mini, which will be staged with more frequency than the main event, will address this challenge,” he said.

Alumona also explained that the 20th GOtv Boxing Night, which was planned to hold on Saturday, has been fused into the mega edition of the event slated for December. The development, he said, was imposed by the injury suffered in training by Oto “Joe Boy” Joseph, African Boxing Union lightweight champion, who was scheduled to defend his title against Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, the West African Boxing Union champion in the much-anticipated headline bout.

Some of the other boxers slated to fight at GOtv Boxing Night 20 will, however, feature at GOtv Boxing Night Mini.
