The home-based Super Eagles crashed out of the ongoing WAFU Nations Cup in Senegal after losing their second match 4-2 on penalties to Cape Verde after regulation time ended 1-1 on Saturday.

Nigeria lost their first match 2-1 to Togo, which saw them crash out of contention for the trophy. Saturdayâ€™s loss to Cape Verde meant they failed to reach the semi-final of the plate competition.

The CHAN Eagles took the lead in the 64th minute through Lobi Stars striker Sikiru Alimi but the Cape Verdeans equalised in the 87th minute as the game went straight to penalties

The Eagles failed to convert three of their kicks, which ensured they were eliminated from the competition.

With the win, Cape Verde progressed to the semi-finals of the plate competition and will next face the winners between Liberia and Niger.Copyright PUNCH.
