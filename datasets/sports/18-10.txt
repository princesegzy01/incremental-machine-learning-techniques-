Players’ representatives John Viola and Philip McTaggart have urged football agents in Nigeria to prioritise training.

They said this during the launch of a mobile application by a UK-based company, ASQ Training and Development, for level three certificates in football intermediary qualification.

Viola, who was part of the successful careers of players like Luis Figo and Roberto Carlos, noted that “training would help those looking to succeed in the complex but lucratively rewarding profession of player management.”

Viola said ASQ has identified the need for necessary training and certification, encouraging budding football agents to get their acts right.

McTaggart advised that intermediaries should embrace the ASQ training for the general interest of football.

He said, “Aside from getting the ability to sell quality players, participating in the ASQ development training will avail the agents the many advantages including a rich global network.

“The participants will learn the rudiments and dynamics of the global football market thereby reduce the incidences of Nigerian players being rejects abroad.”

ASQ Group Managing Director, Samson Adeosun, said many football agents in Nigeria and Africa don’t have proper experience.

He said, “The idea for a developmental programme for football intermediaries was borne out of my personal experience.

“It was after I got my intermediary licence from the English FA that I realised that I virtually did not know what next to do, and this is the experience of most agents in Africa.”
