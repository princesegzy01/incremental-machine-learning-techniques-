Prudent Energy League: Defenders return to winning ways
Defenders (Civil Defence) returned to winning ways on Thursday beating COAS Shooters (Nigerian Army) 37-31 in an exciting encounter at the ongoing Prudent Energy Handball League in Lagos.

The Civil Defence team had lost narrowly to Niger United (28-30) on Wednesday but took their chances against the Nigerian Army to bounce back into contention. The Army side were undone by slack defending towards the end of the game.

Also, Prison Key defeated Borno Spiders to record their first win in 17 games. The losing streak started from the first phase in Abuja, with the Prison boys only having a draw to their name. However, they were in jubilant mood inside the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Complex, Yaba after the win.

In another game, Owena Queens of Akure lost 37-30 to Kada Queens despite putting up an impressive performance.

The Ondo State team occupy the rear on the league table after winning just one game in 15 matches.

Champions Plateau Peacocks also recorded another victory, beating Abia Valiants 27-16 to maintain their third spot on the table.

Peacocks were the dominant side in the game and they made it count by seeing off the Valiants, who are second from behind, in easy fashion.
