Dandling axe! Emery faces Arsenal sack if…
Unai Emery risks losing his job as Arsenal manager if he fails to deliver a return to the Champions League after spending £152million on new players in the summer.

Arsenal are once again competing in Europe’s second tier competition, with the club and fans longing to be back in the Champions League this season.

The Gunners currently sit third in the table – which would be enough to secure their place – but Head of Football Raul Sanllehi has admitted anything less is not good enough.

Speaking at a fans’ forum on Thursday night, he admitted, ‘We said to Unai that we just missed out on qualifying for the Champions League last year, but this year with a stronger squad, we expect you to do that.’

It is not the first time the club’s hierarchy have fronted up and met the fans.

In the past, they have held a series of forums, in which they take questions from supporters and clear up any ongoing issues.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the subject of Mesut Ozil was also brought up, with the £350,000-a-week midfielder failing to even make the matchday squad of late.

When questioned about his future, Sanllehi said, ‘‘Unai’s policy has always been to play the ones that work hard in training.’’
