He beat jonathan Ikone and Loic Remy to the award.

Osimhen who was Lille’s hero at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy on Sunday, scored 10 minutes from time to rescue a 2-2 draw for Les Dogues at home to Nimes Olympique.

Osimhen, 20, who also scored in Lille’s 2-1 Champions League defeat to Chelsea midweek, fired in his seventh Ligue 1 goal of the season from close range after a Renaud Ripart penalty at the end of the first half and Kevin Denkey’s 70th-minute finish had cancelled out Loic Remy’s 13th minute opener.

The striker took him clear of Olympique Lyonnais’ Moussa Dembele and AS Monaco’s Wissam Ben Yedder at the top of the scoring charts.

Lille, who remain in fifth in the Ligue 1 table with 15 points from nine are undefeated in each of their last nine home matches in Ligue 1 and had won the previous eight.

The last time Les Dogues were beaten at their Stade Pierre-Mauroy was in March, when Monaco escaped with a 1-0 win, thanks to Carlos Vinicius’s 90th-minute strike.
