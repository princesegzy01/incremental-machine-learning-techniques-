Former Super Eagles captain Mikel Obi has returned to training after a one-month injury absence.

Mikel picked up a muscle injury in Tabzonspor’s training on October 14 and has been out of action ever since.

He missed his club’s league games against Gaziantep, Instanbul Basaksehir, Goztepe and Alanyaspor.

He was also out of their Europa League home and away games against Krasnodar.

Mikel posted a picture of himself and compatriot Ogenyi Onazi training on Instagram.

The midfielder accompanied the picture with the caption, “Almost ready to be back on the pitch, smile is back.”

Mikel has played 11 times for the Turkish side this season.
