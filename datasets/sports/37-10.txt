AITEO Cup champions Kano Pillars have embarked on one-week close camping in Kaduna ahead of the 2019/20 NPFL season, which kicks off November 3, Sports Extra has gathered.

The Sai Masu Gida, who crashed out in the preliminary stage of the CAF Champions League to Ghana’s Asante Kotoko 4-3 on aggregate, are aiming to land the NPFL title after finishing runners-up to Enyimba last season.

“The team is currently in a closed camp for final preparations ahead of the new season,” the club’s media manager, Idris Malikawa, told Sports Extra.

“We want to lay a marker and intend to do that through this camp. The players are aware of expectations and targets, and are ready for the task.

“The NPFL title is also a goal; hopefully, we’ll wrestle it from Enyimba. The camp will also afford the new recruits to bond with the old players. It’s important to build team solidarity and synergy amongst these players.”
