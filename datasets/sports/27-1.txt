‘Belief helped Australia beat Nigeria’
Ebenezer Bajela

Australia U-17 head coach, Trevor Morgan, has hailed the Joeys’ never-say-die attitude after beating Nigeria 2-1 to advance to the Round of 16 of the U-17 World Cup in Brazil.

The Joeys had fallen behind in their opening two games as they lost 2-1 against Ecuador, before launching a two-goal comeback in a 2-2 draw with Hungary.

Australia started on the front foot in their crucial Group B decider against the five-time champions, who lifted back-to-back titles in 2013 and 2015, and never looked back.

Noah Botic’s double clinched third place behind Nigeria and Ecuador and ensures the Joeys’ Brazilian adventure continues as one of the four best third-place finishers with four points.

Morgan told myfootball.com that their victory over Nigeria was as a result of their commitment and believe.

“We came here to win games and, although Nigeria were fantastic, we got the result,” said Morgan.

“It’s a plus for the boys, for their commitment and belief to come here and play a top team and win.

“They had to dig deep. The Joeys played an excellent team with great quality and great physical capacity. We had to defend well which I think is important in winning. “
