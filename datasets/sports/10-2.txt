The Squirrels of Benin’s impressive last-eight showing at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt should serve as a reminder and a warning to the Super Eagles, says ex international, Mutiu Adepoju.

Nigeria kick-off 2021 AFCON journey against the tiny West African nation at home on the 13th of this month before taking on another minnow in small Southern African and land-locked country, Lesotho four days later.

Michel Dussuyer’s charges stunned Morocco 4-1 on penalties to secure the biggest win in their history by reaching the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals in Egypt before bowing out to Ghana’s Black Stars in the last eight.

And will be the Eagles’ guest at Uyo as both sides kick-off their 2021 AFCON qualifying campaign.

Adepoju is wary of the dangers of taking on less-fancied sides like the Beninoise, citing their AFCON 2019 last-eight bow as a major reason why the Eagles must avoid an upset.

“There is no small team now we saw what the Squirrels did in Egypt. They sent Morocco packing and also gave a good account of themselves in the last eight against Ghana.

“On paper we’re stronger, we’re better. But, this is football. They can create upset if we underestimate them. AFCON is still fresh we saw them in Egypt.

“It is just a reminder for us that you can’t afford to underrate them. Their AFCON showing should be the reason to go all out and secure victory,” he told Sports Extra in a telephone conversation.
