Dortmund director shuts down Mourinho links
Borussia Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc has shot down reports that Jose Mourinho could be heading to the Bundesliga club.

There were reports in Germany this week that the former Manchester United boss had started to learn German and was keeping in regular contact with Dortmund.

Lucien Favre is currently in charge at Westfalenstadion but has come under some pressure after a stuttering start to the season.

Dortmund are currently fourth in the Bundesliga, having picked up just two wins in their last seven games in all competitions.

But Zorc responded strongly to the suggestion that Mourinho could be on his way to BVB.

“We are not having a coach discussion and are happy to have Lucien Favre,” he told Sky in Germany, as reported by the Mirror.

“These rumours around Mourinho lack any substance.”

Despite being fourth in the Bundesliga, Dortmund are just one point behind leaders Borussia Monchengladbach in a very congested table.
