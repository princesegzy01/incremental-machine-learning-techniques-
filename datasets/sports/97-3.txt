The international friendly game between Nigeria and Brazil scheduled to take place on October 13 in singapore, has saw a change in the date of the Brasileiro Série A after club owners and managers criticised the timing of the match with seven players from the league invited.

Tite’s invitation of the players who ply their trade in the topflight has not gone down well with local clubs as the game coincides with match day of the Brazil national championship. It is a situation that has led to friction between club and country.

However, the Brazilian Football Confederation has now moved to end the dispute by releasing 2020 domestic calendar which prevents domestic fixtures from clashing with FIFA dates.

“We are committed to improving the Brazilian football calendar more and more and are doing so in dialogue and with firm goals,” said CBF president Rogerio Caboclo in a statement. “With that, everyone wins, clubs, federations and the Brazilian national team.”

“With the understanding of the State Federations and flexibility on the part of Conmebol, we have reduced the number of dates used by state championships, the Copa Libertadores and the Copa Sul-Americana, making room for FIFA fates to have no conflict with national competitions,” added CBF director of competitions Manoel Flores.
