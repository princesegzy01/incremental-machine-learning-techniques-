FC Enyimba forward, Victor Mbaoma, says the People’s Elephant will play Sunday’s second leg CAF Confederation Cup playoff encounter in Nelspruit without fear of the opposition fans, adding that they will approach the game with respect regardless of the first leg advantage.

In an audio posted on busybuddiesng.com the former Remo Stars captain, who netted his first goal for the 2-time African Champions in their 2-0 first leg win against Galaxy in Aba on Sunday, added that Enyimba will do what is expected of them by preventing the home side from scoring which could put them under pressure.

“We only have to be mindful of them because they are a very good team,” Mbaoma said.

“We just have to respect them, and the only way we can respect them is to give them a very tough game, by doing what we are supposed to do – marking and taking everything serious.

“We just have to prevent them from scoring us because that is the most important thing that we have to take very serious there.”

At home in Nelspruit, the South African Cup holders are expected to enjoy the vociferous support of their fans. However, the former Akwa United loanee believes Enyimba won’t be intimidated by the presence of the home fans.

“We are two goals ahead and I think that’s a lot of advantage for us,” he added. “And I don’t think the fans there will put in any fear into our hearts because we are all professionals. We just have to get the job done.

“So, it doesn’t matter, even if the crowd is actually against us, the most important thing is to get the job done.”

Overall winners of the tie will book a place in the lucrative group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup.
