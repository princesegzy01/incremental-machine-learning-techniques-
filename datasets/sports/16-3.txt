Zambia are set to face Nigeria and Ivory Coast for the first time in the tournament.

The Chipolopolo will face Nigeria on November 12 before wrapping up against Ivory Coast three days later.

Chambeshi said, “We are one of the team’s that has qualified for the tournament, not by chance, but through hard work. The draws are very tricky and we have to respect each team in the group because they are no pushovers. All the teams in the group are tough.

“We really need a positive result in the first game because that will give us direction. All the games are important, they lead the way,” Chambeshi said.
