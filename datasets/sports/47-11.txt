Ahead of their Sunday’s CAF Confederation Cup, Enyimba head coach Usman Abd’Allah has hailed the technical and tactical competency of their South African opponent, TS Galaxy, saying that the Peoples Elephant must be at their best to defeat the South Africans.

Galaxy beat Kaizer Chiefs to win the Nedbank Cup in May and are the first South African second-tier league side to feature in the Confederation Cup.

They qualified for the playoff round after a 4-1 aggregate victory over CNapS Sport of Madagascar.

And speaking ahead of the playoff first leg tie against Galaxy at the Enyimba Stadium, Aba, Abd’Allah who after falling out of the Champions League to Al-Hilal, stressed that the Confederation Cup represents Enyimba’s last chance to win a continental title this season says his team are not taking anything for granted against the South African Minnows.

“They are a team with a very good technique and tactics,” Abd’Allah said of their South African opponents.

“They have a very good youth development over there, so you can see they have a very good technical and tactical ability.”

“We are not taking anything for granted as we are expecting the team to be a very, very good team.

“They win their matches away also and they are a goalscoring team at away so we are all aware of that, that is why we have been preparing a lot so that we can work on our technical and tactical ability that can match this team,” Abd’Allah told the club’s media channel.

The return leg of the encounter comes up in South Africa on 3 November with winners on aggregate progressing to the group stages.
