Ahmed Musa has warned the Super Eagles to expect a tougher clash when they take on Lesotho on match-day two of their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Maseru-Setsoto Stadium on Sunday, November 17.

The three-time AFCON winners kicked off their qualifying campaign on a bright note defeating Benin 2-1 in Uyo.

“It was a tough game today (Wednesday) against Benin but we got the job done,” Musa told a post-match conference.

“Ahead of the game against Lesotho (on Sunday), it’s going to be harder because we will be playing on a hard surface.

“Not all players in the team are comfortable playing on such turf but we know what every Nigerian expect from us so we will be going to Maseru not to disappoint.”

Musa who was a late substitute in Wednesday’s AFCON clash against Benin will be hoping to make 89th appearance for the team.

Should he get some minutes in Maseru, Musa will equal Mikel Obi international caps for Nigeria.

“If the coach sticks with the same team again, it will be okay by me.

“I watched the match and they played well,” Musa added.
