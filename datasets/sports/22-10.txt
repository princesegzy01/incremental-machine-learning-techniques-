Rangers coach Benedict Ugwu has assured fans that the club would improve on goalscoring ahead of their next encounter the CAF Confederation Cup.

Ugwu said this after his side advanced to the group stage of the Confederation Cup with a 1-0 win against ASC Kara at the Nnamdi Azikwe Stadium, Enugu on Sunday.

Rangers reached the group stage with superior away goal as the first leg ended 2-1 in Togo.

According to Ugwu, securing a group stage ticket was tough for the Enugu-based club.

He appealed to the fans to be patient with the team, assuring them that the players would do better in subsequent matches.

”It was a good match as we were made to suffer after the interval but we would have scored more goals if not that we missed chances.

“We are going to work on our scoring so that we can scale the hurdle of the group stage,” he added.
