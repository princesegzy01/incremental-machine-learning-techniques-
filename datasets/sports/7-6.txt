Coach of Nigeria’s U-23 team, Imama Amapakabo, says his players are determined to win their remaining group matches at the ongoing U-23 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

In their Group B opener, the Nigerians lost 1-0 to Ivory Coast at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo.

Nigeria take on Zambia at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo on Tuesday (today) in a game they must pick up the maximum points to return to contention for a place in the semi-finals of the competition, ahead of their clash with South Africa on Friday.

The team received a big boost for today’s make-or-break battle against Zambia with the arrivals of team captain Azubuike Okechukwu and forward Taiwo Awoniyi.

A statement by the Nigeria Football Federation on Monday stated that Amapakabo was confident the players’ arrival would spur his squad to a better performance against the Zambians.

He said, “I am happy we now have Awoniyi and our captain, Azubuike. They are integral to the team and were influential in our qualifying matches. We will throw everything into the game against Zambia because we have left ourselves no choice at this point.

“I believe we have the team to not only overcome Zambia but go all the way in the tournament. We stumbled against the Ivorians but we have learnt from that and we now look forward to rescuing our campaign against the Zambians and South Africans.”

Only the top three finishers at the U-23 AFCON will qualify to fly Africa’s flag at the Men’s Olympic Football Tournament in Tokyo, Japan next year.
