Tottenham fear Kane summer exit
Tottenham Hotspur allegedly fear that Harry Kane may express a desire to leave the club during the summer transfer window.

Having come through the academy setup to score 171 goals from 262 appearances in all competitions, the forward is effectively regarded as a certain starter every week for the North London outfit.

However, while the 26-year-old has a contract until the end of the 2023-24 campaign, the England international is keen to win trophies, something which he is yet to do with Spurs during his professional career.

According to The Times, Spurs are growing increasing concerned that Kane will look for a way out of the club should they fail to improve on their inconsistent start to the season.

The 7-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday, combined with several squad members said to be keen on a fresh challenge elsewhere and the uncertainty surrounding boss Mauricio Pochettino, have left Spurs in disarray.

The Premier League side would expect to receive in excess of Â£150m should they ever be willing to part ways with their most prized asset.
