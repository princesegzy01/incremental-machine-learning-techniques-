Sao Paulo friendly, good test for Eaglets – Garba
Head Coach of Golden Eaglets, Manu Garba, has said the team’s friendly against Sao Paulo FC of Brazil would be a good test for the players.

The Golden Eaglets tackle the Brazilians in a friendly game on Monday (today), as part of their preparations for this year’s FIFA U-17 World Cup, which begins in Brazil on October 26.

According to a statement by the Nigeria Football Federation, the Nigerian side will file out against Sao Paulo U-17 team at the Saropoca Sports Complex at 7pm (Nigerian time).

Garba said, “The friendly game would help to see how the players are quickly settling down to the task ahead when the global championship kicks off in a fortnight.

“We want to see how they (players) are adapting to some of the things learnt in the training sessions since we came to Sao Paulo.

“The friendly game is one of several we have lined up for the team. We will play Japan next in another friendly game before the end of the week.”

Nigeria will begin their quest for honours at the 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup with a game against Hungary on October 26.
