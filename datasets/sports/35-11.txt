Sobowale on Leicester, Watford radar
Solape Lawal-Solarin with Agency Report

Leicester City and Watford are among the clubs monitoring Ronald Sobowale – the cousin of Bayern Munich star David Alaba.

The striker, who has been in prolific form for non-League club Whyteleafe this season, is currently on trial with Championship club Middlesbrough.

However, a host of clubs in the top two divisions are monitoring the 22-year-old’s progress with West Bromwich Albion and Fulham also showing interest.

Sobowale’s father is the brother of Austria international Alaba’s father and London-born Sobowale is hoping to follow in the footsteps of the Bayern left-back.

He was a contemporary of Tammy Abraham and Dominic Solanke in the youth ranks at Chelsea before being released by the Stamford Bridge outfit at the age of 15.

He has since developed into a speedy and powerful forward now looking to secure a professional contract after scoring 10 goals in 11 matches for Whyteleafe, of the Bet Victor South East League.
