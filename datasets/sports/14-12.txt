Chelsea open to offloading Giroud, Pedro in January
Chelsea could listen to bids for World Cup winners Olivier Giroud and Pedro in January, while Marcos Alonso is facing a fight over his long-term future at Stamford Bridge.

Neither Giroud nor Pedro were part of Frank Lampard’s squad for the dramatic Champions League Group H draw against Ajax on Tuesday night, while Alonso was replaced at half-time by impressive teenager Reece James.

Giroud and Pedro only have just over six months remaining on their contracts and can speak to foreign clubs in January over free transfer summer moves.

But, particularly in the case of Giroud, Chelsea may be open to bids in the next transfer window when they can still demand a fee and save six months of their wages.

Giroud, who has started just one competitive game under Lampard, wants to leave in January in a bid to keep his place in the France side for next summer’s European Championships.

His last action was 20 minutes as a substitute against Burnley last month and the 33 year-old knows he could lose his place in the France side if he remains at Stamford Bridge for the rest of his contract.

There is plenty of interest from France in Giroud, while Crystal Palace and West Ham United are two Premier League clubs who have been linked with him.

Pedro may be more willing to see out the season at Chelsea, but he has also become a peripheral figure in Lampard’s youth revolution. Billy Gilmour was preferred to the Spaniard on the bench this week and he did not even travel to Ajax in the Champions League last month.
