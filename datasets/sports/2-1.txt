The President of the International Olympics Committee, Dr. Thomas Bach, inaugurated the Secretariat of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa in Abuja on Thursday.

This is coming 10 years after the immediate past President of the IOC, Dr Jacques Rogge, laid the foundation on July 6, 2009.

“The development effectively makes Abuja the Olympics City for Africa,” the IOC President said.

The Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr. Sunday Dare, described the event as “a landmark in the development of sports on the continent of Africa.”

“The journey to this day started some 13 years ago when Nigeria alongside six other African countries bided to host the headquarters of ANOCA and become the Olympic capital of Africa.

“After a rigorous selection process, Nigeria was eventually selected as the Host Country for the umbrella body of the Olympic movement in Africa at the General Assembly, which took place in Kenya in June, 2006,” he added.
