Queens Park Rangers coach, Mark Warburton, has hailed Eberechi Eze after his brace ensured the club got a 3-2 win over Hull City in the English Championship.

Eze scored two penalties in the 78th and 88th minutes to ensure his side emerges victorious.

Warburton used the post-match press conference to hail the midfielder’s performance.

Warburton told reporters, “Ebere is a very, very talented young player. There is loads of work for him to do and loads of potential for him to still discover.

“He’s a good player and you saw his quality, his character and his desire to be a better player. He’s a very talented individual and he has a very big future ahead of him.

“Eze is a powerful athlete and he can go left or right. He looks to get on the ball, his awareness is good and he has lots of technical ability. Like all young players, he has to work hard because this can be a spiteful game if you don’t work hard.

“He’s (Eze) a pleasure to work with day-in, day-out, as are Ilias, Brighty, Dom Ball, Ryan Manning; there are a number of very good young players in our squad. We have to keep working with them.

“I’m delighted for Ebere but he will be the first one to say that it is a big three points for the team and now we focus on a tough game against Reading on Tuesday.”

The 21-year-old Ebere joined QPR in 2016, after spending two years at Millwall in 2016. He has scored four goals in 12 appearances for the Championship side this season.

Eze, who has played for England at U-20 and U-21 levels, is eligible to play for the Super Eagles.
