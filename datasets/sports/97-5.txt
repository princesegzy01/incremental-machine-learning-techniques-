Nigerian hurdler, Tobi Amusan, shot putter, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi and long jumper, Ese Brume will feature for Nigeria in Day 9 of the ongoing World Athletics Championships in Doha on Saturday (today).

Enekwechi will fight for a podium finish against the best in the world but will need to throw above the 21.80m personal best and national record, in order to seal his place in the top three spot.

It’s the first time in history a Nigerian, will qualify for the final of the event in the history of the IAAF World Championships after he missed out on the final at the 2017 edition in London.

However, Amusan will run in lane nine of the fifth heat of the 100m women’s hurdles on Saturday (today). Amusan has the second best time in her heat with a time of 12.49 seconds only second to Jamaica’s Janeek Brown who has a PB and SB of 12.40 sec.

In Group A of the long jump event, Brume, will be hoping to make it to the final of the event but will need to finish in the top 12 position or have a jump of 6.75m to make it to the final. Brume will need to work at increasing her personal and season best time of 7.05m to book a spot to the final.
