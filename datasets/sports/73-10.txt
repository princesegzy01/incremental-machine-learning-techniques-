Super Eagle’s midfielder, Ogenyi Onazi, has hinted that he is ready for a dream return to football with Trabzonspor.

Onazi suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury while in action for Trabzonspor in their 4-1 thrashing of Rizespor in December 2018.

The injury setback saw the 26-year-old miss out of the Eagles squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

But having returned to training with the main team two months ago, the Eagles midfielder is hoping for his first appearance in 10 months.

“When I see my people happy I am motivated. I see all your messages I am working hard to come back stronger to achieve our goal for the season. Almost ready,” he wrote on his official Instagram page.

The midfielder will also be eying a return to the competitive national team set up.
