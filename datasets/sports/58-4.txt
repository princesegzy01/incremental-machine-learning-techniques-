Don’t write off Man United – Oliseh
Sodiq Oyeleke

Former Super Eagles coach, Sunday Oliseh, has warned against underestimating Manchester United in the ongoing 2019/20 English Premier League season.

He stated this after the Red Devils ended Liverpool’s 100 per cent start to the season and their 17-match winning streak with a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday.

In a tweet on Monday, Oliseh expressed optimism that Manchester United could still challenge top clubs in the league.

“Pleased to see Rashford and Man United play at such a high level versus Liverpool. Don’t write off Manchester United for the season after today!” the former Ajax and Juventus midfielder tweeted.
