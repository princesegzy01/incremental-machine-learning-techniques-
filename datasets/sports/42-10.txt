Former Super Eagles forward, Victor Moses, has expressed delight at being back from an injury lay-off.

The Fenerbahce forward, who has been out for 10 weeks, played in his club’s 3-0 win over Konyaspor on Saturday.

He last played for the Turkish side in their 5-0 win over Gazisehir Gaziantep on August 19.

He scored Fenerbahce’s first goal in that match before being replaced due to injury.

The forward took to Twitter to express delight at his coming back.

“Great to be back out there and what a win from the boys,” he wrote.
