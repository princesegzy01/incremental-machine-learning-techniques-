Fans have lamented the early ouster of five-time champions Golden Eaglets from the U-17 World Cup in Brazil, urging the Nigeria Football Federation to sack coach Manu Garba.

According to them, Garba has brought a set-back to the nation’s youth football with the team’s poor outing in Brazil.

In an array of comments monitored by our correspondent on social media on Wednesday, majority of the fans blamed Garba for Nigeria’s early elimination in the tournament.

Some of the fans wondered why Garba refused to change the team’s tactics after noticing a shortfall in the defence and midfield.

“What kind of coach is this? We made the same mistakes in all our matches. We conceded too many goals hoping to stage a comeback. The team’s coach needs to be changed if the team must progress,” one of the fans, Sanmi, said.

A student, Abeeb Arokoyo, wrote, “The team’s handlers should have noticed the deficiency in the team when they started struggling from behind to win matches in the group stage.”

An educationist, Babatunde Bello, said the team needed more time together to match the feat of previous teams.

“There are lots of things to learn from this, so that we can get it right again,” he said.
