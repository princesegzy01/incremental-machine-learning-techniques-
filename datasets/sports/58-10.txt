Arsenal captain, Granit Xhaka, has tipped youngster, Bukayo Saka, to go far in his career, stating that the forward is “hardworking and always willing to learn.”

Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has also revealed that the player is an integral part of the team referring to him as an “important player” after the forward leapfrogged Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson in the club’s recent order of importance.

Saka joined Arsenal at eight and has risen through the ranks, making his debut in the Premier League on January 1st against Fulham as an 83rd minute substitute.

“He is respectful, very hard-working and always willing to learn,” Granit Xhaka described the 18-year-old.
