Mudiaga Affe

Zola FC of Ijegun have emerged winners of the maiden Tunde Balogun U-14 grassroots football tournament in Lagos State.

The team defeated Success FC, Mile 2, 9-8 on penalties in the final of the competition played at the Campos Mini-Stadium, Lagos Island, to lift the trophy and claim the cash prize of N250, 000.

The runners-up got N150, 000 for their efforts, while Talented FC, Apapa, who had on Saturday won the third-place match were rewarded with N100,000.

The competition tagged Eko Youths 2019, was organised by the state’s Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Alhaji Tunde Balogun, in conjunction with the Lagos State Grassroots Soccer Association.

The encounter, which started 30 minutes behind schedule due to downpour, saw both sides making spirited attempts to score in the first half.

However, the match was barren until Zola captain Lawal Khaled put his team in the lead in the 55th minute.

But Farook Balogun grabbed the equaliser for Success in the 76th minute to end the tie 1-1.

Zola then held their nerves to win the ensuing shootout.

Zola coach, Adebayo Wasiu, said, “I am happy we won; my boys played well and to instructions. We deserve to win. Success FC are a good side too, they are not an easy team. I think it was a good match for both of us.”

Top personalities at the event includ the state’s Commissioner for Special Duties, Dr Wale Ahmed; Chairman, Surulere Local Government Area, Mr Tajudeen Ajide, the state’s APC vice chairman, Mr Funsho Ologunde; and Assistant Publicity Secretary, Mr Abiodun Salami.

A total of 24 teams across the state participated in the competition.
