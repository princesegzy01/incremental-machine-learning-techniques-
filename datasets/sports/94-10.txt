Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu, says the technical crew of the national team has put in place plans to stop superstar Neymar and other Brazilian stars when they clash with the Selecao in an international friendly scheduled for October 13 at the National Stadium in Singapore.

Speaking to SUNDAY PUNCH, Agu said the players were mentally ready and are motivated ahead of the clash.

“The boys know that every match is a big game irrespective of the opponents because it’s all about 22 players vying for the same ball and purpose. I can assure you that all the boys are determined and they want to win. So I can tell you that they are mentally ready,” he said.

“Brazil is a very big football nation, so also is Nigeria and we are going to give a very good account of ourselves and showcase what we have.”

The 52-year-old ex-Eagles keeper added, “Football is a game that you have to plan for and I won’t talk about our tactics now until then but we have plans to stop Neymar and co.

“The boys are all in good form, they have been fantastic for their various clubs and we expect them to bring that form to the team when we play against Brazil.

“Everybody knows what is at stake. So all the players and the goalkeeping department will go out there knowing their role and do what is expected to bring Nigeria glory.”
