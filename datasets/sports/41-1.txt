Super Eagles defender, Chidiozie Awaziem, is in line to start Leganes’ next La Liga game against giants Real Madrid following injury to Greece international, Dimitris Siovas, in their 1-0 win on Saturday, Sports Extra reports.

Leganes will face Madrid in the week 11 of the Spanish Primera Division on Wednesday at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Siovas was preferred by Leganes interim manager Luis Cembranos in the victory against Mallorca but was substituted in the 31st minute after sustaining an injury with Awaziem brought on to play what’s left of the match.

Cembranos lined up with two central defenders with Siovas partnering Unai Bustinza, a different approach from the tactics of former manager Mauricio Pellegrino, who usually played with three centre backs.

The 22-year-old has made six appearances for Los Pepineros this season starting four of those games.
