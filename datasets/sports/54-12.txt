Golden Eaglets coach, Manu Garba, says his players are determined to win every game at the U-17 World Cup, which begins on October 26 in Brazil.

The Nigerians play their first game against Hungary on October 26.

“The will to win every game is part of the DNA of every Nigerian team, and my team here in Brazil is no exception,” Garba told FIFA website on Tuesday.

“Everyone should get ready to see a fantastic Nigerian team that play great football and have the trophy in their sights.

“Ecuador, Hungary and Australia are undoubtedly strong teams that we respect, but we are record-breaking world champions and I was involved in two of our title wins.”

Nigeria have won the U-17 World Cup a record five times and finished as runners-up in the competition on another three occasions.

The Eaglets, who are among the favourites to win the U-17 World, triumphed in their last outing at the event in Chile in 2015.

Garba was the head coach when the African side clinched victory in the United Arab Emirates in 2013 and served as Yemi Tella’s assistant six years earlier.
