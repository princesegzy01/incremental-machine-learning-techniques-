Prudent League: Leaders Pillars win opening game
Leaders Kano Pillars started their campaign in the second stanza of the 2019 Prudent Energy Handball League with a 25-20 win over rivals COAS Shooters at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Centre, Rowe Park, Yaba.

Pillars arrived at the venue few hours to commencement of the championship but showed no fatigue as they dispatched the Army team to record their first win in the second phase.

Coach Solomon Yola commended his players for shaking off fatigue to record the win

“We are happy to record our first win in Lagos. It took a lot of hard work but it is good to start with a win in the hope that we can sustain the tempo and emerge overall winners of the league. We ended the first phase as leaders and we hope to sustain the momentum in this concluding phase.

“The Army team gave us a run for our money but we defeated them at the end. Hopefully, we will rest well and be ready for today’s game against Borno Spiders.

“We got in early Saturday morning, so beating COAS was exciting. We had a problem with our vehicle on our way to Lagos but it was good to arrive safely and win our opening game. Hopefully, Lagos will be a good hunting ground for us as we approach all our game with vigour,” Yola added.

COAS Shooters coach, Emeka Nnamani, hailed his players despite the defeat.

“We had enough time to prepare. My players played according to plan but unfortunately the game went in favour of Pillars. My players gave their best, I must commend them.”
