Super Eagles defender, Semi Ajayi, is happy with his development as a player, having established himself as a regular for club and country.

The Nigeria international has been a mainstay for Slaven Bilic and has featured in all matches for the Baggies this season, playing a total of 15 games and scoring twice in the process.

In an interview with ESPN, the 25-year-old believes that playing regularly has helped in his progression as a footballer.

“As a young player, you try to improve. The more you play the more you learn about yourself and I have been at Charlton, Arsenal, Cardiff and a few others and each one has been a learning experience for me.

“And what I am now and how I play is a combination of all the experience and the lessons I have taken from all of those clubs and experiences.”

On the performance of his team, Ajayi refused to be carried away despite sitting in third position.

“We are not even halfway to the season yet. There is a still a lot of games to play and I am sure we cannot assess ourselves until we have played at least half season.”
