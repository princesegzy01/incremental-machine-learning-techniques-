Queens Park Rangers’ exciting young forward Eberechi Eze may dump England for the Super Eagles, an official of the national team close to the footballer has said.

The 21-year-old was born in England to Nigerian parents and has represented the country of his birth at U-20 level.

But officials of the Nigeria Football Federation are working to ensure that the youngster pledge international allegiance to the Eagles.

Last month, he was handed a late call-up to the England U-21, a move seen by observers as part of efforts by English officials to block Nigeria’s bid for the player.

But an official of the Eagles said the Nigerian authorities are not giving up and is confident Eze, who has scored six goals and claimed three assists in league matches this term, will take similar decisions like Victor Moses, Alex Iwobi and Ola Aina in chosing Nigeria ahead of England at senior level.

“They are still monitoring him, he is in the England U-21 side now, but very soon, he will be playing at a level higher than that. Once he gets to that stage, we will know.

“He is likely to play for Eagles. He came to our camp in London when we played Senegal in a friendly and he trained with the Eagles. He looks like someone who will come back home,” our source said.
