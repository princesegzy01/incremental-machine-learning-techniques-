Guardiola praises Grealish
Pep Guardiola hailed Jack Grealish as an ‘incredible’ talent following Manchester City’s ultimately comfortable 3-0 win over Aston Villa.

The Premier League champions moved to within three points of table topping Liverpool, albeit having played a game more, after a rampant second half display at the Etihad Stadium.

Villa kept City at bay during the first half, but conceded just 22 seconds after the re-start when Raheem Sterling raced clear to register his 17th goal of the campaign for club and country.

“He’s incredible,” said Guardiola. “A top player. I’m happy he (initially) stayed in the Championship to defend his club.

“He’s a talented player who always creates something. An exceptional player but too expensive for Manchester!”

On his own side’s lacklustre first half display, he added, “It helps a lot we scored in the first minute of the second half. The second half was our game. We played 45 minutes, we didn’t play 90.

“We spoke to each other. After the first half we corrected something, sometimes it happened but the second half was good.

“It’s not about the patience, Raheem was so aggressive but he was the only one. We need more players, more determination. Of course it helped in the second half that we scored the goal.”
