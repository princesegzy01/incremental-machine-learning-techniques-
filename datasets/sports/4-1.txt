South Africa’s U23 coach, David Notoane, is excited with his side’s 1-0 win over the Young Elephants of Ivory Coast and has vowed to replicate same performance on Friday when they take on Nigeria.

A Teboho Mokoena 35-yard free-kick handed Amaglugglug the vital win and three points to take charge of Group B after a 0-0 stalemate with Zambia in their opener.

“We are very happy to get our first win of the tournament, especially against a strong side such as Ivory Coast,” Notoane said.

“This was both a tactical and physical battle which needed a special moment to determine the end result, and I am glad that we are the ones who managed to come up with it,” he told Sport24.

They will face second-placed Nigeria who are a point behind in their final group clash on November 15 at the Al Salam Stadium and Notoane has vowed to give it his all against the West Africans.

“We will prepare accordingly to fight for another winning result in our last group game, which will be against Nigeria,” he stated.
