Former Super Eagles forward, Victor Moses, will be hoping to make a return to competitive football against Denizlispor in a Turkish Super Ligue match on Sunday.

Moses picked up a muscle injury in Fernabahce’s 5-0 thrashing of Gaziantep in August, with just 13 minutes from time, after an impressive performance where he scored a goal and created an assist.

The Turkish giants confirmed that the 2013 African Cup of Nations winner will be out for five weeks, but after seven weeks on the sidelines, the forward is confident of returning to the pitch on Sunday.

“Back in training,” he wrote on his official Instagram handle.

Moses joined Fernebahce on loan from Chelsea has scored one goal and an assist in the only game he featured in this season. He contributed four goals in 22 games for the Turkish side last term.
