’Tosin Oluwalowo

President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare have hailed the Golden Eaglets for coming from behind to defeat Ecuador 3-2 in their U-17 World Cup match on Tuesday.

Ibrahim Said’s hat-trick ensured Nigeria defeated the South Americans and qualified for the Round of 16 in the World Cup.

Their win and qualification excited President Buhari and the sports minister who both praised their fighting spirit.

Special Adviser to the president on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina said, “The fact that the youngsters never gave up, and turned the table against their opponents, is a lesson in persistence and resilience.”

President Buhari also recommended the can-do spirit displayed by the young boys to Nigerians, urging them to display such in all areas of endeavour, and in national development.

Dare in a statement released by his media office also asked the Eaglets to stamp their authority in their next game.

He said, “They have added another page to the story about the resilience of the Nigerian spirit and the ongoing rebirth of our nation led by President Muhammadu Buahri.”

“In your next game stamp again your authority and make Nigeria proud and Nigerians happy. You are indeed the ‘comeback kids’.”

The Eaglets will pay their last group game against Australia on Friday.
