William Troost-Ekong says Super Eagles have quality defenders to stop their opponents in the 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifiers.

He said the Nigerian team’s defence has been strengthened with the return of Kenneth Omeruo after a two-match absence.

Udinese defender Troost-Ekong brushed off suggestions that the return of Leganes of Spain centre-half, Kenneth Omeruo, may affect his chances of playing.

Troost-Ekong and Semi Ajayi put up an impressive performance when Nigeria battled Brazil to a 1-1 draw last month.

On his part, Omeruo was influential in the Eagles’ defence at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt, where the country won bronze.

“I think I am happy to play, full stop,” Troost-Ekong began at the press conference Tuesday afternoon.

“I don’t think it’s always me. Kenneth has played visibly well, Semi (Ajayi) has played well. Like Kenneth said, it is great to have competition in the team.

“Before my time there were other players and after my time there will be new players again.

“So it is good for us to be doing well for our clubs and fighting for the spot. So I think for Nigeria it is only good to have competition.”
