Former Golden Eaglets and Flying Eagles’ captain, Isaac Promise, has passed away at the age of 31.

US club side Austin Bold FC announced the passing away of the player in a statement by its chairman, Bobby Epstein, on Thursday.

The club said the Kaduna-born attacker died late Wednesday after collapsing at his apartment gym in Austin, Texas.

While announcing the former Trabzonspor striker’s death, Bold FC tweeted, “The greatest loss a team can suffer is not on the scoreboard, it’s the death of a fellow teammate.

“It’s with shock and grief that we acknowledge the sudden death of Isaac Promise.

“On behalf of the BOLD organisation; we wish his wife, children and family strength and peace as they struggle to cope with his death.”

Promise captained Nigeria to the 2003 U-17 World Cup in Finland, as well as the 2005 U-20 World Cup in The Netherlands, where the Flying Eagles were runners-up to Argentina.

He also captained the U-23 team at the 2008 Olympics in China and played for the Super Eagles under former coach Samson Siasia in 2009.
