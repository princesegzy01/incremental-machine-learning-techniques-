Owen: I left Liverpool with tears
Michael Owen has told FourFourTwo that he left Liverpool in tears while heading for the airport to complete a move to Real Madrid.

The former Reds and England striker joined the La Liga giants for £8 million in the summer of 2004, having scored 158 goals in 297 games for the Merseyside club.

His time at the Santiago Bernabeu was much less successful, however, Owen lasted only one season in which he scored 16 goals in 45 games for Madrid.

The former striker has admitted that he was heartbroken to leave the club where he started his career, and recalled his emotional journey to Real Madrid.

Speaking about that 2004 summer transfer window in the latest issue of FourFourTwo magazine, he said, “The last thing I thought was that I was going to leave Liverpool.

“Eventually I agreed. But do you know when you sign something and think there’s no going back? I remember crying my eyes out as I went off to the airport thinking ‘What am I leaving behind?’”
