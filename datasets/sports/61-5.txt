Former Super Eagles coach, Jo Bonfrere, has blamed Super Eagles B’s exit from the CHAN 2020 on attackers of the team.

Despite their 2-0 win against Togo at the Agege Stadium in Lagos on Saturday, the Eagles failed to qualify for the 2020 CHAN, losing 4-3 on aggregate.

Bonfrere faulted the attackers for not converting their chances.

He said, “The wingers were very good and were mesmerising the Togolese defence, but they didn’t take advantage of that, rather deciding to play long balls that were ineffective.”

Also speaking on the painful loss, the Nigerian team coach, Imama Amapakabo, said the Eagles lost the match due to unavailability of some important players for the team.

“We lost and that was painful for everybody. The two games were completely different from each other and the tactics were also different.

“The opposing team came with the tactics of defending through putting in more defenders while we want to have our goals.

“The seven changes in the team for the second leg was due to the non-availability of Enugu Rangers players for the first leg.”
