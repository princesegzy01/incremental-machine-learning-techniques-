Solape Lawal-Solarin

Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, is highly rated at Leicester.

His scintillating performances for the KingPower outfit has endeared him to the Foxes’ faithful and at the same time courted the admiration of league leaders, Liverpool, who were reportedly considering a £50m bid for the Super Eagles star last season.

The Nigeria international has been a mainstay of the Foxes ever since completing a £17m switch from Genk in 2017.

And according to Spanish website, futbolera 10, via their Instagram handle, Ndidi is the best recruitment the Foxes have made since N’golo Kante.

“We won’t say he is the new N’golo Kante, but what Ndidi has done for Leicester is awesome. He has brought a balance never seen during the Frenchman days.

“It was hard to adapt but, it was taking a new level, now he is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and another future millionaire sale.”

Kante starred prominently in the Foxes run to the league title in 2016 before making a big money move to the Blues.

Ndidi was bought as a direct replacement to the French man and three seasons on, the 22-year-old has justified his fee.

The 22-year-old has slotted in perfectly into the Foxes midfield providing steel, guile and cover.

The Leicester midfielder made the top ten in-form players in a power-ranking stats released by whoscored.com on Monday.

Ndidi is rated fourth on the log with a performance rating stats of 7.84.
