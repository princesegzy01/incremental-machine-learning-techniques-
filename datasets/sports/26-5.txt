Daniel Akpeyi was once again the hero, saving two penalties as Kaizer Chiefs knocked out archrivals Orlando Pirates 4-2 on penalties in a Soweto derby in the Telkom Knockout on Saturday at the Moses Mabhida Stadium.

Fortune Makaringe scored the opener in the 35th minute for the visitors while Leonardo Castro scored his team’s equaliser in the 62nd minute as the game proceeded to extra time after 90 minutes of play.

Chiefs took the lead through Daniel Cardoso in the 94th minute but Gabadinho Mhango scored a 100th minute equaliser to take the game to penalty shootout.

Akpeyi, who saved a penalty in Chiefs round of 16 win over Cape Town City during the shootout, stood tall as he saved Pirates last two spot kicks to help his team to a famous 4-2 victory.

With the win, the Amakhosi are through to the semi-finals of the competition. Akpeyi has been Chiefs’ main shot stopper in the absence of the injured Itumeleng Khune.
