[Nigeria v Brazil] VIDEO: Joe Aribo’s goal
The Light Blues midfielder, Joe Aribo, who joined Gers after leaving Charlton, waltzed past Barcelona midfielder Arthur and PSG stopper Marquinos before firing past Man City keeper Ederson.

His strike came after 35 minutes of Sunday’s (today) friendly.

That makes it two goals in two games for Super Eagles new boy Aribo after his debut strike against Ukraine last month.

Brazil’s starting XI for today’s game also featured City ace Gabriel Jesus, Real Madrid’s Casemiro, PSG superstar Neymar and Liverpool hero Roberto Firmino.
