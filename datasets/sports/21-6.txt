Golden Eaglets hat-trick hero, Ibrahim Sai’d, has promised to win the U-17 World Cup trophy, saying he wants to make the country proud.

The Eaglets last won the trophy in 2015 in Chile beating Mali 2-0 in the final but Sai’d is already looking forward to lifting the trophy for the country for the sixth time but first they must overcome The Netherlands in the round of 16.

The Dutch pulled off a great comeback to reach the knockout stage having lost their first two matches in Brazil by a combined score of 6-1 before the European champions defeated USA 4-0 in their final group fixture to burst through.

The Eaglets on the other hand had to come back twice to win their first two matches before suffering a shock defeat to Australia to top Group.

“We want to bring this World Cup back to Nigeria,” Sai’d told FIFA.com.

The round of 16 match between Nigeria and The Netherlands will take place at Goiania’s Estadio Olimpico.
