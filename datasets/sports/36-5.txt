Nigeria recall Ahmed Musa for 2021 Africa Cup qualifiers
Nigeria recalled skipper Ahmed Musa, South Africa-based goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi and midfielder Mikel Agu on Monday for next month’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho.

The Super Eagles will open their qualifying campaign for the tournament in Cameroon on November 14 in the southern Nigerian city of Uyo and then travel to Lesotho three days later.

Musa, who plays for Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr, missed the recent friendly against five-time world champions Brazil in Singapore due to injury.

Akpeyi had been overlooked since the Africa Cup in Egypt after coach Gernot Rohr criticised the Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper for Algeria’s stoppage-time winner in the semi-final.
