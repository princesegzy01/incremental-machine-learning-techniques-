Eagles will play Brazil with caution – Ndidi
Ebenezer Bajela

Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, says the team will prevent their defence from being exposed while trying to score, when they face Brazil in their mouth-watering clash today.

According to the midfielder, the team has been studying how the Brazilians played against Senegal to map out how they can hurt the South Americans.

In an interview with Brila, monitored by our correspondent, the 22-year-old said they were ready to take on Tite’s men with caution.

“We are mindful of defending well against Tite’s men as much as we are with attacking,” he said.

“We watched the game between Brazil and Senegal, it was a good game and we have been preparing based on that, plus working on our shape.

“We have to find our solutions, while we’re trying to go deal with them, we are also mindful of our back.”
