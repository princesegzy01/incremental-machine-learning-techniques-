Sodiq Oyeleke

Teammates of dead footballers, Glory Saturday and Aniebet Ekong, have vowed to honour them with a promotion ticket.

The late duo were players of Police Machine FC of Uyo, amd were killed after being hit by a vehicle last Tuesday.

The team’s defender, Linda Nnaocha, said the deceased’s teammates were determined to honour their departed colleagues with a Premier League ticket.

“It’s been difficult for us no doubt. We went through a very hectic period following the death of Glory and Aniebet. It’s so unfortunate that this tragedy befell us but we just have to accept and move forward even though the pains of losing them has been unbearable,” she told thenwfl. com

“We promise to put in our best to make their dreams come to past. We know we have to play above ourselves to achieve this result, we will play for them and hopefully, we will fulfil our heart desires and those of our late colleagues.

“We appreciate the board of the NWFL for rescheduling the Pro-League and also honouring both players with a minute silence and a black armband during the NWPL relegation playoffs and am sure same will be done in Lokoja.”
