Jorginho, Kovacic need rest –Lampard
Chelsea manager Frank Lampard cannot wait to welcome N’Golo Kante back into the first team after injury as he admits that his midfielders need a rest.

Lampard was forced into picking Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic in the EFL Cup fourth round tie with Manchester United on Wednesday as the Blues struggle with a number of injuries in the middle of the park.

Jorginho has been an integral figure for Chelsea side this season, starting all 13 matches in the Premier League and Champions League, while Kovacic has appeared in all those 13 games.

Lampard was keen to give them the night off in the League Cup, especially with Ross Barkley and Ruben Loftus-Cheek still out, but his hand was forced.

“I would have liked to give Jorginho in particular and Kovacic a rest as well because of what they have been putting in, the endurance of the season, but I couldn’t because of N’Golo, Ross and Ruben out long-term.”
