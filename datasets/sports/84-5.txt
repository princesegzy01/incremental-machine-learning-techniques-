’Tosin Oluwalowo

South African Isabella Kruger’s run in the Lagos Open Tennis Championships ended, as she was knocked out of the second round on Thursday.

The 14-year old had caused the biggest upset of the tourney, when she defeated top seed, Valeriya Strakhova, in the first round on Wednesday, but she crashed to Holland’s Lexie Stevens 7-6, 6-3 a day later.

Stevens took the first set into tie break, before overcoming the South African 6-3 in the second set.

Kruger’s sister, Zoe, also lost her second round match 6-2 6-3 to Serbia’s Nastja Kolar.

In the quarter-final pairings, Burundi’s Sada Nahimana will play Stevens, while Kolar was paired with Sweden’s Fanny Ostlund.

Laura Pigossi from Brazil will also play Rutuja Bhosale from India, with fellow Indian, Riya Bhatia battling Egypt’s Sandra Samir.
