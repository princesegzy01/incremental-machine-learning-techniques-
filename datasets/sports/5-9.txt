Dele-Bashiru is with the Nigerian team in Egypt playing at the U-23 Africa Cup of Nations, after also representing the country at the 2019 U-20 World Cup in Poland.

He named former Eagles captains Austin Okocha and Nwankwo Kanu as his heroes.

“I’m very proud of my Nigerian roots,” he was quoted as saying on Watford’s website.

“It’s a great honour to play for my country and show everyone that Nigeria is a great breeding place for talents. It’s a massive country and we have massive support. Everyone there is a football fanatic, so the country will be behind us during this tournament. We have got to make them proud.

“Okocha is my hero. I just loved his playing style and watched videos of him all the time when I was growing up. He’s a big hero of mine, as is Kanu.”
