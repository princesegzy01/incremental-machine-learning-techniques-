Pochettino: I have Levy backing
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino insists he has the full support of chairman Daniel Levy.

Spurs have conceded 10 goals in heavy defeats to Bayern Munich and Brighton – and have now lost captain Hugo Lloris for the rest of the year with a dislocated elbow.

The Argentine signed a new five-year contract in May last year but the club’s current form – they were also knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Colchester – has cast doubt over his future in North London.

Speaking at the Aspire Global Summit in Qatar on Monday, Pochettino claimed recent results have not changed his close bond with chairman Levy.

“We maintain a very good relationship and it is extraordinary to have that support,” he said.

“I have always told him that in addition to my chairman, I consider him a friend.

“Football is not a drama, it is passion and we cannot separate it from emotions. But neither can we make a sport as fantastic as this one because of the latest result.

“We must learn from defeats to be able to exceed our limits and that begins by accepting that you don’t always win and that the opponent also works hard and makes merits. You must always react with dignity to the result, regardless of whether it is good or bad.”
