Lesotho captain Marepe Basia will miss Sunday’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria due to suspension, Sports Extra reports.

Basia was dismissed for a second yellow card in the 83rd minute as the Crocodiles drew 1-1 with Sierra Leone in Wednesday’s Group L fixture in Freetown.

He will also miss Lesotho’s match-day three and four clashes against Benin Republic.

Iceland-based Kwame Quee scored for Sierra Leone in an empty stadium in the 69th minute to give the hosts the lead before Lesotho leveled up through Jane Thabantso in the third minute of the added time.

In the same vein, Sierra Leone will be without George Kweku Davies when they face Nigeria on match-day three. Davies was shown a straight red for his retaliation to Basia.

Nigeria lead the table with three points, followed by Lesotho and Sierra Leone, who are both on one point in second and third place respectively, while Benin Republic occupies the bottom spot.
