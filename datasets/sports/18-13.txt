Super Eagles winger, Samuel Chukwueze, has rallied his mates to keep pushing after being held to a goalless draw by Basque side Atletico Bilbao on Sunday.

The draw was Villarreal’s third this season having won five and lost four in their opening 12 La Liga games.

Chukwueze who starred for 28 minutes in the clash, took to his Instagram handle on Tuesday to rally his teammates.

He wrote, “We keep pushing on,” with a fist emoji.

Chukwueze has played 11 times in the league, bagging two goals and two assists so far for the Stadio La Ceramica outfit.

Javi Calleja’s men needed to pick up from where they left off.

Villarreal are placed eighth in the La Liga standings with 18 points from 12 games.
