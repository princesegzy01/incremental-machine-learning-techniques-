Eagles attack okay, defence still faulty – Rohr

Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, says the national team needs to improve in the defence department.

He said this after Sunday’s international friendly match against Brazil in Singapore.

He added that the 1-1 draw against the Selecao was a good outing for the Eagles.

Rohr said, “It was tough for us as the second game because Brazil would not have wanted to leave Singapore without winning, and it feels very good to know that we can play so well against some of the biggest names in football.

“We didn’t have our best team here, but our wingers gave Brazil a lot of problems on the counter-attack and I am proud of our players. They can have a good future.

“We can still improve in defending set-pieces. We have height, with players as tall as two metres, but we have to be better in the air. It is not enough just to have good size, they need to jump well with good timing.”

Glasgow Rangers man Joe Aribo scored the opening goal in the 35th minute for the Nigerians, before Brazil’s Casemiro equalised in the second half.
