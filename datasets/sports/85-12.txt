Willock can replace Ramsey – Emery
Arsenal boss Unai Emery believes Joe Willock can fill the void left by Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere in their midfield.

The Gunners released Wilshere a year ago with the 27-year-old joining West Ham, while Ramsey also left on a free transfer when he moved to Juventus this summer.

“Willock started the pre-season with us last year, I didn’t give him more minutes but he was with us in every game, working in training, playing matches in the cup and at the end of the season,” said Emery.

“He deserved to start this season with the first-team and with us. My decision was after I saw him the last two months of last season working with us, his really big challenge was that Jack Wilshere left here, Aaron Ramsey left and he had to take that opportunity to be with us.

“The last months of last year was the moment I spoke with him and said: ‘For you it is a big challenge in the new season to do differently and really show us you can take their position in this squad.”
