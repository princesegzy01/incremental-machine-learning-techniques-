“African football is a bit difficult, Benin Republic are doing fine at the moment. I hope today’s (Tuesday) training will be enough for us.”

According to Musa, the players have resolved to ensure that Nigeria grab three points in their match against Benin

He said, “We don’t have a choice. We have to play. Our last two games were good. We will only put our attention in this game the way we did in the friendlies.

“We all know that we have to win the first game. We all know that this is important. We’ll talk to ourselves to ensure that we go out to show what we have.”

Benin coach Michel Dussuyer, said his team were eyeing a positive result in Uyo.

He said, “We know here are great African champions, third in the last AFCON. They have a large squad with players who play at the highest level. We know the gaps in potential.

“We’re here to defend our chances on the field, if we’re disciplined. We already have some experience of playing for the big teams. We’re going to play a game with ambitions.”
