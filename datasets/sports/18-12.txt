Etebo set to return against Barnsley

Oghenekaro Etebo could return to action Stoke City when the Potters face Barnsley in an English Championship clash at the Bet365 stadium on Saturday.

Etebo copped a thigh muscle injury in Stoke’s 1-0 loss to Sheffield Wednesday a fortnight ago and missed his side’s clash against Millwall and West Brom.

But after additional tests were carried out on Etebo, a report on Stoke Sentinel confirmed that the Nigeria international could be back in the squad on Thursday as the Potters seek their third win of the campaign.

The 23-year-old Etebo cost the Potters £6.3m from Feirense in the summer of 2018 and has only been able to start eight out of Stoke’s 14 Championship matches to date.

However, he has been one of the outstanding performers in a struggling team and was sorely missed in the defeat at Millwall that ultimately cost Nathan Jones his job last week.

Stoke are bottom of the Championship table with eight points from 15 games.

He has been listed as a standby player for Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Benin Republic and Lesotho next week.
