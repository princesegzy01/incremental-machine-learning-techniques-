Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa has expressed his delight at returning from injury layoff after featuring for seven minutes for his Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr in their 4-0 home win over Abha at the King Faisal bin Fahd Stadium on Saturday.

Musa has been out of action for two months with injury.

The Eagles captain picked up a knee injury in Al Nassr’s clash away to Al Fateh FC on August 30 and has not featured for the Eagles since the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, where Nigeria won a bronze medal.

He has missed the friendly matches against Ukraine on September 10 and Brazil on October 13.

Taking to social media after making a cameo appearance on Saturday, Musa thanked everyone for their support while he was injured.

“It’s so good to be back to the game I love and to make it a lot more special is the great outpour of love and prayers I got from my family, friends, supporters and all the fans of Al Nassr FC.

“Special thanks to the medical team, teammates and the entire management for standing by me,” he wrote on Twitter.

Musa is one of the four players recalled by coach Gernot Rohr for the AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho.
