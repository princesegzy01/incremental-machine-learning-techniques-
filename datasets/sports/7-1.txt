Wenger: Pep will be devastated
Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says Liverpool are set to runaway with the Premier League title.

Wenger believes that the writing is on the wall as he cannot see Liverpool conceding their significant advantage, stating the deficit is too large for Manchester City to make up.

“First of all, to lose a big game, it is terrible and you can see the reactions from both managers (last night), how much pressure they are under and how much a game like that means,” he told BeIN Sports after Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat of City on Sunday.

“(Pep) Guardiola will go home and be absolutely devastated, more than you think. If you think of a quantity, add 100% to that.

“Overall, nine points is too big a difference for Man City after 12 games.”
