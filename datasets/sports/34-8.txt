Missing IAAF money: ICPC reschedules Adeleye’s interrogation
Sodiq Oyeleke

Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission has rescheduled the interrogation of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria’s Technical Director, Sunday Adeleye, on issues bordering on how IAAF’s $130,000 was spent.

Our correspondent gathered that the anti-graft agency has rescheduled the grilling of Adeleye for Friday.

When asked if Adeleye honoured the invitation on Wednesday, an ICPC official said, “No, his appointment has been rescheduled for Friday.”

The ICPC had in a letter of invitation marked ICPC/INV/NGB/T.AFI/103 ordered Adeleye to appear at its headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday.

The letter signed by ICPC’s Acting Head of Investigation Department, Hassan Mohammed, instructed Adeleye to “come along with certified true copies of all the expenditure and retirement made in respect of the 2017 Confederation of Africa Athletics Grand Prix/Warri Relay, which held in Ozoro, Delta State on July 18, 2017.”

The ICPC is currently investigating alleged misappropriation of IAAF’s $130, 000. The excess money was paid mistakenly into the AFN account as grant.

Before inviting Adeleye, the ICPC had interrogated the former Secretary-General of the AFN, Amaechi Akawu.
