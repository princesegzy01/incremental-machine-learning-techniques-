A footballer, Yakubu Hassan, has been suspended indefinitely for allegedly slapping a referee, Kasimu Ahmadu, during a match in Lafia, the capital of Nasarawa State.

Hassan, who was suspended by the Nasarawa Football Association, plays for a local team in the state, Dubagari FC.

Vice Chairman of Nasarawa FA, Halidu Akwashiki, said Hassan slapped the referee on October 29 when his team played against Winda Force in the Nasarawa FA 2019/20 Premier League, which has 30 local teams participating.

Akwashiki explained that the player was cautioned for an infringement when he subsequently slapped the referee.

Akwashiki, who is also the chairman of the competition’s disciplinary committee, said, “Aside the suspension, the player was directed to write an apology letter to the match officials and his club to pay a fine to the FA.

“The action we took will serve as lessons to other players and clubs never to intimidate or instigate violence on match officials and to adhere strictly to the rules of the game.”

Secretary General of Nasarawa Referees Council, Mohammed Isa, canvassed stiffer punishment for any player, who violently attacked referees in the course of carrying out their duties on the field of play.

Isa told NAN that the referee council has decided that none of its officials would officiate any fixture with the player, who slapped one of their members, involved.

“I want to assure you that the player will never participate in any competition within this state again and if he is participating, the referees in the state shall not participate; that is our stand,” he added.
