Akpeyi needs confidence to flourish with Eagles – Shorunmu

Former Super Eagles goalkeeper Ike Shorunmu has urged Daniel Akpeyi to believe in himself and build confidence when he plays for the national team in order to give a good performance.

Akpeyi has been recalled back to the Eagles for 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Benin Republic on November 13 and Lesotho four days later.

He last featured for the Eagles in the semi-final loss to Algeria at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt where he posted nervy performances and struggled to impress despite his wealth of experience in the team.

In a chat with Sports Extra, Shorunmu admits that the Kaizer Chief shot-stopper is a good goalkeeper, but has not been convincing for the national team because of his confidence.

“When you talk of his present form, he (Akpeyi) is doing well, but when he comes to the national team, can he be accepted,” Shorunmu told Sports Extra.

“The national team is different from the club assignment.

“I have been there before and I have trained with a lot of players and goalkeepers when you see the way they perform in their clubs and in the national team, it is something else entirely.

“I just believe right now, Akpeyi is doing well in his club, it now depends on how much confidence the coach has in him.

“It is a two-way thing. Before the World Cup, he was playing well, before they invited him to the national team.

“My little problem with Akpeyi is that he does not show the confidence that can earn him the No.1 because I have worked with him before, I have spoken with him several times. Sometimes, when he comes to the national team, it’s like he is not sure of himself.”
