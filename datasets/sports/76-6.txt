The Super Eagles stock is currently on the bounce, making the top 20 of the world’s most valuable national teams based on the latest reports by transfermarket.

The Super Eagles are currently Africa’s third best team and 34th in the world, following impressive displays in their two recent international friendlies against Ukraine and Brazil, which ended in stalemates.

According to stats and permutations based on each national team players’ stocks, the combined value of the current Super Eagles squad is set at €219m.

The commercial value means the Eagles are ranked 19th, eight places behind fellow West African neighbours, Senegal, who are ranked 11th with a market value of €418m.

Current world champions, France, are number one valued at €1.23bn with England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Italy, Argentina, Portugal, Netherlands and Brazil completing the top 10.
