Break bank to buy Mbappe, Saha tells United
Manchester United need to ‘break the bank’ and sign Kylian Mbappe to revive their flagging attack, says former Old Trafford favourite Louis Saha.

United have struggled so far this season, particularly in attack and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have rarely looked a threat in front of goal.

Saha thinks that elite strikers are a dying breed so the the club should try and recruit PSG’s lethal frontman.

He told Compare.Bet,“If you ask me, I would break the bank for Mbappe, but now it’s too late.

“But, when you look at strikers, it’s a dying breed. Lewandowski is a rare example of someone who is left, and I don’t see many players that can easily fit up front.

“There is a need for somebody up front who is strong enough to hold the ball and to give time and space to the players like Paul Pogba and McTominay to create something in midfield to put passes together.

“You’re asking a lot from young players because passing the ball around and having nice touches, it just looks too nice and it doesn’t work.”
