Chelsea breached 150 FIFA rules with 71 players
CHELSEA received their Fifa transfer ban because they failed to register overseas minors over multiple seasons.

It has now emerged Fifa found Chelsea guilty of a total of 150 breaches of rules, involving 71 players.

The Blues are still awaiting a date for their appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport where they hope to get the green light to spend again in January.

But now Fifa have released the full findings of Chelsea’s failed appeal against the two-window ban imposed in February.

And the finding show that Fifa simply dismissed many of the club’s arguments by pointing to the sheer number of youth games played by some of the players.

One player, who is unnamed, was said to have played 75 games for the club between 2013 and 2016, despite only being registered as a trialist over three six-week periods.

Burkina Faso attacker Bertrand Traore – who moved to London from his homeland and was sent to the £20,000-per-year Whitgift School in Croydon – played for the club for three years before being registered in 2014.

One child, 13 when he first came to England, played 55 games for the club while other teenagers also spent elongated spells as unregistered Chelsea players, some playing more than 20 matches.
