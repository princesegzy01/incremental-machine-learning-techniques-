West Ham defender, Angelo Ogbonna, has explained that he opted to play for Italy rather than Nigeria because it was the right thing to do for him.

Ogbonna an Italian of Nigerian descent has been capped 13 times by the Azzuri and has represented the Nazionale at two major tournaments.

The Hammers defender in an interview with the club’s official website, Ogbonna said, “I grew up with Nigerian parents, but I chose to play for the Italian national team because I felt that was right.

“Whether you are black, Asian or whatever, you should be proud. I always say we should be focused on the important things, which are not black or white. We are the same people. We all laugh and we all cry. For me, there is no difference.”

Ogbonna who still cherishes his Nigerian roots also added, “Of course, African culture and Italian culture are different, when you compare them.

“And then you have Nigerian culture and English culture, which are different but related because Nigeria used to be a British colony.”
