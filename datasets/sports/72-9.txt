The League Management Company has announced November 3 as the new kick-off date for the 2019/2020 Nigeria Professional Football League season.

This is as the Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, earlier hinted that the league would start on October 20.

However, a statement on Tuesday noted that the new date – November 3 – was picked after the draw for the competition was held.

The draw was supervised by the LMC chairman, Shehu Dikko, and the company’s Chief Operating Officer, Salihu Abubakar.

The statement read, “The new date is being backed by the conduct of the draw for the competition, held late on Monday in Abuja.

“The league will revert to its original format of 20 clubs represented in a single NPFL log. During the course of the season, which will run from November to May, each club will play in a double round-robin system.

“They will face each other once at their home stadium and once at that of each of their opponents, for 38 games each.

“After a long consultative meeting which began at 6 pm and ended at 12 midnight, it was also agreed that the long-awaited season will now kick off on November 3. It is expected to end on May 30, 2020.”

In the match day one fixtures, Wikki Tourists play Jigawa Stars, Plateau United battle Lobi Stars, Delta Force take on Akwa Starlets, while last season’s runners-up Kano Pillars engage Rivers United.

The other fixtures have Heartland versus MFM, IfeanyiUbah versus Adamawa United, Enugu Rangers versus Sunshine Stars, Warri Wolves versus Akwa United, Abia Warriors versus Katsina United and Enyimba versus Nasarawa United.
