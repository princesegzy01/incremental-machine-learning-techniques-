Golf: Okoko wins AWA Championship
Godwin Okoko of Otukpo Golf Club, Benue State, emerged winner at the sixth AWA Ibraheem Junior Golf Championship at the weekend.

Okoko, 15, edged defending champion and club mate John Alex in the second play-off hole after the two players were tied after 54 holes with gross score of 233 at the Ikeja Golf Club in Lagos.

“I am very glad that these young golfers can face this level of competition and pull off these beautiful performances, which is the essence of this event,” AWA Ibraheem, sponsor of the event, said at the closing ceremony.

Okoko is expected to make a bold leap on the World Amateur Golf Ranking, since the event was locked in by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in Scotland as a point-awarding event.

And as with the tradition of the event, over 20 winners at the championship were awarded scholarships to encourage them to stay back in school.
