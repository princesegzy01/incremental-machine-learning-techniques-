Aalesund have reportedly opened talks with Meizhou Hakka – a second division club in China – over a permanent deal for midfielder Izunna Uzochukwu, Sports Extra.

Uzochukwu is currently approaching the end of a season-long loan at Aalesund, where he has established himself as an important part of Lars Bohinen’s squad that recently gained promotion back to the elite division with a game to spare.

The 29-year-old has established himself as a key member of Aalesund’s midfield since joining from Meizhou Hakka at the start of the season, winning the PFA Player of the month twice before his copping an injury which he is recuperating from.

“It has been a good season for me because what I set out to achieve with the club happened,” Uzochukwu told Sports Extra.

“We have gained promotion back to the topflight division and talks have begun with the club over a permanent deal which in the coming days, which an agreement will be reached.

The Standard reports that Aalesund have moved quickly to begin negotiations over making the loan deal permanent in order to beat competition from Valenrenga and Tromso, who have also been credited with an interest.

Uzochukwu has made 17 appearances for Aalesund across all competitions so far this season, 13 of which have been as a starter before his injury setback.
