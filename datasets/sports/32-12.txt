Rashford: Confidence levels have soared at United
Marcus Rashford says confidence is growing in the Manchester United ranks following a third consecutive away win.

United, who had not tasted victory on the road since March prior to last Thursday’s win against Partizan in Belgrade, are suddenly enjoying their best run of form this season.

They followed up Sunday’s 3-1 win at Norwich by beating Chelsea 2-1 at Stamford Bridge to reach the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup, where they will host League Two Colchester.

Rashford put them ahead from the penalty spot and then, after Michy Batshuayi equalised, he celebrated his 22nd birthday with a stunning 30-yard free-kick.

The England striker told Sky Sports,“If you get a couple of wins back-to-back early on in the season it can change the direction the season is going.

“Because mentally, for a team like Man United, when you’re winning back-to-back games, the team’s confidence levels go up.

“So, if we can keep doing this and keep it up in the league, we take it game by game and go back up the table.”
