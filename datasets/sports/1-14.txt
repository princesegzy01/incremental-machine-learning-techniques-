FIFA Secretary-General and General Delegate for Africa, Fatma Samoura, has advised the participants at CAF’s first ever Women’s Football Taskforce Workshop on how they could develop women’s football in Africa.

She said this at the workshop closing ceremony on Thursday.

Addressing the participants, she praised the exchanges and presentations that had taken place over the two-day event, as well as the excellent ideas and momentum the workshop generated.

Samoura said, “Don’t keep what you have discussed and learned over the last two days to yourself! Make sure it will benefit your country and tell your national federations about it.”

She said CAF’s first-ever strategy for women’s football would provide a clear road map to nurture the women’s game and allow it flourish, while simultaneously addressing the needs of CAF’s 54-Member Associations throughout Africa.

She also shared her experiences working for the United Nations and FIFA with the group, stressing that developing women’s football and empowering women in football has been of paramount importance to her since she took up her role at FIFA in 2016.
