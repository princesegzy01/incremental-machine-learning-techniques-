Ahead of their round of 16 U-17 World Cup clash against The Netherlands on Wednesday, Golden Eaglets players are confident they will book a quarter-final slot.

The Eaglets are favourites to pick the quarter-final ticket after finishing top of Group B while Holland qualified as one of the best four losers.

Forward, Olakunle Olusegun, insists that the team will beat their European opponent, promising that they were ready to take their chances in front of goal.

“I know we are going to do very well because we are a strong side, we‘ve learnt a lot from our last training exercise and I’m sure the result will show. All the chances we are going to create, I’m sure we are going to convert them and also our defence, I’m sure they are going to mark the opponents out.”

However, Eaglets striker, Peter Olawale, has called for caution when they face the Oranje.

“For me I think the game will not be easy. Because they are a strong side too despite the position they finished in their group. I want us to play as a team and I know if we play with unity we will progress to the next round.”

Midfielder, Peter Agba, believes the Eaglets are unstoppable and are not scared of the Dutch side.

“The game will be a good one, I think we are unstoppable if we play as a team, we have been given the instruction, our job is to go out and execute it now. The team is a very talented one and I’m sure that with togetherness, we will come out victorious.

“I trust everyone on the field and those on the bench will also be cheering the team. We don’t care about their pedigree, we are Nigeria and we want to take the trophy back home,” he concluded.
