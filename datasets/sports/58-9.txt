City not ready to win Champions League –Guardiola
Manchester City have dominated English football since Pep Guardiola arrived three years ago.

After settling in during the 2016/17 season, the Spanish manager has since led the club to back-to-back Premier League titles.

He also delivered a domestic treble at the end of the last campaign, winning the League Cup and FA Cup alongside the title.

Although winning the Premier League three years in a row would be an incredible achievement, success in the Champions League seems to be the priority for Man City this year.

Even under Guardiola, they’ve come up short in recent years and haven’t gone any further than the quarter-finals.

So will this finally be their season? Well, according to the boss himself, no.

Following Saturday’s 2-0 win away to Crystal Palace, Pep claimed that City still aren’t ready to win the Champions League.

“The people say about the Champions League, that target. We still are not ready,” he said.
