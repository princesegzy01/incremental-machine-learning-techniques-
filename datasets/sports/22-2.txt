Super Eagles defenders Kenneth Omeruo and Chidozie Awaziem have a new manager at their Spanish La Liga clubside Leganes.

The club on Monday announced the appointment of former Egypt coach Javier Aguirre as their new manager.

His appointment was announced via a statement released by the club on its website.

“CD. Leganés and Mexican coach Javier Aguirre Onaindia reached an agreement for the Aztec coach to take charge of the pepineros’ bench until the end of the season.

“Aguirre, 60, has a long career, having directed more than 350 games in the First Division. Luis Cembranos will continue directing the second team,” the statement read in part.

Aguirre’s appointment followed the sack of Mauricio Pellegrino as Leganes manager on October 21.

Leganes are last on the La liga table with only one win in 12 league appearances.

Aguirre coached Egypt at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, hosted by them.

He was however sacked after their dismal performance, where they were knocked out by South Africa in the Round of 16.
