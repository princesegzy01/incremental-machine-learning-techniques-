Sodiq Oyeleke

The Tillers of University of Agriculture, Makurdi and University of Calabar’s Malabites have qualified for the final of the 2019 Higher Institutions Football League Super 4.

The 2018 champions UAM Tillers and runners-up, UNICAL Malabites both cruised past Obafemi Awolowo University’s Giants and University of Ilorin’s Warriors respectively, to book their place in the final.

UNILORIN Warriors will now play OAU Giants in the third place match that will be played alongside the final on October 26 at the Agege Township Stadium in Lagos.

Toraza Terungwa was the hero for the resurgent Tillers as he saved three straight penalties, to give his side a 3-0 shoot-out win in front of a roaring home crowd. The game ended 1-1 at regular time.

OAU Tillers were first to score in the 46th minute as tough defender Faleti Ayo brilliantly headed home a cross. However, Tony Eliagwu rescued the home team with a 57th minute leveller.

It is the second time the Tillers will qualify ahead of OAU Giants, after the Giants suffered similar fate in the 2018 semi-finals stage.

Elsewhere in Rivers State, UNICAL Malabite’s Odey Santos scored twice in the 45th and 90th minute to send the Malabite’s into the finals with a 2-0 win against UNILORIN Warriors.
