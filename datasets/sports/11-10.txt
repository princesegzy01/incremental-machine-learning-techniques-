Nigeria’s women basketball team, D’Tigress, have moved three places up and are now 16th best team in the world and first in Africa in the latest women’s ranking released by FIBA on Friday.

The latest movement makes Nigeria the only African country to make the top 20.

African champions D’Tigress garnered 329.2 points to place 16th and first in Africa.

World champions and Olympic gold medalists, USA, maintained their top-ranked spot with 835.6 points, Australia are in second place with 714.1 points, Spain third with 692.7, Canada fourth with 641.9 and France a close fifth with 639.3 points.

The Afrobasket champions would hope to grab one of the two Olympic slots at the Africa Pre-Qualifying Tournament for Tokyo2020 in Mozambique from November 14 to 17.

FIBA announced on their website that with the new women’s competition system starting this month with the FIBA Women’s Olympic Pre-Qualifying Tournaments in Africa, the Americas and Asia, it has launched the new system for the FIBA World Ranking Women, presented by Nike.

Moving from a competition-based system to a game-based one, the new ranking is based on results of games ranging from regional pre-qualifiers all the way to the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup Final, including the Olympics as well as FIBA Continental Cups. The previous ranking was purely competition-based and only considered the final standings of tournaments.
