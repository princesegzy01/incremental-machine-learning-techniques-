Super Eagles midfielder, Ogenekaro Etebo, has a new manager at the English Championship club.

Stoke sacked manager Nathan Jones on November 1 following a disastrous start to the season that has left the club second bottom of the Championship after losing 10 of their 14 league matches this season.

The club on Friday November 8 announced the appointment of Michael O’Neil as their new manager.

The Potters confirmed the appointment of Michael O’Neill as the club’s new manager on a three-and-a-half-year deal.

The Championship strugglers, have won just twice in the league this season and currently lie bottom of the Championship.

That poor of form cost Jones who left Luton for the Bet365 Stadium in January his job.

O’Neill, who had a hugely successful eight-year stint with Northern Ireland, has been tasked with resurrecting the alarming slump.

The 50-year-old, who led Northern Ireland to their first major tournament in 30 years by securing qualification for Euro 2016, will take charge of the Potters at Barnsley on Saturday.
