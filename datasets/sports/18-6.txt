The Nigeria Football Federation has claimed that its officials were being victimised with allegations of corruption.

The NFF said this in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Ademola Olajire, on Tuesday.

The Federal Government on Tuesday withdrew its corruption charges against five officials of the NFF.

They are NFF president, Amaju Pinnick, NFF secretary-general, Sunusi Mohammed; the 1st vice president, Seyi Akinwumi; the 2nd vice president, Shehu Dikko and an executive member, Yusuff Fresh.

They were arraigned in May on 18 counts charges, including alleged misappropriation of the sums of $8.4m and N4bn belonging to the NFF.

NFF in a statement said, “This is a confirmation of the position of the NFF on all swirling allegations of corruption against its officials. Nigeria’s supreme football-governing body has always insisted that its leaders were being victimised by persons who lost elections through the ballot and were seeking other means to upturn things at the Glass House, or disgruntled individuals simply on a mission of vendetta.

“Only last month, a motion by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to remove the names of Pinnick and Sanusi from the witnesses’ category and add them to the list of accused persons in a case at the FCT High Court over the same $8.4m FIFA grant was put on hold after the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation submitted that it was taking over the case with a view to ascertaining its validity, seeing that same persons were being charged spuriously in different courts and/or investigated by several agencies over the same allegations hewed out of petitions by the same individuals. “
