Bent: Iwobi not good for No.10 role
‘Tosin Oluwalowo

Former England international, Darren Bent, has said Alex Iwobi lacks the quality to play in the No. 10 role for Premier League side Everton.

Speaking to Football Insider, Bent said Iwobi, who played the No. 10 role in the 2-0 win over West Ham on Saturday, picked the wrong options many times while with the ball.

The former Three Lions forward further said he preferred Iceland captain Gylfi Sigurdsson, who replaced Iwobi in the 87th minute for the role.

He said, “Any player would want him in their team as he works so hard but my only issue with him is that if you’re going to play that No.10 role you need to have better quality on the ball and for me, too many times, he’ll pick the wrong option as he’ll shoot rather than pass or overshoot his pass, so if you’re going to play a No.10 it needs to be someone like Sigurdsson.

“He’s got that kind of technique, which he showed with the second goal, that means he can play No.10, he is a manager’s dream as he works really hard but to play No.10, you need to have more quality.”

Iwobi joined Everton from Arsenal on transfer day deadline for £34m.

He has scored two goals and created one assist in nine appearances for the Toffees.
