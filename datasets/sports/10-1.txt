Lille’s hit-man, Victor Osimhen, fancies a switch to the La Liga but, remains committed to Les Dogues and won’t demand an exit.

The Super Eagles striker has been a revelation in Ligue 1 since completing a €12m switch from Belgian outfit, Sporting Charleroi this season.

Osimhen’s fantastic start to life in France was highlighted by his scooping of the Ligue 1 Player of the Month award for October.

The 20-year-old has scored seven Ligue 1 goals in 12 appearances for the Lille based outfit.

In Europe, after a seven year absence from the Champions League, the Nigeria international for Lille also got on the score sheet twice; against Chelsea at home and Valencia away respectively.

Aware of his rising stock, Osimhen admits a switch to Spain would be a dream, but, added his staying or leaving will be determined by the club directors.

“I have always been ready to go through the stages, but I am in Lille. I love people. If big clubs look at me, it’s great for me, but it’s the club that will decide if I stay or leave. I will not object. (…) I am a big fan of La Liga since I was small. It’s my dream to play there,” he told L’Equipe.
