Omonia Nicosia’s Nigeria goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, will miss four weeks of action through injury.

The 21-year-old damaged his external knee ligament and meniscus while in action for the Super Eagles in their 1-1 draw with Brazil in Singapore and is a doubt for Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Nations Cup qualifiers against Benin Republic on November 11.

“The injury to Francis is not too serious but he will be out of action a minimum three to four weeks,” Eagles coach Gernot Rohr said.

“Francis had a great game, we regret his injury. He will have examinations tomorrow (today).

“Maduka (Okoye) did well when he came on for him and could continue for the next game.”

Uzoho will miss Omonia Nicosia’s next five league games (against Anthorsis Famagusta, Olympiakos, Ethnikos Achna AEL Limassol, and Paralimni).

Nigeria are drawn in Group L of the 2021 Africa Nations Cup qualifiers against Sierra Leone, Lesotho, and Benin Republic.
