Pepe happy with Emery’s trust
Nicolas Pepe admits he has struggled to live up to the high expectations of becoming Arsenal’s record signing but praised head coach Unai Emery for trusting in his ability.

The Ivory Coast international moved to the Emirates Stadium from Lille for £72m in the summer but initially failed to justify that hefty price tag during a difficult start to life in England.

That all changed on Thursday night, however, as he came off the bench to score two free-kicks and secure the Gunners a 3-2 Europa League win over Vitoria.

The Portuguese side looked on course for a shock win at the Emirates Stadium before Pepe twice bent home inch-perfect set-pieces, the second of which came in stoppage time.

The result eases the pressure on both Pepe and Emery – who has come in for criticism for his tactics and team selection in recent weeks, especially after a 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United on Monday.

But the 24-year-old revealed the faith Emery has shown in him has been key in his adaptation to Premier League football.

“The manager trusts me,” he said.

“Even if I hadn’t been decisive for a while, I always had the manager’s trust. It is always important to have the manager’s faith.”
