English League Cup: Man United beat Chelsea 2-1
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was rewarded for naming a strong team as United beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, in the English League Cup match to continue their recent revival.

Solskjaer made just four changes, while Chelsea boss Frank Lampard made six and it was five-time League Cup winners United who came out on top as they enjoyed a third successive victory.

After Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial both missed penalties in United’s win at Norwich on Sunday, Solskjaer’s team went in front thanks to a successful spot-kick in the 26th minute at the Bridge.

Daniel James was fouled by Marcos Alonso and Rashford stepped up to send Willy Caballero the wrong way from the spot for his sixth goal of the season.

Michy Batshuayi equalised from long-range in the 61st minute, but Rashford’s superb 30-yard free-kick won it for United in the 73rd minute.

Aston Villa moved into the last eight with a 2-1 win over local rivals Wolves.
