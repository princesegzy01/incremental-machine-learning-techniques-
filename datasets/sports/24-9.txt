We withdrew from NNL to avoid bloodshed – 36 Lion
Sodiq Oyeleke

A Lagos-based football club, 36 Lion, say withdrawing from the Nigeria National League for at least two seasons was to prevent bloodshed during matches.

The Chief Operating Officer and Chairman of the club, Kazeem Omotosho, made this known in a letter addressed to the Lagos State Football Association, Nigeria Football Federation, Lagos State Sports Commission and Nigeria National League.

In a copy of the letter obtained on by our correspondent on Sunday, Omotosho alleged that unfair officiating and interference were brewing violence among fans.

The letter read in part, “We struggle to survive and stay afloat last season –2018/2019. Mistake calls from referees that officiated our matches both home and away were rampant and flagrant. The most significant, which nearly caused mayhem on June 30 at Agege Stadium, was our week 10 match against Stationery Stores of Lagos.

“There has also been a vow by our supporters that referees who come and cheat us this coming season will not leave the stadium unhurt. The emotional trauma for our players and officials are also immeasurable.

“We can control our players and officials but our fans have proven very difficult. We’ve had meetings with our various supporters club coordinators in Lagos Island, Surulere (Shitta precisely), Mushin, Oshodi, Agege, Ikorodu and Badagry which yielded nothing positive.

“In view of the above and to avoid a possible bloodshed in our stadium, we won’t be participating in this upcoming season or maybe two more seasons to come until the baton in the day-to-day activities of Lagos State Football changes hand.”
