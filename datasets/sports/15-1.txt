Conte blasts Inter directors over poor planning
Inter Milan coach Antonio Conte has lambasted the directors of his club for poor planning after seeing his team squander a two-goal half-time lead and lost 3-2 to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.

Conte repeated his complaint that his squad is too thin and players too inexperienced to battle on two fronts and suggested that club directors should face the television cameras as well as himself.

“Some important mistakes have been made at the planning stage, we can’t play both the Champions League and Serie A with such a small squad,” Conte said after Tuesday’s match.

“I’m tired of saying the same things over and over again, perhaps they could come here over and say something. I hope that this will help them understand a few things.”

“They tell me that I should smile more on television,” he added. “But I always end up saying the same things, about the growth process, about taking it step by step.

“The lads are giving everything and going at full pelt and I can’t ask them for more than that,” he said.

“We are talking about players who, apart from Diego Godin, have never won anything. Who do we turn to? Nicolo Barella who has come from Cagliari? Or [Stefano] Sensi, who came from Sassuolo?”

His comments are likely to raise eyebrows as Inter spent more than €150 million on new signings during the transfer window.

Chinese-owned Inter, who have not won any major silverware since 2011, are second in Serie A, one point behind leaders Juventus. Tuesday’s defeat left them third in Champions League Group F, three points behind Borussia Dortmund.

“We need to keep a low profile,” Conte added. “Our position in Serie A should not allow us to forget our problems.”
