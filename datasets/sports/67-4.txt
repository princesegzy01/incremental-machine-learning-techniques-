Okereke keen to maintain form

Club Brugge attacker, David Okereke, is hoping to return to his impressive goal-scoring form for the Blue White.

Philip Clément’s charges are currently at the summit and are not far-off in Europe as their two points in two matches against Galatasaray at home and Real at the Bernabeau means that the capital-based outfit, currently occupying second spot can still create an upset and sneak out of group A.

And the 22-year-old, who missed out on the Super Eagles’ recent international friendlies against Ukraine and Brazil, told Sports Extra sustaining his form as the league campaign intensifies is important to him.

“The team is working hard as usual. It is important to maintain form especially when active football resumes after the international break. I’m just keeping my focus, and ensuring I help the club domestically and in Europe. The season is long and the intensity can step up but, I hope to sustain my goal-scoring form,” he stated.

Okereke has played 10 times for Brugge, scoring four goals so far this season.
