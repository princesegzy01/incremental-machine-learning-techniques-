Dare relocates office to Abuja National Stadium
The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has relocated his office to the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja.

The move, made on Monday, is in line with the minister’s promise to ensure that the nation’s sports facilities become hubs of activities and fully functional.

During an interactive session with the Press Unit of the ministry, Dare asserted that the Youth and Sports Ministry was a critical artery to Nigeria’s human capital development, adding that 13 ministries had youth development as part of their budgets and mandate.

The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, according to him, will leverage on this pivotal advantage expressed in the National Youth Policy for Social Economic Empowerment of youths.

Furthermore, the minister emphasised the importance of communication to youth and sports development, stressing that the Press Unit of the ministry should increase its ante professionally, by narrating its story timely and accurately with authentic and approved facts before disseminating to the Nigerian public.
