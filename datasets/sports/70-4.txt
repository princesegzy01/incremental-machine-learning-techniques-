Oba of Benin to unveil cultural golf wear
Johnny Edward

The Director-General of the National Council of Arts and Culture, Olusegun Runsewe, says a new cultural golf wear will be launched by the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare 11 on October 26.

The event will take place at the closing ceremony of the National Cultural Festival in Benin, Edo State, according to Runsewe.

“When others agonise over ideas, self doubt has never crossed my mind,” Runsewe told a media conference.

“I only viewed the Nigerian golf and quickly knew it by heart that it was huge enough to have its own identity. This is reason I could delve into this venture and I can assure you that in another two years, these wears would be established in golf circles across the country and elsewhere around the world.

“The good thing about this project is that it will leave behind a bold statement that Nigeria as a nation is culturally endowed.”
