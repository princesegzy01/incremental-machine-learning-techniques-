We’re prepared for ‘wounded Nigerians’ – Zambia
Sodiq Oyeleke

Zambia’s U-23 team coach, Beston Chambeshi, says Nigeria are wounded after their 1-0 loss to Ivory Coast in their Group B opener on Saturday.

Nigeria and Zambia lock horns in their match day two game at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo on Tuesday (today).

Speaking ahead of the clash, Chambeshi told CAF website, “Nigeria are like a wounded lion, it will not be an easy match.”

Zambia managed a goalless draw in their opener against neighbours South Africa.

A win over holders Nigeria will give them a huge boost before taking on Ivory Coast in the final group game on Friday.
