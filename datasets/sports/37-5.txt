Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, is generating more interest from clubs across Europe, with German giants Bayern Munich and AC Milan the latest clubs linked with a move for him.

This comes after reported interests in the striker by Barcelona, Manchester United and Newcastle United.

According to a report on a French website, soccerlink.fr, the 20-year-old Nigeria international is seen as an ideal replacement for Robert Lewandowski, who is being courted by Real Madrid.

“The Bavarian club have sent scouts several times since the beginning of the season to watch the Nigerian striker,”soccerlink.fr reports.

Should Osimhen signs for Bayern, it will see him return to the German Bundesliga, after spending the 2017/18 season at Wolfsburg, where he failed to make his mark before moving to Sporting Charleroi on loan in 2018.

Osimhen has been in blistering form since moving to Lille for €12m from Charleroi. He has scored eight goals in 14 games for Lille.
