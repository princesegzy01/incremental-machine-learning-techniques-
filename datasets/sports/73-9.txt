Ligue 1 Most Prolific Player: Slimani rated ahead of Osimhen
Johnny Edward

Monaco’s lanky striker, Islam Slimani, has been rated French Ligue 1’s most prolific player ahead of Victor Osimhen, despite scoring less goals than the Nigerian, Sports Extra reports.

Slimani joined Monaco on a season loan deal from Leicester City in the summer and has been directly involved in 10 (four goals and six assist) of AS Monaco’s 15 goals despite having featured in just six of their nine matches.

Osimhen on his part has had a hand in nine (seven goals and two assists) of Lille’s 13 goals scored so far this term.

The Nigeria international has one more than Pepe at this time last year and has topped the scoring chart since Week 6.

Osimhen has been on fire at Stade Pierre-Mauroy this season where he scored all his goals.

The 31-year-old Algerian international, an AFCON winner in the summer, leads Osimhen in terms of goals and assists together.

Both players are also in the running for the September Ligue 1 Player of The Month award alongside Nantes’ Nicolas Pallois.

Meanwhile, Osimhen could set a new goalscoring record should he score against Toulouse on Saturday.

The former Sporting Charleroi striker equaled Radamel Falcao’s 2013 scoring feat, hittiong seven goals in his first nine Ligue 1 games last weekend.
