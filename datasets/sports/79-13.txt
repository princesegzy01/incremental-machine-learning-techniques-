Super Eagles forward, Henry Onyekuru, has agreed a deal in principle to join Turkish champions Galatasaray on a six-month loan deal in January, Sports Extra reports.

The forward has struggled to replicate the form that saw Monaco pay €15m for his services after establishing himself as a starter in Galatasaray’s league winning squad.

Galatasaray officially started negotiations with Onyekuru’s manager and the player’s club, Monaco, with both parties agreeing on a six-month loan spell for the price of €1m, while the Nigerian will earn €750, 000 during the loan period.

Galatasaray, who were Turkey’s most active club in the summer transfer window, have failed to make an ideal start to the new season, managing just 10 points after week seven in the 2019/20 Turkish Super Lig season.

Galatasaray coach, Fatih Terim, had lamented the lack of wing organisation and had requested for a fast winger to replicate the deadly attacking football they displayed in the 2018/19 season.

Terim had attempted to have the club sign Onyekuru at the beginning of the season but the club failed to agree on a fee with parent club Everton.

The 22-year-old, who has made four league appearances for Leanardo Jardim’s men, is behind the trio Islam Simani, Wissam Ben Yedder and Gelson Martins in the pecking order.
