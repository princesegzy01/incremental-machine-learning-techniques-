Spanish club, Leganes, have unveiled Nigeria U-20 star Success Makanjuola after he completed a transfer to the Madrid-based club from Water FC of Abuja.

Makanjuola, whose transfer has been completed since August, arrived in Spain on Thursday, to seal a three-year deal.

He is the third Nigerian with Los Pepineros, who already have Kenneth Omeruo and Chidozie Awaziem in their ranks.

Leganes are currently bottom of the table with two points from eight matches and are the only team in the Spanish Primera division without a win this season.

Leganes’ game against Getafe at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez Stadium on Saturday (today) will come too early for the Nigerian but he could make his debut in the home game against newly-promoted Mallorca next week.

Makanjuola, who operates from the wings, made four appearances for the U-20 national team, scoring once, and was part of Paul Aigbogun’s squad to the U-20 World Cup in Poland earlier in the year.
