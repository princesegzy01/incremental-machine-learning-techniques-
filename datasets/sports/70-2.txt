Senate Committee Chairman on Sports, Obinna Ogba, has expressed concern over the 2020 budget for the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development.

Ogba spoke after sports minister, Sunday Dare, sought the Senate’s support for adequate funding of the ministry at a budget session on Thursday.

According to a copy of the 2020 Appropriation Bill obtained by our correspondent, the sports ministry proposed N171,061,527,148 –N168,331,040,938 for recurrent expenditures and N2,730,486,210 for capital – for the 2020 fiscal year.

Ogba, who doubted if the sports ministry would achieve desired result with its proposed budget, said, “If we really want to do something in sports, there is no way this amount budgeted can do anything.”

In a statement, Ogba and other members of the committee commended the “minister’s innovative approach aimed at increasing private participation in youth and sports development.”

Dare noted that the ministry would deliver its mandate better when adequately funded.

“When you look at our budget over the years you know that the ministry is not able to go beyond the level of success we already have,” he added.
