Why there were empty seats against TS Galaxy – Enyimba

The management of Enyimba Football Club of Aba says downpour caused the low turnout witnessed in their CAF Confederation Cup first leg play-off round on Sunday evening.

In a statement by its media officer, Zazi Bariza, on Tuesday, the club debunked reports that the low turnout was because Enyimba have lost fans support.

During the match, which ended 2-0 in favour of the Nigerian giants against the South Africans, there were scanty fans at the Enyimba International Stadium, Aba.

But Bariza said it was wrong to use a match to judge Enyimba’s support base, noting that the club enjoyed massive support throughout last season.

He said, “For a club with record attendance figures in our home games, we were perplexed by the hypothesis on why there were some empty seats in the stadium on Sunday in our match against TS Galaxy.

“Naturally, one would theorise that the rain that day (Sunday) which started around 9am and ended at 2:30pm was the prevailing encumbrance.

“Just over three weeks ago in our CAF Champions League game against Sudan’s Al Hilal, there were more than 10,000 fans in attendance, including the Governor Okezie Ikpeazu. These fans were vociferous throughout and despite the goalless draw were full of support after the final whistle.”
