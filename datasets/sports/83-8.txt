Obafemi Martins is still highly thought of in Italy judging by his Instagram picture, showing a fan carrying a banner “No Martins No Party” posing with the former Inter striker.

The 34-year-old played for the San Siro giants that had a formidable line-up boasting of Adriano, Julio Cruz, Dejan Stankovic, current Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti, winning one Italian title, two Italian Cups and one Italian Super Cup.

Martins left Inter for Newcastle after a four-year spell at the San Siro.

He played 88 Serie A games, scoring 28 goals for the Nerrazzurri.
