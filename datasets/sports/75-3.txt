Sodiq Oyeleke

The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has proposed to spend N171,061,527,148 in the 2020 fiscal year, N168,331,040,938 for recurrent expenditures and N2,730,486,210 for capital.

This was contained in a 2020 budget proposal highlight and breakdown presentation contained in the Appropriation Bill obtained from the Budget Office of the Federation.

Analysis from the breakdown showed that the ministry would spend over 98.4 per cent of its budget on overhead and personnel costs comprising salaries, wages, allowances and social contributions.

This is as the sports sector is faced with myriads of dilapidated stadiums and inadequate sporting facilities.

From the budget breakdown, the sports ministry would spend only 1.6 per cent of its total budget on capital expenditure.

The sports ministry budget constitutes 1.65 per cent of the N10.33trn presented by President Muhammadu Buhari before a joint session of the National Assembly last Tuesday. The budget is yet to be passed by the National Assembly.

In a copy of the breakdown obtained by our correspondent, the sports ministry budget ranked among the top 12 recurrent expenditures in 2020.

With its N2,730,486,210 capital expenditure budget, the ministry was not named among the top 12 in capital spending.

Of the total N2.14tn capital expenditures contained in the 2020 budget, the ministry’s constitutes 0.127 per cent.

In the 2019 fiscal year, the ministry got N126.55bn with the Nigeria Football Federation receiving N1.12bn; Nigeria Institute for Sports – N498.21m; the National Youth Service Corps – N111.6bn; the ministry headquarters – N7.9bn while the Citizenship and Leadership Centre got N1.31bn.

However, N3.88bn was earmarked for capital projects in the sports ministry budget for the 2019 fiscal year.

Meanwhile, the Minister of Sport and Youths Development, Sunday Dare, said he would ensure sports infrastructural development through public, private partnership.

On Monday, the minister announced his meeting with billionaire businessman, Aliko Dangote, and Chief Adebutu Kessington, popularly known as Baba Ijebu.

The minister tweeted, “ I thank Alhaji Dangote for meeting with me this (Monday) afternoon to further our conversation on his support towards the restoration of sporting facilities. A very progressive meeting. Just on Sunday, I had a private meeting with Chief Adebutu Kessington along similar lines.”
