Emery rues Pepe’s miss
Arsenal boss Unai Emery was upset with Nicolas Pepe after defeat at Sheffield United last night.

The Gunners’ £72m summer signing missed a sitter when the game was goalless – and is yet to score from open play for his new club.

Lys Mousset then struck for the brilliant Blades, as Arsenal, who have never won at Sheffield United in the Premier League in four attempts, missed the chance to go third.

Gunners boss Emery moaned, “The chance for us, for Pepe, was the key.

“Because if they score the first goal, defensively they are a very strong team.

“Pepe is improving but the next step for him is to score.

“Usually he is going to score chances like that – but tonight he didn’t take his chance.”
