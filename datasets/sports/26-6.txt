Nigeria are the reigning champions of the AFCON U-23 but will focus first on securing an Olympic ticket to Tokyo before thinking of successfully defending their title says, Huesca midfielder, Kelechi Nwakali in an interview on NFF Youtube channel monitored by Sports Extra.

The former Arsenal player is part of the 14 overseas-based stars included in the final 21-man squad released by Coach Imama Amapakabo on Thursday.

Nigeria will do battle alongside Ivory Coast, South Africa and Zambia in Group B.

And the 21-year-old attacking midfielder has assured fans that the team will make sure they pick up the Tokyo 2020 Olympic ticket.

“I believe the team is ready, and going to Egypt means we have only one mindset, which is to secure the Olympic ticket.

“We want to win every game but, this is football and we will do what we have to do. The first objective is to win the ticket, then any other thing will be a plus.”

Nwakali is unfazed about their group, which has been dubbed tough, and welcomes the test from their opponents.

“The fact that we’re champions is on its own a motivation. We know we have a point to prove. Playing against our opponents is good.

“We respect them that is all, we are not under pressure. We’re in Egypt to deliver, which is to pick the Olympic ticket,” he stated.

Nigeria will kick off their campaign with a game against Ivory Coast on November 9.
