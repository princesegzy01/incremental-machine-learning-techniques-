I’ll love to be Liverpool captain – Alexander-Arnold
Captaining Liverpool is something full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold has “always dreamed of” and “would love to do one day”.

The 21-year-old, born and raised in the city, is one short of 100 games for the club he made his debut for in 2016.

He became the youngest player to start two consecutive Champions League finals when Liverpool beat Tottenham in June.

Alexander-Arnold also said he has never thought about leaving Liverpool and “can’t see that changing”.

Alexander-Arnold spoke in a wide-ranging interview with BBC Radio 5 Live’s Guillem Balague for the Euro Leagues podcast.

The England international said, “I am not shy in saying that (being captain) is a dream for me. Whether it comes true or not is not up to me; I don’t pick who is captain.

“But that is something I would love to do one day. Captaining Liverpool is something I have always dreamed of and it is something that motivates me.

“I have always been a Liverpool player, Liverpool has always been my home. I have never thought about changing clubs.

“I always thought Liverpool was destined to be my club. When I grew up, the dream was always to play for Liverpool. Now I am living the dream and I can’t see that changing.”
