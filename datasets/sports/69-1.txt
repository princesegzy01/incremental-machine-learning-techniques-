Zidane ends Pogba interest
Real Madrid have reportedly ended their interest in Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.

The French international was linked with a move to the Spanish capital throughout the summer but terms could not be agreed and the former Juventus man ended up staying at Old Trafford, where he has had a number of injury issues this season.

According to reports in Spain, Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has seemingly lost interest in a deal now and is actively looking for alternatives.

The report suggests that a key stumbling block in negotiations behind the scenes was the â‚¬180m price tag slapped on Pogba by United, a valuation that Madrid president Florentino Perez was not prepared to meet for any player.

It is believed that Real will now turn their attentions to 24-year-old Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who is seen as a similar player to Pogba but available for a much more reasonable price.
