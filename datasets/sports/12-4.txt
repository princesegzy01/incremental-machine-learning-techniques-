Kaizer Chiefs’ midfielder, Lebogang Manyama, has praised the club’s Nigerian goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi, following his impressive performance for the club, saying he has shown that he can fill the “big shoes” of injured long-time No.1 Itumeleng Khune.

Ahead of the Soweto derby against rivals Orlando Pirates at the FNB Stadium on Saturday (today)‚ Manyama admitted Akpeyi has played a big role in ensuring that Chiefs are on top of the Absa Premiership table going into the Soweto derby.

Akpeyi has only let in five goals in 10 leagues appearances and has been instrumental to the club, who lead their closest rivals Mamelodi Sundowns with seven points.

Manyama said Akpeyi was not getting the credit he deserved in stabilising Chiefs’ defence.

“I think we had this conversation before the season started and I think we’re blessed in that department‚” Manyama said.

“We have three international goalkeepers (Daniel Akpeyi‚ Itumeleng Khune and Bruce Bvuma) – two of them coming from the Africa Cup of Nations.

“It’s a huge experience. Akpeyi is a top keeper and I think maybe people have been too hard on him‚ and obviously he had to fill Itu’s shoes‚ which is not an easy thing to do.”

Manyama feels Akpeyi should have been given more respect based on the fact he’s Nigeria’s No 1.

“If he is No 1 for one of the biggest countries in Africa in terms of football it’s not a coincidence‚” Manyama continued.

“It’s because he has quality to play in such a team in such a country that we believe in him and we kept on supporting him. He has helped us a lot and I think we’re very blessed to have him.”
