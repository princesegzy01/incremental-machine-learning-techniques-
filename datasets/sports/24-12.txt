Everton fans have criticised Alex Iwobi on Twitter in the wake of his below-par performance in the Toffees 1-1 home draw with Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, Sports Extra reports.

The 23-year-old winger featured for the entire 90 minutes and did not have a good game. He was also at fault for the goal that Tottenham scored.

According to WhoScored, Iwobi played one key pass, had a pass accuracy of 78.6%, took 45 touches, attempted three dribbles, and made five tackles and one interception.

“Far too much, this game is here for whoever takes it by the scruff of the neck. Iwobi needs to do more and get on the ball more,” @johnriledog reacted on Twitter to Iwobi’s performance.

Chris @tenzochris also wrote, “Iwobi what on earth are you doing. Shocking goal to concede.”

“Iwobi, Mina, Gomes, Gyfli, Walcott, Dominic Calvert Lewin all s*** and no wonder why Everton are bottom of the table,” Simon Currie added

“Really poor from Iwobi there for Alli’s goal. Just a complete lack of concentration. Has just gifted them a the goal,” Kevin @OTTSenators9 Mark Eccles added, “Iwobi has been all kinds of comedy today (Sunday).A disappointing result for Everton.”

Everton have been struggling this season, and the draw with Tottenham on Sunday evening will come as a bitter disappointment for the Goodison Park faithful.

The Merseyside outfit are 17th in the Premier League table at the moment with 11 points from 11 matches, three points above the relegation zone.
