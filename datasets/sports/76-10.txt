Fifth seed, Calvin Hemery, won the men’s singles event of the Lagos Open International Tennis Championships on Monday.

The French player, who has a Nigerian father, had a relatively easy final as he defeated Bosnian Aldin Sektic 6-1, 6-2.

Sektic won the 2015 Lagos Open, and was hoping to take home this year’s title, while Hemery didn’t drop a single set on his way to the final.

The win was Hemery’s first ITF title of the year, and his second in Nigeria.

“I feel great, I feel very happy with the win, it’s been a tough tournament for me because we played a lot of matches and to finish with a trophy, it’s very great for me, I’m very happy,” Hemery said after his win.

“There is nothing like an easy match, the score was easy, but the match was not in any way easy, it was a tough match. I had to be focused for every single point because if I gave him (Sektic) a chance to come back, maybe he will play better. You have to stay focused for the entire match even if it’s easy. It was an easy score, but not an easy match, so I’m very happy.”
