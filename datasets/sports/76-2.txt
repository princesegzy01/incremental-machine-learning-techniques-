Akpeyi wins first title in South Africa

Nigeria goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi, says he excited after helping Kaizer Chiefs win their first trophy of the season in a 4-2 humiliation of rivals Mamelodi Sundowns to lift the Shell Helix Ultra Cup on Saturday at the FNB stadium in Johannesburg.

Akpeyi, who was on for the entire duration of the game, was partly responsible for Sundown’s first goal after parrying Gaston Sirino’s curl into the path of Jose Meza, who needed no second invitation hitting the ball into the net from close range.

But the goalkeeper redeemed himself with a last-ditch palm from Hlompho Kekana’s header to reduce pressure on his team.

The shot-stopper moved to South Africa in 2015, joining Chippa United from Warri Wolves, before making a switch to former South African Premier League champions Chiefs in January 2019.

“I’ve been so hungry for a trophy in the PSL, working day after day, praying without ceasing and keeping my faith stronger against all odds as the days goes by.

“Though it may tarry, but I will wait on God because He is not a man that He should lie, neither the son of man that repent; His words are yeah and Amen. This is the beginning of greater things to come in this season,” he wrote on Instagram.
