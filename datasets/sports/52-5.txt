Etebo suffers thigh injury

Super Eagles midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo may miss Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Benin Republic and Lesotho next month on account of a thigh injury, Sports Extra reports.

The Nigeria international was forced off after 21 minutes in Stoke City’s 1-0 loss away to Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on Tuesday. He was replaced by Mark Duffy.

Massimo Luongo’s strike condemned Stoke City to an eighth defeat of the season in the Championship.

“Carter-Vickers suffered a cut while Etebo copped a muscular thigh injury which will take a while to recover,” Nathan Jones told a post-match conference after the game.

“He will undergo scans tomorrow (Thursday) but could be out for two to four weeks.

“To lose Etebo early was a big blow for us and then lose your centre-half, invariably the one that came on makes a big error for the only goal of the game.”

Etebo, who missed the Eagles’ last game against Brazil, has been one of the Potters’ best players so far this season and has played 11 games.

Should Etebo miss the game, it will offer Joe Aribo another opportunity to make his third straight start for the Eagles.

Next up for Stoke is a trip to London to face former boss Gary Rowett when he takes full charge of Millwall for the first time and Etebo will play no part in it.
