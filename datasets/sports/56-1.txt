Super Eagles and Udinese defender, William Troost-Ekong, has been listed in Serie A’s Team of The Week for match day eight according to forzaitalianfootball.com.

The Nigerian, in a commanding display, helped the Bianconeri keep their fourth league clean sheet of the season in a 1-0 win over Torino at the Friuli Stadium on Sunday, with Stephano Okaka scoring the only goal of the encounter.

The 26-year-old made five clearances, blocked four shots, one interception and made three tackles.

In a 3-4-3 formation, Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret, after keeping a clean s heet against Hellas Verona, was named in goal while Troost-Ekong, Lecce’s Marco Calderoni and Brescia’s Andrea Cistana completed the defence line.

In the midfield, Atalanta’s Alejandro Gomez joins Cagliari’s Radja Nainggolan, AC Milan’s Hakan Calhanoglu and Parma’s Dejan Kulusevski, who provided two assists and a goal in the Ducali’s 5-1 thrashing of Genoa.

Barcelona target Lautaro Martinez of Inter Milan, Parma’s Andreas Cornelius and Napoli’s Arkadiusz Milik complete the trident attack for the Serie A Team of The Week.
