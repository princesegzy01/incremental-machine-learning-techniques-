’Tosin Oluwalowo

Frenchman, Calvin Hemery, needed only 63 minutes to dispatch Takanyi Garanganga 6-4, 6-0 in the semi-final of the Lagos Open Tennis championships on Sunday to qualify for the final.

The fifth seed was too good for his opponent, taking the first set 6-4, before powering on in the second set with a 6-0 victory.

He will face Bosnia’s Aldin Sektic, who is seeded sixth.

Sektic needed three sets to overcome fourth seed David Pichler in the semi-finals.

The Bosnian saved two break points in the fifth game before going on to break in the eight game, winning the first set 6-3.

Pichler however fought back to claim the second set 7-5, forcing the match to a deciding third set.

The 2015 Lagos Open champion then claimed the third set 6-2, winning the match in two hours 41 minutes.

The final match between Hemery and Sektic will be played at the centre court of the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club Onikan on Monday (today).
