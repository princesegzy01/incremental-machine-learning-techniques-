Woodward fed up with Solskjaer
Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is reportedly losing patience with boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after the club’s latest defeat.

The Red Devils’ 1-0 reverse to Newcastle United on Sunday leaves them with just nine points from their opening eight games – their worst start to a season in 30 years.

According to the Daily Mirror, United’s poor run and rumours of dressing room discontent have led Woodward to lose faith in the Norwegian he gave a three-year contract to as manager back in March.

It is believed that the game with Liverpool following the international break could be make or break for Solskjaer as the likes of Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial, Luke Shaw, Victor Lindelof and Aaron Wan-Bissaka are all expected to be back for that fixture after missing the Newcastle match.

This report conflicts with earlier stories that suggested Solskjaer still had the backing of the club’s controversial executive vice-chairman.
