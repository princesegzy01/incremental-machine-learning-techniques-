Oliseh rejects Waasland Beveren offer
Johnny Edward

Former Super Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh turned down an approach from Belgian topflight division Waasland Beveren because the offer was “not suitable for him”, Sports Extra reports.

Oliseh has been out of management since he parted ways with Fortuna Sittard in 2018.

The 45-year-old former Nigeria captain had earlier in September turned down a mouth-watering offer worth €3m annually with another €1m in bonuses to manage an unnamed Turkish second division club because he still wants to be with his family.

“I have to be patient and wait for the right opportunity and the right offer because what I got from a team currently one place above the relegation spot could be better.

“It’s quite good because it’s close to my family but the financial terms are not suitable for me.”
