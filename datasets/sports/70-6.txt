Super Eagles midfielder, Sunday Mba, says things are tough for him after being released by Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor since September 2017.

The player, who was instrumental to Nigeria winning the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, expressed readiness to return to active football.

“As a free agent, things are not really that easy, but you can only be hopeful. My desire is to get back into club football and I am working hard to start playing again.

”Football is everything I have and I cannot just give up. I believe there’s something out there for me,” Mba told BBC Sport.

Despite being a free agent, the 30-year-old said he hasn’t relented on keeping fit and training regularly.

He added, “First you’d need the luck to find someone that believes in you and ready to give you a chance. I’ve continued to stay in shape, train daily and be physically ready for any opportunity.

”I still have something to give and will continue to stay mentally and physically ready.”

The midfielder was impressive at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, where he scored two goals, including his match-winner against Burkina Faso, which helped the Super Eagles clinch the trophy for the third time in their history.

Mba scored twice to help his country’s B side to success at the regional West African Football Union Cup title in 2010.

He has scored three goals in 16 appearances for the three time African champions.

Mba played for both Enugu Rangers and Warri Wolves in the Nigerian top flight before switching to French club CA Bastia.

He left for Turkish side Yeni Malatyaspor in July 2015- where he netted eight goals in 55 appearances.
