Lille striker, Vctor Osimhen, received a hero’s welcome in Belgium after paying a visit to former club Sporting Charleroi to watch the team in their 2-1 home loss to Anderlecht in the Belgian Pro-League on Friday.

Osimhen received a standing ovation from the club fans, who chanted his name as he walked around the pitch waving at the supporters and also receiving pleasantries from former teammates and the coaching crew.

After spending a successful loan season with Charleroi, the club purchased his services from Wolfsburg, before selling the striker to Ligue 1 side Lille in the summer, where he has had a bright start to life, scoring seven goals in 10 appearances.

Osimhen established himself at the club as a cult figure hero scoring 20 goals in 36 appearances.

The Nigeria striker wrote on his Instagram handle, “Feels so good to be here again.”

The club replied, “Welcome back Osimhen.”
