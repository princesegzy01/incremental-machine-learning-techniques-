Striker Kelechi Iheanacho has struggled to break into Leicester City’s starting IX this season and manager, Brendan Rodgers, admits he feels for the Foxes’ fringe players as he praised their contribution to the team’s stunning form.

The Nigeria international has not featured in Leicester’s league fixtures this season, featuring only twice in the Carabao Cup for the Kingpower outfit.

Four straight wins have taken Leicester to second place in the Premier League as Rodgers sticks with a core group for his starting XI.

“It’s not hard to keep the squad happy but I have empathy for the guys because we’re only at the level we’re at because of the players that aren’t playing,” he said.

“We’ve got guys like Wes Morgan, Marc Albrighton, Christian Fuchs, Demarai Gray, Dennis Praet, all these guys aren’t starting games.

“Their mentality and focus allows us to be the best that we can. It’s my job to manage that, I speak a lot with the players, they understand where it’s at, they’re clear on where they stand within the squad,” he told Leicester Mercury.
