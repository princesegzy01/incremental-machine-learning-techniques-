Members of the Nigeria Football Federation Reforms Committee met 10 months after their inauguration in Abuja.

The committee was inaugurated in December 2018 after the Congress of Nigerian Football gave a mandate at the Annual General Assembly in October 2018.

A statement by the NFF said members of the committee on Tuesday evening ended a two-day meeting.

The meeting focused “on how to best re-position Nigerian football through tinkering with governance structure, women’s football and youth/grassroots development and the various leagues,” the statement added.

Chairman of the committee, Seyi Akinwunmi, who is also NFF’s 1st vice president, said, “The committee’s final recommendations would be implemented by the NFF.”

Akinwunmi expressed satisfaction with the progress made during the meeting, the quality and robustness of discussions.

He noted that “recommendations will soon be made to the NFF Executive Committee, who in turn will be expected to put them forward to the congress for deliberation, and hopefully, ratification.”

“The committee reviewed previous headings/documents emanating from its previous meetings, dwelt on NFF governance structure, league football, women’s football and commercial matters,” the statement added.
