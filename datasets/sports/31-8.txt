Madrid to offload Modric in January transfer window
Real Madrid will reportedly look to sell experienced midfielder Luka Modric during the January transfer window.

Modric won the 2018 Ballon d’Or for his outstanding form at club and international level, but the 34-year-old has struggled to make his mark in the early stages of the 2019-20 campaign.

Injuries have restricted the Croatia international to just five La Liga appearances, while his contract at the Bernabeu will expire at the end of next season.

According to Calciomercato, Los Blancos are prepared to sell the former Tottenham Hotspur playmaker in January and would be willing to accept offers in the region of £8.6m.

Both Inter Milan and AC Milan have been mentioned as possible suitors for the 2018 World Cup finalist, who has made over 300 appearances for Madrid since arriving from Tottenham in 2012.
