Manu Garba’s Golden Eaglets have won Nigerians over at the ongoing FIFA U-17 cadet World Cup in Brazil after zooming into the next round following their two wins against Hungary and Ecuador respectively to go top of Group B.

The Golden Eaglets secured their qualification to the next round after a hard-fought victory, which saw them comeback from behind and condemn the South Americans to their first defeat on match-day two.

Ibrahim Said’s treble sunk the Ecuadorians at the Estadio Olimpico in Goiania.

And one Super Eagles star that seems to have been impressed with the youngsters’ display so far at the competition is Ikechukwu Ezenwa.

The Katsina United goalie took to his instagram handle to celebrate the team.

He wrote, “So happy for you guys,” with a champagne emoji.
