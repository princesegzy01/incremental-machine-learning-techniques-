Super Falcons captain, Asisat Oshoala, scored the winner as Barcelona beat Sporting de Huelva 1-0 in their Spanish Primera Iberdrola clash on Sunday.

Oshoala’s goal condemned Huelva with Nigeria’s Peace Efih, Ghana’s Princella Adubea, Equatorial Guinea’s Oluwatobiloba Olanrewaju and Gambia’s Fatoumata Kanteh to a fourth league defeat.

With Sunday’s goal, Oshoala has now scored four goals in five league matches this season for Barcelona.

The win sees Barcelona retain the summit of the log on goal difference with 13 points from five matches, while Huelva are 13th with three points after five games.

The Nigeria international had ended her goal drought in the Spanish topflight with a brace in Barcelona’s 6-1 comeback thrashing of Atletico Madrid, before sealing a 2-0 win at Sevilla.

The Falcons striker also scored for Nigeria in last Monday’s 1-1 draw against Ivory Coast as the African champions crashed out of the 2020 Olympic qualifiers at the Agege Township stadium, Lagos.
