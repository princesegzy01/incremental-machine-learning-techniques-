Wenger is an absolute legend – Fergie
Sir Alex Ferguson hailed Arsene Wenger as “an absolute legend” as the former Arsenal boss enjoyed a special night in his honour.

On Monday night, Wenger was named a ‘Legend of Football’ at the annual Nordoff Robbins charity award dinner.

Wenger was celebrated after a career in which he won trophies as a manager in England, France and Japan – but most notably during his 21-year tenure as manager of Arsenal.

During that time, Wenger won three Premier League titles, seven FA Cups and seven FA Community Shields.

He also enjoyed a heated rivalry with Ferguson, whose Manchester United side, together with Wenger’s Arsenal, dominated English football in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The rivalry often spilled over into bust-ups – famously including ‘Pizzagate’, when Ferguson took a slice of pizza in the face in the tunnel after his United side had ended Arsenal 49-game unbeaten Premier League run.

But speaking on Sunday night, Ferguson was effusive in his praise of Wenger.

Addressing his old adversary via video, Ferguson said, “The career you had as a manager at Arsenal was absolutely fantastic – an absolute legend.

“I loved the competition against you. We had some great times and it’s wonderful you’re getting this award tonight. So good luck, my blessing with you.”
