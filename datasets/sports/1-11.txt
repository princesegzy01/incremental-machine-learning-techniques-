Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has warned his team against being overconfident, thinking they are the best team in Africa.

The coach was speaking after his side’s 2-1 victory over Benin Republic in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier opener in Uyo on Wednesday.

Rohr said although he had an array of talents and his team improved in the second half, he will only be excited if they win the AFCON.

“I seem to be excited, I can, because we played well in the second half, but you never know what will happen in the next match,” Rohr said.

“So, they must stay humble, like I told them after the Brazil game, ‘don’t believe because you drew against Brazil, you are now the best team in Africa.’

“There is still a lot of work to do. I will be excited if we win the AFCON.”

Nigeria, who top Group L with three points, will play Lesotho in their second AFCON qualifier in Maseru on Sunday.
