2019 FIBA ACC: Air Warriors, MFM get automatic tickets
Two Nigerian women basketball club representatives, Air Warriors and MFM Queens of Lagos, have qualified automatically for the 2019 FIBA Africa Club championship to be played in December.

The pair are been joined by Energie Club of Cotonou who also qualified for the final round according to a statement from the FIBA Africa Zone 3 media department.

Air Warriors who made their debut in the women’s league were crowned the 2019 Zenith Bank Women Basketball League Champions after a hard earned 55-53 point victory against MFM Queens in the final.

The Abuja-based side became the first women’s club to win the league in its first year while also setting an enviable record of being the first Savannah Conference side to win the league which had been largely dominated by First Bank of Lagos with nine titles.

MFM on their part improved on their 2018 season when they finished fourth under coach Aderemi Adewunmi to win their first-ever silver medal.

FIBA Africa will decide the final host of the competition between Angola and Madagascar who have both indicated interest to host the apex women’s club championship in Africa.

It means that no Nigerian club side (men and women) will be participating in the FIBA Africa zonal elimination series starting on October 28 in Cotonou, Benin Republic with Nigeria already given an automatic slot to the 2020 NBA-FIBA Africa organised Basketball League.
