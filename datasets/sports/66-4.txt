Osimhen to Lille fans: I will keep working hard
Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen, has promised Lille fans he will keep working hard and scoring goals after winning the Ligue 1 player of the month for September on Thursday.

Osimhen saw off the challenges from in-form Monaco’s Algerian international Islam Slimani and veteran Nantes defender Nicolas Pallois to the monthly honour awarded by the Player’s Union.

The Nigerian international has scored eight goals in all competitions for the French side in 11 appearances.

Appreciating the fans who voted for him in a short video posted by the club’s official Twitter handle, Osimhen promised to keep doing his best for the common good of the club.

“Thank you very much for voting for me as the Ligue 1 player of the month for September, I really appreciate you all, and thanks a lot for what you have done for me since joining the club. I promise to continue to work hard and give my best for the common good of the club.”

Osimhen was voted Lille’s player of the month for August and September. The striker who is yet to score a goal away from home will be hoping to break his duck when they face Toulouse on Saturday (today).
