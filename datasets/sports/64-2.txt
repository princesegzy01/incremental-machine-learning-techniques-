CHAN: Hawks fly pass Eagles
Ebenezer Bajela

A brace for Sikiru Alimi against Togo in a must win second leg qualifier encounter at the Agege Stadium, Lagos, on Saturday was not enough to see the Super Eagles B team book a place for the 2020 African Nations Championship which will take place in Cameroon.

Imama Amamapakabo’s side needed to score at least three goals without conceding to have any chance of qualifying for the tournament after losing the first leg away at the Stade de Kegue, Lome by 4-1 last month.

The team also suffered another defeat to the same side by 2-1 at the WAFU tournament in Senegal last week.

The second leg in Lagos ended 2-0 in favour of the Eagles courtesy of Alimi brace but Nigeria lose 3-4 on aggregate to crash out and leave Imama with plenty questions to answer.

Alimi scored the opener in the ninth minute but the Togolese were happy to sit back and soak up the pressure as they tried to hit the Eagles on the counter.

The Lobi Star player got his and the country’s second goal in the 72nd minute to give hope to the fans watching at the Agege Stadium as they continued to search for the third goal.

The Hawks held on firm for the remainder of the minutes to book their place at next year championship in Cameroon.

The Agege Stadium has witnessed two teams fail to progress to tournaments after the Super Falcons also saw their Olympics hopes crushed by Ivory Coast last month.
