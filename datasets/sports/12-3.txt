President of the Nigeria Shooting Sport Federation, Brig. General Lonsdale Adeoye (retd.), has said that qualifying for 2020 Tokyo Olympics is the primary aim of the federation, as trials for its shooters in preparation for the forthcoming African Shooting Sport Championships continues.

The African championships, which is a pre-requisite for the Olympics, will take place in Tipasa, Algeria, between November 17 and 25.

Adeoye said the championships will comprise of professional and young shooters, which would also serve as an avenue for Nigeria to pick qualification slots for its athletes towards the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.

He stated, “We have between 500 to 600 veteran athletes, young shooters and many who are supposed to be here already in Abuja for the trials, which started on Thursday and we have to choose the best out of them. We will begin training with pistols, rifles and other aspects.”

On the number of shooters that will be selected, the federation president said.

“That is the challenge we are facing now because we have so many shooters but we want to pick the best. Egypt will have about 200 shooters for the African championships and they want to pick all the tickets for the Olympics, but we will try everything we can to ensure that that we pick up tickets as well.

“All our shooters who almost made the minimum qualifying marks by one or two points have been brought together alongside the young ones.

“And I must tell you that the young ones are already doing great.”
