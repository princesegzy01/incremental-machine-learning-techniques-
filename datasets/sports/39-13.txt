Captain of the U-17 team, Samson Tijani, has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s words of encouragement has lifted the morale of the team, adding that the players are looking forward to qualify for the Round of 16 of the 2019 U-17 World Cup when they play Ecuador on Tuesday (today) in Goiania, Brazil.

Following the Eaglets’ 4-2 win over Hungary on Saturday, Buhari sent a congratulatory message to the team and Tijani, who was named man-of-the-match following his two goals in the opening encounter, said the team will head into their next team with greater determination.

“We are very happy to have seen the congratulatory messages by Mr. President,” Tijani told thenff.com.

“Our morale has been lifted even higher, and we will go into the match against Ecuador with greater determination to win.”

A victory against the South Americans will guarantee a passage to the next round of the tournament, which could afford coach, Manu Garba, the opportunity to rest key players in the last Group B game against Australia.
