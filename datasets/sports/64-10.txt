Fans want Iwobi as No. 10

Everton fans have called on manager Marco Silva to keep playing Alex Iwobi in his traditional No. 10 position after the Nigerian produced an outstanding performance in their 2-0 win against West Ham United on Saturday.

Iwobi played through the wings for the larger part of his Arsenal career, but has shown he can be better in the creative midfield role, which he plays for the national team.

Since joining the Toffees, the Nigerian has been deployed to the wings but his first test in the No. 10 position has got him rave reviews from fans of the club.

Reacting to his performance, fans tweeted that Iwobi should be deployed in that position ahead of Iceland star Gylfi Sigurðsson.

“David Bricey wrote on Twitter, “Gylfi’s moment of magic aside, still think Iwobi should get a run as our 10. Bernard left a must. Love Seamus to death, but Sidibe needs to start.”

Despite his impressive display, Iwobi failed to convert a clear goal opportunity and fans believes if he could work on that, he will be a joy to watch.

Jeremy Liit wrote, “Iwobi is one of the best at attacking half spaces, breaking lines and playing vertical passes but this guy needs to lock himself in a room for hours every day and learn how to shoot. Makes no sense to be so good at the difficult things and struggle at the easiest one.”
