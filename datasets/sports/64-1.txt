Al Ahlyâ€™s Nigerian forward, Junior Ajayi, goal in their 3-2 win against Zamalek was voted as the club goal of the month for September.

Ajayi scored at either half of the match in the Super Cup clash on September 20 at the Borg El Arab Stadium to help claimed the trophy.

His powerful shot which find its way into the back of the net in the 19th minute was nominated and won the award for the best goal last month.

The 23-year-old has scored two goals in three league appearances for Al Ahly this season and looks likely to improve on his tally of four goals in 15 appearances last season.

Ajayi is expected to continue his rich vein of form when the CAF champions League resume in November.
