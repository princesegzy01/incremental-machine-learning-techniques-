Ndidi’s Foxes main man – Keown
Johnny Edward

Former England and Arsenal defender Martin Keown has heaped special plaudits on Wilfred Ndidi for Leicester City’s impressive start to the Premier League this season.

Leicester have made their best start to a top-flight season in their 135-year history having conceded only eight

goals, the joint-best record in the top-flight along with Sheffield United.

They posted a sterling performance as the Foxes recorded a 2-0 Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in which Ndidi made 69 touches against Palace, won 18 duels and also made eight tackles and winning possession 10 times in the encounter.

And Keown added that the Nigeria international offers the Foxes defence extra security.

“I liked the way Ndidi popped in and out between his two centre-backs when needed, and also went out wide to deal with any issues when his full-backs needed help.

“He covered a lot of ground,” Keown wrote in his weekly analysis of the EPL matchday review on The BBC.

“With Ndidi in the team, his central defenders know they only have to worry about balls in behind them because if a team tries to play to feet in front of them, Ndidi will almost always be there.”

Ndidi has made 10 appearances this season, scoring twice.
