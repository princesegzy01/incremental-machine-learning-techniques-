Adisa Beyioku has been appointed as the new Secretary-General of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria.

His deployment was contained in a statement by the Ministry of Youths and Sports Development on Sunday in Abuja.

Beyioku replaces Elijah Adamu, who was recalled after being indicted by the report of an Advisory Committee on Team Nigeria’s poor performance at the 2019 IAAF World Athletics Championships.

Apart from Adamu, the report also led to the sack of Sunday Adeleye as AFN’s Technical Director.

Beyioku led Team Nigeria to the 2001 World Athletics Championships in Edmonton, Canada.

He led the likes of the late Sunday Bada, Chioma Ajunwa and Falilat Ogunkoya as members of a glorious team which set several records.

Beyioku, who was born on February 7 in 1975 at Ilorin in Kwara, is an accomplished sports administrator and an indigene of Oyo State.

The new AFN Secretary-General obtained his first major educational qualification — Higher National Diploma in Computer Science — at the Kwara State Polytechnic in Ilorin in 1996.

He was earlier deployed to the AFN in Lagos as an Assistant Secretary-General.

After working with the Nigeria Table Tennis Federation from 2002 to 2003, he moved to the Nigeria Rugby Football Federation as Secretary-General in 2003.

He worked with the Nigeria Volleyball Federation from 2012 to 2017, before being moved to FEAD in the Sports Ministry’s headquarters in Abuja.

Before his new appointment, he had moved on to being in charge of the Elite Athletes Unit at FEAD, overseeing participation in international competitions by the national federations.
