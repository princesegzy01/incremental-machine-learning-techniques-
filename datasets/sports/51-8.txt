EPL Top 10 Performers: Ndidi makes list
Solape Lawal-Solarin

Wilfred Ndidi has settled perfectly into Premier League life ever since making the switch from KRC Genk to Leicester City in a deal worth £17m in 2017.

His performances have defied the adjustment problems that had always plagued foreign imports in the league.

This season, Ndidi has made 123 tackles more than anyone in the Premier League, a stat that shows how well he continues to perform as a defensive midfielder for Leicester City. His 123 tackles put him above other top tacklers like Idrissa Gueye of Everton and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who have 121 and 115 respectively.

And based on the latest compilations of in-form top 10 best performers in the last six appearances by whoscored.com, the Super Eagles defensive midfielder is ranked 8th.

Ndidi recorded a team-topping number of duels, interceptions and aerial challenges during the win over Burnley to earn a spot in the top 10.

The Foxes midfielder had a high performance score of 7.60 to stay ahead of City’s Raheem Sterling who’s placed 9th with 7.57 and Blues midfielder Jorginho ranked 10th with 7.54 performance score.

Ndidi has played eight times in the league, bagging two goals so far this season for the Foxes.
