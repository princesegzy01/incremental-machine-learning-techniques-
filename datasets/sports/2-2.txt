National U-23 defender, Valentine Ozornwafor, says they have no other option than to win their last Group B clash against South Africa at the U-23 AFCON in Egypt on Friday, at the Al-Salam Stadium, Cairo.

A win for the Nigerians will see them secure a spot in the semi-finals of the tournament, which also doubles as qualifiers for next year’s Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

Ozornwafor insisted that the game against the Amagluglug will be treated like a final.

Nigeria, defending champions, are second with three points and must defeat South Africa, who currently sit top of the group with four points.

“It will be a different ball game; South Africa game will be a different ball game,” the 20-year-old said.

“Like I said, we will take every game in a gradual process. As they come, we take every game like a final.

“The South Africa game; we’ll take it like a final. If we lose, we are out, if we win, we are in the tournament.”

The top three teams at the tournament, which is in its 3rd edition, will advance to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
