Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has joined the list of Foxes stars to pay tribute to the club’s late owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.

On October 27, 2018, a helicopter crashed shortly after take-off from the King Power Stadium- the home ground of the club- killing all five people on board – the pilot and four passengers, which included the club’s Thai billionaire owner Srivaddhanaprabha.

The club’s officials and players have been in sober mood, reflecting on his exit and offering a moment of silent in their clash against Burnley as they prepare for his first anniversary at the end of the month.

And the Super Eagles midfielder, who joined the former Premier League champions during the reign of the Thai billionaire for around £17m from Genk in 2016, paid tribute on Instagram.

He wrote, “Forever in our hearts Boss, RIP Boss”.

The 25-year-old has played seven times, bagging two league goals in the process for the Foxes this season.
