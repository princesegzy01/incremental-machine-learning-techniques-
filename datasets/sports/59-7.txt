WABU boss lauds GOtv Boxing Night Mini initiative
President of the West African Boxing Union, Mr. Remi Aboderin, has commended GOtv for introducing the GOtv Boxing Night Mini, a smaller version of the popular GOtv Boxing Night. Speaking in Lagos on Sunday, Aboderin, who is also the Secretary-General of the Nigerian Boxing Board of Control, said GOtv Boxing Night Mini has the potential to take the sport to the next level.

The WABU boss stated that GOtv Boxing Night Mini, which is conceived to hold more regularly, will offer many more Nigerian boxers the opportunity for fights that will help boost their fight records.

“It is undisputable that GOtv Boxing Night is the most regular platform on which our professional boxers get to fight because it holds every three months or thereabouts. There are other promotions, but they’re not of the same regularity, meaning that it is one for which most boxers aim. But with GOtv Boxing Night Mini, additional fight opportunities have been presented and many more boxers can benefit,” he said.

The inaugural edition of GOtv Boxing Night Mini will hold on November 16 at the Rowe Park Sports Complex in Lagos.
