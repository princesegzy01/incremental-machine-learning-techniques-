In a bid to stop drug use among athletes, Nigeria and 187 countries have endorsed the Paris Convention Against Doping.

Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, made this known on his official Twitter handle.

The minister, who led Nigeriaâ€™s delegation to the convention alongside the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Olusade Adesola, said Nigeria would domesticate the anti-doping code.

He also warned athletes in the country to shun the use of drugs, saying Nigeria frowns at doping.
