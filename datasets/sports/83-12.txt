Drop Danjuma as Falcons’ coach, fans tell NFF
Sodiq Oyeleke

Fans across the country have urged the leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation to replace Christopher Danjuma as coach of the Super Falcons.

Danjuma was named as the Falcons coach after Swede Thomas Dennerby left the country over unpaid allowances and alleged interference in the administration of the Falcons by NFF officials.

Under Dennerby, the Falcons reached the Last 16 of this year’s World Cup after they won the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations last year.

The fans wondered why Danjuma was hurriedly appointed, alleging that he was not prepared for the job.

The fans referred to statistics, stating that Falcons failed to qualify for Olympics in 2015 and 2019 with Danjuma in charge of the team.

Nigeria lost their 2016 Rio Olympics ticket to Equatorial Guinea 3-2 on aggregate with Danjuma in charge.

They were also eliminated from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics after playing 1-1 draw with Ivory Coast on Monday in Lagos. They lost on the away-goal rule, having recorded a goalless draw in the first leg in Abidjan.

One of the fans, John Opeoluwa, wrote, “We paraded poor coaches locally. Very few of them are exceptional. They are tactically deficient,” he added.

Akeem Oyalowo, who called for sanction of officials that caused Falcons’ disqualification, said, “Start by getting rid of that coach. Falcons have never been poorer in terms of quality of play.”

Tochi Makata said, “How would you bring back a coach who has failed and failed again to carry out a simple but important assignment as this?”

Ewarah Victor added, “This is the result of godfatherism in Nigeria football.”
