Goals from two Golden Eaglets’ players, Ibrahim Sa’id and Peter Olawale, are in contention for the 2019 U-17 World Cup Goal of the Tournament.

FIFA featured the goals in a video analysis on Wednesday.

The football body said the goals selected are the best from matches played in the group stage of the tournament.

This is despite Nigeria’s exit from the tournament after losing 3-1 to The Netherlands in their Round of 16 game early Wednesday morning.

While Sai’d netted a hat-trick when Eaglets came from behind to beat Ecuador 3-2, Olawale equalised in the 21st minute with a terrific curled, left-footed shot from the edge of the box that beat Australia goalkeeper Adam Pavlesic.

FIFA said, “The first 36 matches of the FIFA U-17 World Cup Brazil 2019 produced spectacular goals in variety, from sensational solo efforts to incisive team moves.

“Brazil’s Veron and Italy’s Degnand Gnonto ripped apart opposing defences with their barreling runs through midfield.

“Nigeria’s Sai’d and France’s Timothee Pembele flashed masterful technique with their curling strikes.

“Argentina’s Matias Godoy exhibited strength and control in tight space for his finish, making sure that team-mate Matias Palacios’ spinning backheel service was not in vain.”

FIFA announced that voting for the Goal of the Tournament would commence after the final.
