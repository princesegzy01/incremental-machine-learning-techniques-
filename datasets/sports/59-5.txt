Super Falcons captain, Asisat Oshoala, has dedicated her goal against Logrono on Sunday to patients of breast cancer.

She made this known in a tweet on Monday.

Oshoala scored her fifth league goal in the 51st minute as Barca won 5-0.

Celebrating her goal, Oshoala said, “This (the goal) is also to support all those fighting against breast cancer. Stay stronger.”

Her remarks were in commemoration of the 2019 Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which is usually October.

Also, the Nigerian star attributed her impressive goal scoring form to support from her teammates.

When asked about her scoring secret, she told Goal, “I think it’s about the team spirit and the love from the girls. Each game we play, we try to encourage each other, even when people make mistakes on the field of play.

“We don’t yell at each other but encourage ourselves. In difficult moments, when we try to get goals in very important games, we try to keep our heads up and encourage each other on the field of play.

“It’s the most important thing in football when you have teammates that help you get better in every game.”

With five goals in six league games, Oshoala is the second joint-top scorer on the Primera Iberdrola scorers chart, two behind Barcelona teammate and leading scorer Jenni Hermoso.
