Tobi Amusan has become the first Nigerian athlete to qualify for women’s 100m hurdles final at World Championships since 20 years.

She broke the 20-year-old record of Gloria Alozie, who made the podium at the seventh edition of the championships in Seville, Spain in 1999.

Though Alozie ran a Personal Best of 12.44secs to win a silver medal, Amusan ran 12.48secs at the 2019 Doha.

At the ongoing World Championships in Doha, Amusan powered to a new PB of 12.48secs to qualify for the final, where she emerged fourth.

With her poor start, she ran 12.49secs to rank behind American Nia Ali who emerged first in 12.34secs; American Kendra Harrison, second in 12.46secs; and Jamaican Danielle Williams, third in 12.47secs.

Amusan, who is the reigning African and Commonwealth Champion, has the fastest time in the heat of the event.

Amusan earlier told journalists before her race on Sunday that she wasn’t fully confident of herself.

“The goal is to come out and execute, take each round at a time,” she added.

On her expectation of a new PB, she said, “Not really, but once you execute like my coach would say, ‘expect the unexpected.’ Going into the semi-finals, I’ve a little bit of confidence, let God lead me.”

At the 2019 African Games held in Rabat, Morocco, Amusan also broke a 20-year-old record previously held by Alozie in the 100m women’s hurdles by winning in the event.
