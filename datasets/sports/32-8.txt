Arsenal, City battle for £60m Isco
ARSENAL are said to be prepared to fight it out with Manchester City to sign Isco as a replacement for Mesut Ozil.

Reports in Spain suggest the Gunners are looking at the Real Madrid star with the view to him coming in to succeed Ozil as the playmaker at the Emirates.

Arsenal manager Unai Emery is hardly hiding the fact he no longer sees the World Cup winner as a key part of his first team plans at the Emirates.

And that has been enough for Mundo Deportivo to say that Emery is keen to bring in a replacement for Ozil in the shape of Real Madrid’s Isco.

They say the Gunners and City are prepared to do battle for the Spanish international playmaker who is once again seemingly out of favour at the Bernabeu.
