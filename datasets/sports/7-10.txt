Raak wins Ondo Auto Rally
Estonian Argo Raak over the weekend won the third Ondo State Auto Rally organised by Motorsports group Work and Play at Ilara-Mokin.

The race, which paraded some of the best off-road racers in the country, took place at the new Off Road Track.

Raak, whose off-road buggy crashed to deny him a podium chance at the 2018 edition, said he was fully prepared for this year’s championship.

“I have put in a lot in preparation for this year’s edition, practicing for two months and I’m very delighted to return the best time at this year’s event,” he said after being declared winner of the event.

President, Work and Play, Adeoye Ojuoko, said, “This year’s edition was quite different, we were able to have a well-established off-road challenge that was well controlled, minimised all forms of risk as well as tailored to international standard.

“This is the track for any racer willing to test his endurance, patience and focus.”

Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola and the Chairman, Elizade Nigeria Limited, Chief Michael Adeojo, were guests at the event.
