Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, has been voted Ligue 1 Player of The Month of September ahead of Algerian forward, Islam Slimani (Monaco) and Nantes’ Nicolas Pallois.

The 20-year-old scored two goals in four league appearances for Lille in September.

He was on target in Lille’s 2-1 win against Angers SCO and the 2-0 victory at home to Strasbourg.

The former Wolfsburg striker, who was named Lille Player of The Month for August and September, has scored seven goals and recorded two assists in nine league appearances for Los Dogues this season.

With the impressive figure, the Nigeria international was also named as the fourth most decisive player of the five major European leagues, with Bayern Munich Robert Lewandowski topping the list and Manchester City duo Sergio Agüero and Kevin De Bruyne finishing second and third respectively.

Osimhen dedicated the award to God.

“Player of the month of September, major thanks to those who voted for me, I appreciate each and everyone of you, special gratitude goes to my family, teammates and my loved ones. God is the greatest. We move,” he tweeted.

Before the award, the Nigerian had written on Instagram, “The goal is to keep improving.”

Lille took to their Twitter handle to celebrate the forward.

“Congratulation to @victorosimhen9, voted player of the month of September @Ligue1 Conforama.

“A big thank you for your votes.”

Osimhen is reportedly a target for Spanish giants Barcelona, following his heroics at Lille.
