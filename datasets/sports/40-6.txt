Slavia Prague will look to transform their dominance in the Fortuna Liga to Wednesday’s cup clash against Ostrava at the Sinobo stadium, says Nigeria international Peter Olayinka’s agent, Olusegun Odusanya.

Jindrich Tripsovsky’s men have had a rollercoaster so far in the league and Europe.

The Eternal Slavia are currently leading the pack in the league on 38 points, with their closest rivals, Viktoria Plazen, nine points behind on 29 points.

While in the Champions League, the capital based outfit have shown gutsy displays against Europe’s heavyweights. A draw against Inter Milan and respectable defeats to Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund sum up the 19-time Czech champions’ season.

It is a momentum they will be taking into the clash against Ostrava at home.

Odusanya in a telephone chat with Sports Extra, believes Olayinka is ready to help the club’s quest in retaining the title.

“It is a tight and busy week for them, but he’s doing well and eager to get on the score sheet for the club on Wednesday.

“They’re having a nice season, their UCL adventure has not been that disastrous but, he is focused on the cup clash against Ostrava, as he is eager to get through the next round,” he stated.

Olayinka has scored six goals in all competitions, grabbing two assists so far this season for the Czech reigning champions.
