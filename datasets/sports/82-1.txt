Berbatov warns Spurs against Mourinho appointment
Former Manchester United and Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov thinks Spurs should not hire Jose Mourinho.

There are rumours suggesting that Mourinho is primed for a return to the Premier League, after he rejected French giants Lyon in the past week.

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is under a bit of pressure after a poor start to the season.

But Berbatov thinks Spurs should persevere with Pochettino.

He told reporters, “Pochettino is the guy that needs to stay there, he’s been there for a long time.

“There has been a lot of talk about Mourinho taking over at Spurs, I think he would have difficulty as well.

“Would he make Spurs better? I don’t know because it is the same team.

“Yes you can have a bit of a lift in the beginning, like Manchester United did when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer came in.

“Then you need to keep going otherwise you are going to slip into a spiral.

“I remember Sir Alex Ferguson telling us a team needs to be changed when four years passes.

“Not the whole team but players. After four years some players start to get complacent and they aren’t challenged.

“They are in with the manager and they are comfortable, so a manager needs to shake things up and bring in new player.

“I was thinking that this could be the case with Spurs, a lot of the players have been there a long time.

“Maybe they need to shake things up and try to push the players in a way.”
