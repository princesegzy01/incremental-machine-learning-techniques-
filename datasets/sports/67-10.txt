Barcelona give Umtiti green light after latest injury absence
Samuel Umtiti is fit again after five weeks out with a foot injury, Barcelona announced on Friday.

Umtiti is available for Barca’s La Liga match away at Eibar on Saturday although he faces a fight to win back his place alongside Gerard Pique in central defence.

The 25-year-old has seen his spot taken by Clement Lenglet for both Barcelona and France following an injury-ravaged 12 months.

Before his latest foot problem, Umtiti sustained an injury to his left knee last year and suffered a relapse in November.

He returned in February and made seven appearances in the second half of last season but is yet to appear for his club this term.

Barcelona said left-back Junior Firpo is also fit again after he recovered from a hamstring strain.
