Technical director of the Nigeria Amputee Football team, Pius Asaba, says the country has all it takes to defeat Angola in their final group game of the Africa Amputee Football Nations Cup on Tuesday (today).

The Special Eagles returned to winning ways on Monday with a 1-0 win over Sierra Leone with Nigeria’s top scorer Kelvin Kingsley’s goal edging their West African counterparts.

The Nigerian team in their opening game of the tournament defeated Liberia 1-0, Cameroon 2-1 before a goalless stalemate against Tanzania on Sunday.

Speaking to The PUNCH ahead of the game, Asaba says there is nothing special about the Angolans that the Special Eagles should be scared of.

The amputee football team will face the hosts and world champions on Tuesday.

He said, “Angola’s amputee football team have no special techniques. The only advantage they have over us is that they have a well-prepared team. The times they defeated us, it was through penalties and that could have gone anyway, but I’m confident that this time we will beat them.”

Asaba stressed that they were yet to receive any allowance from the government for participating in the competition.

“It has not been easy for us; coming to this tournament was self-sponsored and the government has failed to cater for our wellbeing,” he added.

With 10 points from four matches, Nigeria are already through to the semi-finals scheduled for Thursday.
