Underrate us at your peril, Dussuyer warns Eagles
Johnny Edward

Benin head coach Michel Dussuyer has warned the Super Eagles not to underestimate his team ahead of next month’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Nigeria.

The Squirrels had an amazing run at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt, as they reached the quarter-finals, where they were beaten by eventual finalists Senegal. They beat Morocco on penalties in the Round of 16.

Dussuyer’s side also played out a 2-2 draw with Zambia in an international friendly at the Charles de Gaulle Stadium in Porto-Novo 11 days ago.

Justin Shonga scored a brace for Zambia while Adeoti Jordan and Steve Mounie scored a goal each for Benin.

“It’s true people are looking out for us to qualify for the 2021 tournament following our performance in the last tournament, “Dussuyer told sport229.com.

“We have seen our weaknesses and we will work on them so that we can play well in the qualifiers against Nigeria and Sierra Leone.

“We have a good team just like Nigeria and we showed it against Zambia who gave us a tough game.

“Our defenders made mistakes but we managed to come back. Zambia was physically stronger than us but we were mentally strong to manage to come back twice, so we cannot be underrated. We are now working on the qualifiers as we have seen our mistakes.”
