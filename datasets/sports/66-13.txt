Udoh: Eagles can reverse 4-1 deficit against Togo
Kelvin Ekerete

Super Eagles B captain, Mfon Udoh, is confident the team will overturn the 4-1 defeat suffered in the hands of Togo in a first leg, second round qualifying match of the 2020 African Nations Championship, when both teams clash on Saturday (today) at the Agege stadium in Lagos.

Togo thrashed the Eagles 4-1 in the first leg, despite the Eagles scoring first after only eight minutes.

The Togolese also defeated the Eagles 2-1 in their opening game of the 2019 WAFU tournament in Senegal a week later.

Udoh says he his confident the team can overturn the result in their third time of meeting and win well.

“I think we can overturn the 4-1 deficit, if I didn’t think something could be done, I won’t be here ,it’s a great task ahead of us and we all know it, impossibility is nothing,” he told Sports Extra.

The former Enyimba captain believes despite losing twice to Togo within a month, a win and CHAN qualification for the team will have a better feel for the home-based Eagles.

“They have defeated us twice but if we win in Lagos, it will be worse for them and it will cancel their wins. We need to win and qualify. Our opponents will feel they can beat us again after defeating us twice, that’s normal, but the obvious thing is that we can’t be beaten three times by them. We are going to win and we will win well.”

The striker insists that the boys are ready to play for the country and get the needed result.

“Now we need to play for our ego, we have to play for our flag, we have been humiliated before and we can’t let that happen again.”
