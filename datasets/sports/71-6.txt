Sodiq Oyeleke

Super Eagles goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa, says he would love to be in the 2020 African Nations Championship as a gift for his birthday.

He said this while celebrating his 31st birthday on Wednesday.

His wish came as Super Eagles B prepare for Saturday’s 2020 CHAN qualifying battle with the Sparrow Hawks of Togo in Lagos.

“I’ve been getting a lot of birthday greetings, from friends, teammates and fans. So, this weekend we’ll be in Lagos where we play against Togo. My birthday wish is to ensure I help the Eagles qualify for the CHAN tournament,” he told Brila.

Ezenwa, a veteran in the Nigeria Professional Football League, has played for local sides as Ocean Boys, Sunshine Stars, FC Ifeanyi Ubah and Enyimba.

He played a crucial role for Nigeria at the 2018 CHAN early this year where the home-based Super Eagles finished second behind the hosts.
