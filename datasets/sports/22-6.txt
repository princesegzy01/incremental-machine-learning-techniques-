The Nigeria Wrestling Federation has applauded Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, for appointing its president, Daniel Igali, as the Commissioner for Sports.

In a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Umar Lambu, the NWF described Igali’s appointment as a well-deserved one, expressing hope that the erstwhile lawmaker would use his wealth of experience to bring positive changes to sports in the state.

“No doubt your appointment is predicated not only on your wealth of experience being a former vibrant state legislator who stood distinctively among your contemporaries, but is also premised on your enormous contributions towards ensuring an enduring democratic governance in Bayelsa State,” the statement read in part.

“As a world and Olympic champion in wrestling, we have every reason to congratulate you on this important milestone, praying that the Almighty God will give you the wisdom, strength and determination to discharge your duties diligently to justify the confidence reposed in you.”

The seasoned administrator has been at the helm of wrestling in Nigeria since 2013 when he won his first four-year mandate. He was re-elected in 2017.

Under his watch, the sport has witnessed a meteoric rise in fortunes, with Team Nigeria dominating several continental and global competitions.

Before his latest appointment, Igali was a member of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly from 2011 to 2019, and also headed the House Committees on Sports and Agriculture, among other positions of service to his state.
