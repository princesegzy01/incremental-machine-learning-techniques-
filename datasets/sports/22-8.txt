The Sand Eagles will take confidence and pride from their 6-5 win over Brazil at the Copa Lagos Beach Soccer tournament, which ended in Lagos on Sunday and build on it heading into the World Cup in Paraguay, says Super Sand Eagles coach, Audu Ejo.

Nigeria came second behind Senegal, who successfully defended their Copa Lagos title on Sunday after winning all their matches.

The Sand Teranga Lions completed the treble with a 3-2 win over England while the Sand Eagles defeated world champions, Brazil, 6-5 to clinch second position.

Ejo’s charges posted victories against England on match-day one before suffering defeat to defending champions, Senegal, in their second match, but rallied back to secure victory in their last match against Brazil.

Nigeria will be heading to Paraguay for this year’s Beach Soccer World Cup and Ejo believes the win against Brazil will further boost the team’s confidence as they gun for international glory.

“I am impressed with how we played despite the obvious shoddy preparations we had.

“However, we did well to play and fight against some of the best teams in beach soccer. I am happy with the win over Brazil, it says a lot.”

“Beating the world champions is a shot in confidence for the boys. We’ll head to the world cup with renewed belief and confidence in our own abilities,” he told Sports Extra in a telephone conversation.
