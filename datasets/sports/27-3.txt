Enugu Rangers defender, Kehinde Adedipe, is confident of a win in their return leg of the CAF Confederations Cup playoff tie against ASC Kara of Togo at the Nnamdi Azikiwe stadium on Sunday.

The Flying Antelopes’ lack of concentration in stoppage time saw Yendoutie Richard drill a powerful effort into the far post to give the hosts a hard-earned win against the Nigerians heading to the second leg.

Adedipe, who recently joined Rangers from Rivers United, says he is confident of a win at home, having studied their opponents.

“We lost a bit of concentration in the first leg in Togo. I am confident that when they come here it will be a different story.

“We have studied their game and we have worked on ourselves as well. The people of Enugu expect victory and qualification to the group stage and that is what we are going to give them. We know what we are capable of doing,” he told Sports Extra.

Rangers coach, Benedict Ugwu, is also confident of booking a ticket to the group stages.

“We know what we are going to do; we are going to qualify because the type of game they saw away is not the type of game we are going to play in Enugu.”
