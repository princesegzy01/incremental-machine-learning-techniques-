Austin Oladapo scored a brace as Nigeria Professional Football League champions, Enyimba, secured their first win of the 2019/20 season following a 3-1 win over Nasarawa United in a rescheduled fixture.

Oladapo scored the opener for the home side in the 18th minute before Samson Obi made it 2-0 just before half time.

Hamza Owolabi pulled one back for the visitors in the 56th minute from the penalty spot, while Oladapo completed his brace eight minutes from time to move the People’s Elephant to third on the league table after two games.

In other rescheduled games, Akwa United’s wait for a first win of the season continues as they failed to beat Abia Warriors at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium on Thursday following a goalless draw.

However, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Stadium in Enugu, Nnamdi Egbujuo’s 55th minute goal proved decisive as Enugu Rangers piped Sunshine Stars 1-0 to record their first win of the season.

Plateau United and Wikki Tourists are the early log leaders both securing wins in their first two games.
