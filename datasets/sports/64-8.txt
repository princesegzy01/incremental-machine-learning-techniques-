Dennis is fatigued –Clement
Kelvin Ekerete

Club Brugge manager, Philippe Clement, has blamed fatigue for some of his key players, Dennis

Emmanuel, as the reason for his team’s below-par performance in their 1-0 win at Royal Excel Mouscron on Saturday to consolidate their position at the top of the table.

Dennis was in the starting line-up but made way for Lius Openda in the 77th minute.

Reacting to their first game after the international break, Clement attributed their display to the stress of the international break.

“For guys like Dennis and Diatta, they had to travel a lot which is part of today’s soccer.

He said, “That belongs to the globalisation of soccer. Games abroad require indeed a lot of energy but the national calendar is also full. We play two matches a week until the winter break if we go further in the Cup.

“Finding an appropriate balance between enough rest and training sessions for the guys is not an easy task. We will definitely go for it again.”

Brugge welcome PSG in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday and Dennis will be hoping to get on the score sheet again, after his brace against Real Madrid onatch-day one.
