Joshua must knock out Ruiz – Bradley
Timothy Bradley, a former two division world champion, believes Anthony Joshua must go for the knockout when he faces Andy Ruiz in a rematch on December 7th in Saudi Arabia.

In the first bout, back on June 1, Joshua was dropped four times before the contest was waved off in the seventh round in New York City.

Ruiz, who came in as a late replacement and a huge underdog, walked away with the IBF, IBO, WBA, WBO world titles.

Joshua quickly exercised the contractual clause for an immediate rematch, and he vowed to correct his mistakes.

According to Bradley, Joshua should forget about boxing it out to a decision – and go for the KO win.

“He’s got to knock him out. It was a mental thing and it was a fact that he got caught right on the button. It was a fact that he didn’t train like he normally trains for big fights. He possibly took Ruiz lightly in looking at his physique like – ‘oh, he’s nothing,’” Bradley told Fighthype.com.
