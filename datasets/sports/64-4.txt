‘Olayinka will justify Eagles call-up’
Solape Lawal-Solarin

Slavia Prague’s Peter Olayinka made his Super Eagles debut as a late substitute in the recent 1-1 draw against Brazil in an international friendly in Singapore.

But tt isn’t enough for a debutant seeking to make an impression in the green and white jersey, says the player’s agent, Olusegun Odusanya.

“He came on in the 89th minute, it wasn’t enough for him to show what he can do, but I believe he’ll get more chances in the future matches,” he said.

“Now he needs to continue performing well in his club. Once he sustains that, he’ll justify his call-up to the Eagles.

“He only needs to concentrate on his club football.”

The Eternal Slavia are currently at the summit of the Fortuna Liga and are also playing Champions League football this season.

Olayinka has been influential in both campaigns as his four goals in nine league appearances has fortified the capital-based outfit’s position at the top while, his goal against Inter in the Champions League earned them a famous 1-1 draw at the San Siro on match-day one.
