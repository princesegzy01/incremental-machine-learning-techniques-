Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr will release his squad list of 23 players for their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho this week, the spokesperson of the Nigerian Football Federation, Ademola Olajire, has said.

“The list is expected to be released sometime this week with the game billed for November 13 at a venue yet to be ratified by the federation,” Olajire told Sports Extra.

The venues being considered to host the game against Benin are the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba and the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo.

Sports Extra also gathered that Rohr will keep faith with Granada midfielder Ramon Azeez and Slavia Prague’s Peter Olayinka for the game.

The Franco-German is also expected to name Kenneth Omeruo, Ola Aina and Samuel Kalu for the game. The trio missed the Eagles’ last game due to injuries.

Also expected to make the squad list barring any last-minute injury are Wilfred Ndidi, Joe Aribo, Chidozie Awaziem, Jamilu Collins, William Troost-Ekong, Alex Iwobi, Moses Simon, Samuel Chukwueze and Semi Ajayi.

It remains to be seen if Rohr will recall his captain Ahmed Musa for the game after the 27-year-old returned to training recently from a knee injury.
