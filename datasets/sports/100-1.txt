Ex-international, Jonathan Akpoborie, says Chelsea players, Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori, pledging their allegiance to England is not a loss to Nigeria as there are talented players who can easily take their place in the national team.

England coach, Gareth Southgate, extended call-ups to the players after their impressive UEFA Champions League match against French side Lille on Wednesday ending months of speculation about the future of the players, who were also eligible to play for Nigeria.

Reacting to their call up, the former Nigerian international says there are other players in the Eagles who can do better than the Chelsea players.

“It is not a loss to the country, we need to organise our football so players like that can respect us more. Plus we have promising players like Victor Osimhen who we saw in the Champions League on Wednesday,” he said.

Abraham and Tomori have been in superb form for Chelsea this season with the striker scoring seven league goals for the Blues and Tomori scoring once.
