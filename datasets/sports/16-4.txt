No fewer than 13,000 women are expected to run against domestic violence and girl-child abuse on Saturday in Lagos.

Coordinator of Lagos Women Run, Tayo Popoola, said this on Tuesday, while participants of the programme trooped out in hundreds to collect their running kits at the Teslim Balogun Stadium.

According to her, the wife of the Lagos State Governor, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, will commence the 10km run starting at the Tafawa Balewa Square at 7am and end at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere.

While the winner will get a cash prize of N750, 000, the first and second runners-up will be rewarded with N500, 000 and N300, 000 respectively.

She said, “The run will showcase 15 of the various historical monuments in Lagos State. This year, we want to run against domestic violence and girl-child abuse. It is one of the ways we can correct the system. What is happening now, when it comes to women violence is becoming an everyday affair.

“We need to address this and assist the system. We believe that reducing it will bring peace to the country. For Lagos Women Run, we just feel that for the government to have peace, they need to address areas like violence against the girl-child and abuses against women. When a woman is happy, the home is happy and when the home is happy, the country is happy.”

She explained that security and other logistics to make the run successful would be handled by different agencies in Lagos State.
