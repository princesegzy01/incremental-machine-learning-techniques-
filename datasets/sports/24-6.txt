Johnny Edward

Eberechi Eze has been rated as the English Championship’s best player for the month of October 2019 by statistical website WhoScored.com.

The 21-year-old’s displays during October earned him a WhoScored.com rating of 7.95 for the month, with the second-highest-rated player being Luton Town midfielder Izzy Brown (7.64).

Eze was in sparkling form during October, scoring three times in five matches as Mark Warburton’s R’s picked up seven points from a possible 15.

The 21-year-old netted in the club’s victories during October, against Blackburn Rovers at Kiyan Prince Foundation Stadium and away at Hull City.

In particular, his performance at Hull caught the eye. Eze won the R’s two second-half penalties – scoring both of them himself – as they came from behind to earn the victory in Yorkshire.

Meanwhile, Mark Warburton has singled out one of his Eze’s performances against Leeds United on Saturday for praise.

QPR lost 2-0 at table-topping Leeds United.

“It’s a very tight league, we know the quality they possess but so do we,”Warburton told QPR’s official website.

“I thought the best player on the pitch was Eze, I thought he was outstanding.”
