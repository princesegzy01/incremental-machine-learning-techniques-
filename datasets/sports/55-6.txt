UCL: Salah may return against Genk
Liverpool will resume their search for an elusive away Champions League group stage win on Wednesday night when they take on Genk at the Luminus Arena and will hope Mohamed Salah returns.

It has been a topsy-turvy start to Liverpool’s sixth European Cup/Champions League defence, with defeat in Naples on matchday one being followed by a remarkable game against Red Bull Salzburg at Anfield.

The Reds seemed to be cruising after scoring three goals in the opening 36 minutes, only for Salzburg to pull off the type of comeback their hosts have become renowned for by restoring parity on the hour mark.

Mohamed Salah’s winner 21 minutes from time was greeted with huge relief around the stadium, particularly considering it was Liverpool’s home form which carried them through the group stages en route to the title last season.

Indeed, Jurgen Klopp’s side travel to Belgium looking to end a run of four successive away defeats at this stage of the competition, while a 7-0 drubbing of Maribor in 2017 is their only win in their last 10 such games.

Of course, there has been away glory in Europe further down the line having reached the last two finals, but they will hope to make their progress to those latter stages easier this time around with victory on Wednesday night.
