Mbappe dreams Real move – Zidane
Zinedine Zidane has hinted Kylian Mbappe will join Real Madrid in the future.

“He always said his dream was to play at Real Madrid.”

Earlier this week, Marca cited a report from Le Parisien which claimed Paris Saint-Germain will offer Mbappe a new contract on ‘Neymar levels’ with an annual net salary of €40m.

This comes in the wake of fresh reports that Madrid have set aside €300m to land the France international, following a plethora of coverage that he is their long-term transfer objective.

“It is he who will decide on his future,” Zidane told a press conference, as cited by Marca.

“For the moment he is with PSG. We will see in the future. He always said that his dream was to play at Real Madrid one day.”

AS Monaco president Vadim Vasilyev revealed this weekend: “Mbappe has told me of his desire to go to Real Madrid.”

El Chiringuito reported in September that Madrid have already paid €35m plus a further €5m in variables for the deal, with a total payment of €225m plus €50m in variables, in what was an outlandish claim.

The 20-year-old striking sensation scooped the Ligue 1 player of the year award for last season and hinted that he could be open to a move to another club, with Madrid strongly linked.
