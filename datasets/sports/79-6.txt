Solape Lawal-Solarin With Agency Report

Arsenal’s latest gem, Bukayo Saka, is still not allowed into the first-team dressing room at the club’s training ground despite his impressive showings for the North London club’s first team.

The young winger, 18, has still not been given permission to join the senior dressing room – and continues to prepare in the academy area.

Saka has made five appearances for the Gunners this season, including three Premier League run-outs.

The hot prospect, tipped for big things at the Emirates, even scored in the Europa League win over Eintracht Frankfurt, while adding two assists.

Saka has gone up against Aston Villa, Manchester United and Bournemouth.

Despite rapidly becoming a big part of Unai Emery’s plans, Saka is yet to be given full first-team privileges.

The training facilities at Arsenal are separated into first-team and academy wings – and youngsters must be invited to join in with the established stars.
