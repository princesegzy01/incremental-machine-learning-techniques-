Everton star, Alex Iwobi, is already a darling of his manager, Marco Silva, after posting another impressive display in the Toffees’ 2-0 win over Watford in the Carabao Cup fourth round clash. He has also been tipped by the Portuguese to play more prominent roles in their next fixtures.

The Toffees put behind a bitter and controversial 3-2 loss to Brighton away in the premier league to zoom into the next round at the expense of a wobbling Hornets’ side coached by Quique Flores.

Iwobi has settled in well at Everton since completing a £34m switch from Arsenal, going on to win over the Merseyside faithfuls with his displays.

And against Watford, Iwobi’s second half performance excited Silva who in turn heaped positive comments on the Nigeria international in a post-match chat with the club’s website.

“He (Iwobi) is in a good moment and will help us in the next games as well.

“The way we built our attacks (after half-time) was faster and the gaps were clearer. We found the spaces more easily.

“Alex Iwobi was different in the second half, he found the spaces and created more between the lines and was more decisive.”
