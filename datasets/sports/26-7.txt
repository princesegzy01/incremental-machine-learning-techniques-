Stoke City midfielder, Oghenekaro Etebo, has expressed disappointment on missing out on the opportunity to face his international teammate Semi Ajayi when West Bromich Albion play against Stoke City on Monday in the Championship.

Etebo, who is injured and unable to take part in the fixture, has nothing but respect for Ajayi, but said he would have loved to face him again, having done that twice when the Potters battled his former club, Rotherham United.

“He is always very hard working in training when we are in camp,” Etebo told ESPN.

“I would say that 95 per cent of the time, we are almost always on the same side in training and I can see how much work he is doing.

“The few times that we play against each other, we win almost the same number of interceptions and tackles. So I would say that there is not much difference between us.”

On missing out on the opportunity to face Ajayi, Etebo said.

“I would have loved to play against him this week.

“We played against each other twice when he was at Rotherham and it was a draw. I am disappointed not to be able to face him in his new club.”

“This time, I will be there as a fan supporting my team and I wish him well and hope he has a good game, but I am sure why team will win, so he will go home disappointed with the result but I hope he plays well,” he concluded.
