Rohr: Why I make late substitutions

Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has lifted the lid on why he makes late substitutions in games.

The German has been accused of not making prompt use of his substitutions, only ringing changes towards the latter stages.

Rohr, however, disclosed his decision was to ensure he does not make mistakes and gives ample time for the players in the starting XI to make an impact.

“I always try to give the starting XI enough time to express themselves,” Rohr told the media.

“I also have to be very sure that the player I want to take off has done all he can during his time on the field of play.”
