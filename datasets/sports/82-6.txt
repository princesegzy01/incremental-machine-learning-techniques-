Ajagba eyes 12th career win
Kelvin Ekerete

Unbeaten Nigerian heavyweight sensation, Efe Ajagba, will engage Belgian, Jack Mulowayi, in a 10-round bout on October 26.

The bout replaces the previously announced Rauâ€™Shee Warren versus Emmanuel Rodriguez fight. Warren had to withdraw from the contest due a right hand injury suffered in sparring.

Ajagba (11-0, 9 KOs) most recently passed the toughest test of his pro career when he defeated fellow 2016 Olympian Ali Eren Demirezen by a 10-round unanimous decision in July.

Mulowayi (7-1-1, 3 KOs) will make his US debut on October 26 in a pro career that dates back to 2015.

The 32-year-old was unbeaten in his first seven pro fights before losing a narrow majority decision to Herve Bubeaux in a bout for the Belgium heavyweight title in May. He then defeat Artur Kubiak in July, heading into his fight against Ajagba.

The bout is an under card before the super welterweight clash between contender Erickson Lubin and hard-hitting Nathaniel Gallimore.
