Barcelona are reportedly ready to launch a bid to sign PSV’s Donyell Malen ahead of Victor Osimhen as they attempt to provide competition for Luis Suarez.

The Blaugrana are in search of an ideal replacement for Luis Saurez, who has two years left on his contract at Camp Nou.

Osimhen is one of the four players on the radar of Barcelona, according to Spanish sports newspaper, AS.

The 20-year-old Osimhen is the leading scorer in the French Ligue 1 with seven goals and two assists in nine games for Lille this season.

Other players on the shopping list of Barcelona are Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan) and Rafael Leao (AC Milan).

Malen joined PSV from Arsenal for £500,000 in 2017.
