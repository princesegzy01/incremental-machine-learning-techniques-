David Okereke is happy with his goal-scoring form and hopes to keep the momentum when Brugge take on Gent on Sunday (today).

Phillip Clement’s troops sit atop the league on 20 points, a point ahead of Standard Liege who sit in second spot.

The 23-year-old, who already has four goals in nine appearances for the 15-time Belgian champions, is hoping to sustain the momentum when they host the third-place visitors.

“I feel good, no pressure at all. I know football has its difficult and smooth moments, but I am lucky to be enjoying the good times now.

“I am calm and working hard and hopefully show that on Sunday.

“We are prepared for Gent, it will be nice to secure another win,” he told Sports Extra in a telephone chat.
