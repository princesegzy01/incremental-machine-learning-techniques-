Cecilia Nku’s second minute penalty was all Rivers Angels needed to win the 2019 Nigeria Women’s Premier League title against a determined Confluence Queens side in Lagos on Sunday.

At a packed final that had Sports Minister Sunday Dare and Women Affairs Minister Mrs Pauline Tallen in attendance at the Agege Stadium, the match lived up to expectations as the fans were thrilled with entertaining football from both sides.

Precious Christopher briefly gave Confluence Queens hope in the 14th minute when her penalty hit the woodwork after Amaechi Ojini handled the ball inside the box.

The victory gave Edwin Okon’s side their seventh title, having won the league last in 2016.

“We worked hard for this and deserve to win, Confluence Queens gave us a lot of fight, but we remained resolute and defended well. This victory means a lot to me and my players,” Okon said.

Queens coach Whyte Ogbonda, who had failed to win with Rivers Angels in three consecutive finals, was unhappy with the result, but promised to keep fighting.

“I am not happy with the result today, I thought we deserved a better result from what we got. We were unlucky to lose a penalty when we should have scored. We go back to Lokoja with a heavy heart and definitely we won’t relent on this success we recorded.”

In the third place game, Bayelsa Queens won 4-0 against Adawama Queens.

The winner of the 2019 NWPL will go home with N3m and one week tour to Spain as part of the Laliga/NWFL partnership deal.
