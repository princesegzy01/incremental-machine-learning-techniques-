Osimhen too fast for Chelsea – Lampard
Johnny Edward

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has praised Victor Osimhen following his all-round performance against the Blues in Wednesday’s Champions League clash at the Stade Pierre Mauroy, Sports Extra reports.

Osimhen scored his first UCL goal for Lille in the 33rd minute, cancelling out Tammy Abraham’s opener 10 minutes earlier.

The strike took Osimhen’s tally to seven in 10 games for Lille in all competitions for Christophe Galtier’s side.

Willian volleyed in Callum Hudson-Odoi’s cross 12 minutes from time to earn Chelsea their first win in the competition this season.

“Osimhen was very impressive, it was a very difficult game for our defenders,” Lampard told a post-match conference.

“He’s so fast and solid. I wish him a great career.

“He overcame malaria and that is what’s inspiring about him. He had a good game.”

Chelsea will face Ajax away on matchday 3 in Amsterdam while Lille hosts Valencia. Both games will be played October 23.
