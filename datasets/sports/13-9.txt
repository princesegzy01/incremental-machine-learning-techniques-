Premier League club, Leicester City, are ready to table an offer believed to be around €23m for Nigeria and Club Brugge striker Emmanuel Dennis.

Dennis has been on the radar of Brendan Rodgers for a while and has been identified as the man to partner England forward, Jamie Vardy upfront.

According to voetbal24.be, the Foxes have opened negotiations with Brugge ahead of a potential move in the January transfer window despite Brugge’s unwillingness to sell the forward in the next transfer window.

The report also adds that the Belgian outfit are likely to demand €23m for Dennis’ signature.

“Despite the fact that Club Brugge would prefer not to sell Dennis before the end of this season, Leicester City continues to insist,” the website reads.

“The English subtopper sees Dennis as an ideal competitor for Jamie Vardy and would like to sign the Nigerian in January.”
