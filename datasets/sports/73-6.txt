Struggling Iwobi better than Pepe
Johnny Edward

Everton forward Alex Iwobi has been criticised for his form this season – but he’s been more prolific than Nicolas Pepe, Sports Extra reports.

Iwobi joined Everton on deadline day this summer from Arsenal for £40m following the arrival of Pepe from Lille for a fee of £72m.

Statistics, however, show that Iwobi has a better minutes-per-goal-ratio than that of the Arsenal winger, who is believed by many to have taken the Nigerian’s place when he departed the Emirates in the summer.

Iwobi has scored two goals in eight games, playing a total of 558 minutes.

That gives him a minutes-per-goal ratio of 172, compared to Pepe’s 560.

The Arsenal winger has netted one goal in 10 appearances scoring once and providing three assists, playing 614 minutes.
