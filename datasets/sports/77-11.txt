The Super Eagles on Sunday got accolades from football fans, including the Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, after their 1-1 draw against Brazil in their international friendly in Singapore.

Also, former Nigeria midfielder, Mutiu Adepoju, described the Eagles’ performance as brave.

Eagles took the lead after 35 minutes when Joe Aribo found space in a packed penalty box to rifle in a low shot past Manchester City’s Ederson.

Brazil equalised three minutes into the second half when Casemiro fired home from close range, after he was quickest to react when a Marquinhos header came back off the woodwork.

Reacting to the outcome of the game, Dare commended the Eagles for their commitment.

He tweeted, “Great game of football! Ended in a one-all draw. Our boys were gallant and showed incredible commitment and industry against a star-studded Brazilian team.

“The current crops of players in the Super Eagles are bankable and we will do everything to keep them together and united! Well done! We have a dream team and we should keep them together. Young team (with an) average age of 23 years.”

Adepoju classified Eagles draw against Brazil as a win, urging them to grab the lessons from the match.

“Well-done brave Eagles! This draw looks like a win and I believe this is a sign of good things to come for our senior national team. Also, there are lots of lessons to take home against Brazil and that is very important,” he added.

Among the players hailed by the fans are Aribo, Francis Uzoh and Winfred Ndidi.
