Kante’s return boost for Lampard
Defeat brought Chelsea’s seven-match winning streak to an end, but manager Frank Lampard hopes for a boost with the return to training of N’Golo Kante.

The France midfielder has endured an injury-hit start to the season and had not figured for almost a month.

“He is hopefully going to join in training in the next two or three days,” said Lampard. “Hopefully he will be back before the international break.

“I would have liked to have given Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic a rest because of the work they are putting in. I couldn’t because of N’Golo, Ross (Barkley), and Ruben (Loftus-Cheek) is long term.

“I couldn’t make those changes I wanted to but it is what it is I suppose.”
