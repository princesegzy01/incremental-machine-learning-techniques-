Nigeria and Barcelona forward, Asisat Oshoala, scored twice on Saturday as FC Barcelona femini beat Madrid 4-0 at the Estadio Municipal Nuevo Matapiñonera.

The Nigeria international stole the show in Madrid with a woman-of-the-match display.

A goal in each half from Oshoala plus Jennifer Hermoso’s strike guided Barcelona past Víctor Fernández’s side in a Spanish Primera Iberdrola encounter.

Oshoala broke the deadlock for Llius Cortes’ ladies in 43rd minutes before getting the second immediately after the restart in the second half.

In the 73rd minute, Hansen provided her third assist of the match as Jenni Hermoso netted the third for Barca before substitute Aitana Bonmati scored two minutes from time to seal the victory.

Oshoala, who was in action for 68 minutes before being replaced by Bonmati, has now scored in five successive games for Barcelona and has eight goals in 11 games in all competitions this season.

Her brace also saw her move into second spot on the scoring chart with seven goals from seven league games – one behind her teammate Hermoso who scored her eighth in the contest.

Meanwhile, her compatriot Chidinma Okeke suffered a potentially serious injury as she was taken off in tears in the 25th minutes and was replaced by Laura Teruel.
