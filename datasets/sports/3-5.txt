Super Eagles forward Kelechi Iheanacho is set for a loan move when the January transfer window reopens.

The 23-year-old Nigeria international has not made an appearance for the Foxes in the EPL this season but has scored twice in the Carabao Cup.

According to HITC, Brendan Rodgers is looking for a quality back-up option to Jamie Vardy who has scored 11 goals so far this for the Foxes and doesn’t rate Iheanacho as one.

“Expect Kelechi Iheanacho to be loaned out and a new frontman to be brought in,” the report revealed.

Glasgow Rangers striker Alfredo Morelos and Club Brugges forward Emmanuel Dennis have been linked with a move to the King Power stadium.

The 23-year-old joined Leicester City in summer 2017 and has made 64 appearances for the club netting just 11 times.
