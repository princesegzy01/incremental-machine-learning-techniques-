Rob Holding lauds Martinelli, says he’s a nightmare to defenders
English professional footballer who plays as a centreback for Premier League club Arsenal, Rob Holding, trains alongside teenage player Gabriel Martinelli every day, and says he has his hands full trying to contain him.

“He’s come in and settled really well,” the defender said.

“In training every day, he works hard. He puts you under pressure constantly and never stops running, which, as a centre half, is a nightmare.

“You want a striker that will sort of give up on you, but he never gives up,” Holding has said of Martinelli, as stated in a Press release on Arsenal’s website on Wednesday.

“His finishing has been unbelievable, even with his head. He’s only a small guy but the headed goals he’s scored in the Forest game and the Standard Liege game have been incredible goals, to be fair to him.

“I think he’s really close with Emi Martinez,” he added. “He spends a lot of time with him and I think he’s translating for him as he picks up English.

“In yoga, he is trying to learn as much English as he can. It’s only a small group of five or six of us, so he’s learning English as he goes along and he’s making an effort, which is important.”
