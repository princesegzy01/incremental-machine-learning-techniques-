Saka will be a star, says Arsenal legend

Former Arsenal legend, Charlie Nicholas, is confident that English footballer of Nigerian descent Bukayo Saka is going to be a star at the Emirates, but suggested that he should not yet be a regular starter in Arsenal’s attack.

Saka has started the Gunners’ last four Premier League games this season and the 18-year-old has been hugely impressive.

He scored one and provided two assists in his one Europa League appearance.

He also provided a superb assist in the 1-1 draw with Manchester United last month. But his presence in the team has prompted Nicholas to criticise Unai Emery despite the pundit insisting that the youngster is going right to the top.

“He’s picking strange attacking formations at the moment. I like Saka. He’s going to be a star,” he told Sky Sports.

“But at the moment, when Lacazette’s fit, it’s Lacazette, Aubameyang and Pepe. He’s got to do more or else, he’ll be left out. And Ceballos behind them. That’s the front four.”

Saka came off the bench to replace Granit Xhaka in the 61st minute as the Gunners threw away a two-goal lead to draw with Crystal Palace at the Emirates.
