Real Madrid vs Granada: Marcelo to miss table-top clash
Left-back Marcelo will miss league leaders Real Madrid’s La Liga match against second-placed Granada this weekend due to a leg injury, the Spanish giants said on Friday.

Brazilian Marcelo, 31, only made his return from a neck injury in Tuesday’s 2-2 draw with Club Brugge having missed four games earlier in the season.

The announcement leaves coach Zinedine Zidane without a recognised left-back for Saturday’s league fixture with France defender Ferland Mendy suffering from a calf problem.
