Injured De Bruyne out of Belgium Euro 2020 qualifiers squad
Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne was left out of Belgium’s squad for their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers due to a groin injury, coach Roberto Martinez announced on Friday.

De Bruyne, 28, missed City’s midweek Champions League win over Dinamo Zagreb after suffering the injury in the Premier League victory over Everton on September 28.

Former captain Vincent Kompany and Lyon defender Jason Denayer also miss out due to fitness issues.

There are doubts about goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, forward Romelu Lukaku and defender Thomas Meunier with Martinez saying a decision about the three will be made on Monday.

Martinez added he was “relatively optimistic” about Courtois who was replaced at half-time in Real Madrid’s 2-2 draw with Club Brugge on Tuesday due to a stomach problem.
