Ndidi dismisses Vardy’s coaching prospect

Foxes hit-man, Jamie Vardy, won’t make a good manager in the dugout, going by the hysterical reaction of Super Eagles defender, Wilfred Ndidi.

The AFCON bronze medalist spoke highly of his manager, Brendan Rodgers, but is unsure of Foxes teammate, Vardy’s managerial skills when asked by a Sky Sports reporter.

Vard, who was crowned the Premier League Player of the Month for October, has been in imperious form for the Foxes this season with his 10 league goals propelling the KingPower outfit to third on the league table.

Despite his goal-poaching instincts, Ndidi, however, in an interview with Sky Sports, reacted hysterically to the idea of seeing the England international as a future manager.

“The manager (Brendan) is experienced, he knows the job.

“But Vards, I don’t know, I don’t know about Vards being a manager,” as he laughed hysterically while shaking his head.

Wilfred Ndidi is one of Leicester’s important first team figures. The Nigeria international has settled in well ever since completing a £17m move from Genk in 2017.

Highly rated for his ball recovery abilities, hard-tackling style and solidity, Ndidi has seen his stock shot up at Leicester.

Ndidi has scored two goals in 10 league appearances for the Leicester based side this season.
