The kick-off of the Nigeria Women Pro-League Competition has been postponed by one week, in honour of two Nigeria Women’s Football League players, Aniebet Ekong and Glory Saturday, who lost their lives in an auto crash on Tuesday.

The players, who are members of the Police Machine FC, died on the spot after being hit by a hit-and-run driver, after their training on Tuesday evening.

In a condolence letter on Thursday, the board of the NWFL said the league would now hold between October 7 and 11.

The letter, which was signed by the Chief Operating Officer of the NWFL, Ayo Abdulrahman, read in part, “We collectively commiserate and grieve with you, the entire officials and crew of the club.

“Due to the sad incident that happened in Uyo, AkwaIbom State on October 1, where two players of the Police Female Machine FC lost their lives, the NWFL Pro-League 2018/2019 season earlier scheduled between October 3 and 7, in Lokoja, Kogi State has been postponed to now hold between October 7 and 11 at same venue.”

Meanwhile, Osun Babes of Osogbo and Dream Stars of Lagos have both retained their spots in the NWPL.
