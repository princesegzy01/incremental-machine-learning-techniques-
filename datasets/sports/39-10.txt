Gunners to hold Xhaka talks after outburst
Arsenal will meet with captain Granit Xhaka in the next few days to discuss his angry reaction to being substituted during Sunday’s 2-2 home draw with Crystal Palace.

Xhaka is due to return to training on Tuesday ahead of Arsenal’s Carabao Cup fourth-round tie against Liverpool, live on Sky Sports on Wednesday.

The Football Association will not be taking any action against Xhaka after he was seen swearing and gesturing to Arsenal fans as he was booed off.

Xhaka, who has conceded more fouls (22) than any other Premier League player this season, has been substituted in three of the nine Premier League matches he has featured in this term.

It is not known at this stage whether Arsenal are considering removing the captain’s armband from Xhaka.

Asked after the game if Xhaka would remain Arsenal captain, boss Unai Emery said, “Now is not the time to talk about that.”
