D’Tigress coach Otis Hughley has revealed that the reigning AfroBasket champions are well prepared to face DR Congo later today at the Pavilhao do Mazaquene in Maputo, Mozambique.

The African pre-qualifiers for the 2020 Tokyo Games will take place from November 14 to 17 in Maputo and Africa’s top ranked team, D’Tigress, have been drawn in Group A alongside hosts Mozambique and DR Congo.

Speaking from the team’s base in Maputo, Hughley confirmed that the players are ready to give their best when they start their pre-qualifiers campaign.

“We are aware of the task ahead of us,” Hughley was quoted as saying in a media statement from the Nigeria Basketball Federation.

“The culture of basketball is fast growing in Nigeria and the people are expecting us to win every time we file out. These expectations have continued to spur us to want to give our all and represent the country the best that we can.

“We must continue to show the world that we deserved to be the best in Africa and also become one of the best in the world.”
