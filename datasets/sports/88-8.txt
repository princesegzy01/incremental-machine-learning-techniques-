Super Falcons defender, Chidinma Okeke, feels hurt over the Nigerian women national team’s failure to qualify for the 2020 Olympics.

The Madrid CFF player made her feelings known in a tweet on Tuesday.

According to her, playing in the Olympics was one of her dreams.

She said, “Crashing out of the Olympic race leaves a bad taste in our mouths. It hurts most because it’s the dream of every sportsmen and women to play at the Olympic Games.”

Super Falcons played a 1-1 draw with their Ivorian counterparts at the Agege Township Stadium on Monday but crashed out on the away goal rule, after the reverse fixture in Abidjan ended 0-0.

The match started with the Ivorians drawing the first blood in the 12th minute through Kapho Zole Nina, while Falcons captain, Asisat Oshoala’s solo effort in the 34th minute gave them the equaliser.

The Ivorians, with a perfect game plan, however, thwarted Falcons’ efforts to get the winning goal.

The loss ensured that the nine-time African champions will miss the party at the Olympics for three consecutive times, London 2010, Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020.
