Tennis: Murray wins first ATP title since 2017
Andy Murray won his first ATP title since March 2017 on Sunday with a battling 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Stan Wawrinka in the Antwerp final.

Former world number one Murray, rebuilding his game after career-saving hip surgery earlier this year, fought back from a set and 3-1 down against fellow three-time Grand Slam champion Wawrinka to claim his 46th career title.
