CHAN: Eagles to play Togo in Agege
Ebenezer Bajela

The Agege Stadium, Lagos will host the return leg of the 2020 African Nations Championship final qualifier between Nigeria and Togo scheduled for October 19.

The Super Eagles B will be looking to turn around a 4-1 deficit suffered from the first-leg played at the Stade de Kegue, Lome last month.

Coach Imama Amapakabo is faced with a tough task, knowing that his side must score at least three goals without conceding to go through, and has extended invitation to eight new players in order to strengthen the team ahead of the crunch tie.

Goalkeeper Ikechukwu Ezenwa, who was an unused substitute in the Eagles friendly game against Brazil on Sunday, is one of the players invited.

Kano Pillars duo Ifeanyi Nweke and Nyima Nwangwua; Enyimba defender, Ifeanyi Aneamena; Enugu Rangersâ€™ midfielder Anthony Shimanga; Katsina duo Destiny Ashadi and Ibrahim Olawoyin complete the list of the additional players.
