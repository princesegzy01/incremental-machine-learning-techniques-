Kelvin Ekerete

Super Eagles and Leicester City combative midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has been listed in English Premier League Team of The Week by popular statistics website, whoscored.com.

Ndidi is one of Leicester’s three players in the list. Others are Ricardo Pereira and in-form midfielder, James Maddison.

Their selection came after the Foxes’ 2-0 win over Arsenal on Saturday.

Ndidi almost got his name on the scorer’s sheet but his first half effort hit the woodwork against the Gunners.

In a 4-4-2 formation, the Nigerian international is in midfield alongside teammate Maddison, who has scored more goals from outside the box than any other player in the Premier League this season (three).

Also in midfield are Wolves’ Adama Traoré and Burnley’s Dwight McNeil. The forward players include Watford’s Gerard Deulofeu and Wolves’ Raúl Jiménez.

Watford’s goalkeeper, Ben Foster, was adjudged the weekend’s best shot stopper, while the defence have the quartet of Burnley duo Ben Mee and James Tarkowski, Everton’s Lucas Digne and Leicester’s Ricardo Pereira.
