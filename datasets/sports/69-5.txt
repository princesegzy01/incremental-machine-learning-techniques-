Lacazette back in training, could face Sheffield
Alexandre Lacazette has returned to full training and could make his Arsenal comeback as early as Monday’s trip to Sheffield United.

Striker Lacazette has missed Arsenal’s last seven games due to a niggling ankle problem.

The 28-year-old had been struggling with the issue for ‘several weeks’ when Arsenal confirmed in mid-September that he needed to be taken out of the firing line.

His absence increased the burden on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Arsenal’s only other senior striker, though he responded by scoring five times while his strike partner was out.

The Gabon frontman was also named September’s player of the month after scoring in each of his Arsenal appearances during the month.

The Gunners will continue to assess Lacazette over the next few days before making a call on whether he is ready to play a part in their trip to Bramall Lane.

Meanwhile, winger Reiss Nelson will be out until next month due to the left knee ligament injury he suffered against Standard Liege at the start of this month.
