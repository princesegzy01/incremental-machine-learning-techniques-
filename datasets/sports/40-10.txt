AS Monaco striker Henry Onyekuru is set to make a return to the pitch following his injury before the international break, which saw him miss two weeks of action for The Reds and Whites.

Onyekuru was left out of the squad against Rennes a fortnight ago and was not deemed fit enough to play as Monaco defeated Moses Simon’s Nantes 1-0 away from home on Friday at the Stade de la Beaujoire.

Jardim in his press conference ahead of Wednesday clash with Marseille said that he is going to rotate about half the team which means Nigeria international, Henry Onyekuru, could return back to the team.

Jardim in his press conference said, “We’ll rotate about half the team. We have a valuable squad; the season is long and we need everyone.”

The 22-year-old as a result of the injury and paper work was ruled out of Nigeria’s friendly game against Brazil in Singapore earlier this month.
