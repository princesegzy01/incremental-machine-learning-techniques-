Five-time world champions Golden Eaglets suffered a 2-1 defeat to Brazilian club Sao Paolo FCâ€™s U-17 side in their pre-World Cup friendly on Monday.

The Eaglets fell behind in the 18th minute through a goal from Danilo Silva but the Eaglets unleashed a series of attacks in search of an equaliser.

Unfortunately, Ibrahim Mohammed and striker Olakunle Olusegun failed to convert the chances that were created from the midfield.

Peter Ukeme, who appeared not physicially fit, was replaced after 35 minutes by Akinkunmi Amoo, and the introduction of the stocky attacking midfielder presented a big threat to the Brazilians, as the first half ended with Nigeria trailing 1-0.

The Nigerians eventually drew level, thanks to a well-taken 70th minute spot-kick by Olusegun.

But Enrique Santos snatched the winner for Sao Paolo in the 85th minute with a sublime finish.

The Eagles will seek redemption on Wednesday (today) in their second warm-up game against South Korea, as the big kick-off approaches.

Nigeria are the most successful team at the U-17 cadre and will be hoping to dethrone reigning champions England when the competition finally kicks off on October 26.
