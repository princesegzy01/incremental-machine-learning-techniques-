Chess: I will keep fighting hard, says Ajibola

Winner at the just-concluded National Friends of Chess tournament, Ajibola Olanrewaju, has said he was intimidated by young players heading into the competition, which took place at Chevron Recreation Centre, Gbagada, Lagos.

Ajibola told our correspondent that he would continue to fight hard and prove to people that “chess is not a game meant for only the youths.”

Ajibola, 44, who won the over 2000 category, added that winning the NFOC tournament was the last thing on his mind having just won the Richard Asibor Memorial Festival tournament weeks before.

“To be honest, I didn’t think I was going to win the tournament back-to-back despite being tipped to win it. It was quite challenging because I defeated all the top ranked players to win the tournament. I defeated Daniel Anwuli, Abdulrahman and Femi Balogun.

“I am not as young as those players I mentioned because chess is seen as a game for the youths. Because they are young, I thought they were going to defeat me. But I’m sure that their youthfulness will come to play very soon; until then I will keep telling them that I am the tormentor of the youths.

“But until then I want to keep catching fun and doing well,” he said.

The 44-year-old with FIDE ID 8500940 is currently ranked number three in Nigeria and could move to the top spot to dethrone Anwuli in the next ranking to be release.
