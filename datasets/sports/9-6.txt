CAF Confederation Cup draw postponed to Tuesday
The CAF Confederation Cup group draw scheduled for Sunday has been postponed to Tuesday at the Cairo offices of the Confederation of African Football.

A CAF statement confirmed that the draw for the second-tier competition would take place at 1200 local time (1000 GMT), but did not explain the 48-hour delay.

The seeded draw will divide the 16 survivors from three qualifying rounds into four groups with the winners and runners-up progressing to the quarter-finals.
