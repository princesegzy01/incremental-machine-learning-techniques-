LAFFMATAZZ! Gunners’ players openly mock Emery
Unai Emery is in danger of losing the Arsenal dressing room, with a number of players reportedly still perplexed by their manager and openly mocking him.

The Gunners have struggled on the pitch in recent weeks, losing away to Sheffield United, drawing at home to Crystal Palace despite leading by two goals and forfeiting another lead in their Carabao Cup exit against Liverpool on Wednesday.

As well as troubling results on the pitch, Arsenal have also been dealing with the fallout from captain Granit Xhaka’s clash with fans and there are serious question marks over Emery’s handling of the situation.

Pressure is growing on the Spanish coach, with performances well below expectations amid some rather strange tactical and personnel decisions, though he still has the support of the Arsenal board. The mood is slightly different among the players, though, with The Independent reporting that some members of the squad are now ‘mercilessly taking the p***’ out of Emery.

Some of the younger players are even doing impressions of their manager, who has become a bit of a comedy figure for always starting interviews and press conferences with, ‘good ebening’.
