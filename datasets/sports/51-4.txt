Osimhen: I’m addicted to Drogba videos

Ligue 1 rave of the moment, Victor Osimhen, says Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, is his idol and intends to mould his game around the former Ivorian international.

Drogba joined Chelsea from Marseille for £24m in 2004, played 254 times in his nine-year spell, scoring 104 goals, lifting for EPL titles, four FA Cups, three Football League Cups, two Community Shields and one Champions League title.

“Didier Drogba, that’s my idol. In every sense of the term. For everything. The man, of course, and also the player he was, he told France Football.

“I grew up watching him. Still today, I’m addicted to his videos when I’m resting. In my free time, I go on YouTube, I look at his goals, his whole matches when he played in Marseille, Chelsea, Galatasaray…

“Unfortunately, I have not yet had the chance to meet him. I cannot wait to meet him one day. It would be a moment that would stay in my heart forever. And I would take advantage of it to take advice!”

The Nigerian has been sensational in his first season with Les Douges, having scored seven Ligue 1 goals and grabbing two assists so far.
