Super Eagles and Everton forward, Alex Iwobi, thanked the club’s fan for their support after helping the Toffees secure their first away win of the season against Southampton at the St. Mary’s Stadium on Saturday.

Iwobi was brought on in the 74th minutes to replace another former Arsenal player, Theo Walcott, and instantly made an impact to help the team win 2-1.

The 23-year-old had barely spent a minute on the pitch when hethreaded a defence splitting pass to Djibril Sidibe whose assist to Richarlison helped secured the maximum three points.

Iwobi also had a shot blocked by a Southampton defender in the 78th minute.

The Nigeria international immediately took to the social media to thank the fans for their supports.

“Plus three points. Big love for the support,” he wrote.

Since his move Arsenal last summer, Iwobi has only scored two goals for Everton from 12 matches.
