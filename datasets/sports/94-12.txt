VIDEO: 18 months after debut, Isreal Adesanya becomes UFC middleweight champion
Nigerian-born fighter, Israel Adesanya has emerged the undisputed UFC middleweight champion, after beating the former champion Robert Whittaker on Saturday night in Melbourne, Australia.

Adesanya made his debut on the UFC scene 18 months ago.

In front of a big crowd at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia, Adesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC), who entered the bout as interim champion, knocked out Whittaker (20-5 MMA, 11-3 UFC) at the 3:33 mark of the second round to unify the title, reports USA Today.

“He threw everything we expected. We had everything planned from Plan A to Z,” Adesanya said. “It’s unreal. They said I have no knockout power.”

Whittaker, who hadn’t fought since June 2018, came out loading up his shots, catching Adesanya several times over the course of the first round with jabs, hooks and overhands.

However, as the round progressed, Adesanya got his bearing and struck back.

It was reported that Adesanya saved his best for last as he dropped Whittaker to the mat with a count-right that landed flush on the jaw a split second before the horn sounded to end Round 1.
