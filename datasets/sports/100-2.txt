The Explorers of Enugu State University of Science and Technology have been disqualified from the ongoing Higher Institutions Football League for fielding an ineligible player.

This was contained in a statement by the league’s media officer, Olufemi Olatunji, on Thursday.

Olatunji said the higher institution fielded the ineligible player in their first leg match of the semi-final pairing against the Royals of the University of Benin on September 25.

He said, “After an independent investigation into the first leg match of the semi-final pairing between UNIBEN Royals and the ESUT Explorers on September 25 at the UNIBEN Sports Complex in Benin, we are forced to take action.

“The ESUT Explorers have been disqualified from the competition with immediate effect, and they will participate no further in the ongoing HiFL 2019 season for fielding an ineligible player.”

While stating that HiFL remained committed to sustaining a fair and transparent league devoid of any form of malpractice, Olatunji said Malabites of the University of Calabar would replace the Explorers.

He said, “The UNICAL Malabites, being the most recent team to face the Explorers, and in the quarter-finals of the competition, have been cleared to face UNIBEN Royals in the Super Four.

“The match will be a decider at a neutral place, where the winners will vie for the 2019 Champions trophy in the final match, with the losers competing in the third-place match.”
