Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr has been handed a major boost ahead of next month’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Benin Republic and Lesotho with the return of his captain, Ahmed Musa, to training Sports Extra reports.

Musa suffered a knee injury while in action for Al Nassr in their 1-0 win over Al Fateh in a Saudi Arabian League two months ago.

The former VVV Venlo winger was seen running according to a one minute video posted by his club, Al Nassr via their Twitter handle on Tuesday.

The 27-year-old missed the Eagles last two international friendlies against Ukraine and Brazil.

The former CSKA Moscow forward missed Al Nassr’s games against Al Shabab, Al Saad, Al-Hazm and Al-Ahli Al Nassr have been without a win since Musa sustained the knee injury.

He is yet to score this season despite featuring in two games for Al-Nassr. Musa has been capped 87 times by Nigeria scoring 15 goals.
