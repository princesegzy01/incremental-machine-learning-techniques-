Over 10,000 athletes for JAC Motors road race
With just a matter of hours to the maiden edition of the JAC Motors Abeokuta 10km Road Race, the historic city of Abeokuta is already feeling the pulse of what Saturday November 2, 2019 would be like, when over

Over 10,000 runners will on Saturday storm Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, for the JAC Motors Abeokuta 10km Road Race, organisers have said.

Nilayo Sports Management Company, organisers of the race, earlier in the week began the activities for the first-ever road race in Abeokuta with the Expo, designed to take off the business aspect of the event, especially as it was set aside for sponsors to showcase their products for the world to see.

The Expo started on Monday at the MKO Abiola International Stadium, Abeokuta, to enable the sponsors enough time to market their products to the public.

The Managing Director, Nilayo Sports Management Company, Bukola Olopade, said Thursday afternoon in Abeokuta that the Technical Committee, headed by Olympian and former African record holder in the long jump, Yusuf Ali, have received over 40 entries from world-class long distance runners from Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia, Ghana and other parts of Africa.

He said, “All the invited foreign athletes have been received into Nigeria through the visa on entry scheme.”
