Super Eagles attacker, Samuel Chukwueze, has described his national teammate, Victor Osimhen, as a “complete striker.”

He said this ahead of Wednesday’s (today) Champions’ League Group H clash between Osimhen’s club Lille and Valencia.

“He is a great player, he has a lot of speed and (eye for) goal, he reads (the opposition) very well. He is a very complete forward,” Chukwueze told Superdeporte.es.

Osimhen has proved a constant threat from set pieces and through balls, while he is also one of the leading shot takers in France this season.

He scored his maiden UEFA Champions League goal in Lille’s 2-1 home defeat to Chelsea in match-day two.

Lille welcome Valencia to the Stade Pierre Mauroy on Wednesday night as they search for their first Champions League win of the season.

The French side have lost their opening two games in this year’s competition, conceding five goals in the process, while Valencia sit second ahead of Chelsea on goals difference.
