Wenger keen on Bayern job
Ralf Rangnick has joined Erik ten Hag and Thomas Tuchel in ruling themselves out of the running to take over at Bayern Munich, but Arsene Wenger has declared his interest in the job.

The former Arsenal manager said “of course” when asked about his interest in replacing Niko Kovac at the Bundesliga champions.

Kovac left Bayern following the 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, a result that left Bayern fourth in the Bundesliga table after 10 games.

Wenger, who has been out of work since ending his 22-year reign at Arsenal in 2018, turned 70 in October but is eager to find a way back into management.

Meanwhile, Rangnick followed Ajax boss Ten Hag and PSG coach Tuchel in distancing himself from the vacant position.

“No. Ralf Rangnick is not available,” Marc Kosicke told Bild on Wednesday. “We don’t believe Rangnick has what Bayern are currently looking for. And that’s why it does not make sense to hold concrete talks.”

Former RB Leipzig head coach and sporting director Rangnick took on a new role within the Red Bull system as the Head of Sport and Development in the summer.

Speaking on Tuesday, ahead of PSG’s Champions League game against Club Brugge, Tuchel said, “It doesn’t interest me because I’m PSG coach.

“I have a contract and I can’t think for one minute about other clubs.”

While on Monday, Ten Hag responded to a question about staying with Ajax for remainder of the season by saying: “Yes, I can confirm that.

“I feel a strong connection with my team and everyone at Ajax. I can confirm that I stay at Ajax this season.”
