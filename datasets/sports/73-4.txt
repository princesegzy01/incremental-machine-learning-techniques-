Barca target Chukwueze

Barcelona are pondering a move for Samuel Chukwueze but will not pay his €63m release clause, Gol Digital reports.

The Catalan giants see the 20-year-old as an ideal and a cheaper alternative to PSG forward Neymar should a move for the Brazilian fall through next summer.

Chukwueze has been outstanding for Villarreal since breaking into the first team of the Yellow Submarine, scoring 10 goals in 45 appearances and has provided five assists.

“The big obstacle to hiring Chukuwueze is the price of the deal which can go as high as €63m,” the report on Gol Digital revealed.

“The situation of Ousmane Dembele remains unimproved compared to last season. The injuries return and Barcelona are running out of patience.”

Apart from the Barcelona, top Premier League clubs including Leicester City and Liverpool are reportedly keen on making a move for the Nigeria international.
