First Bank restates commitment to Georgia Cup sponsorship
First Bank Nigeria Limited has restated its commitment to the sponsorship of polo’s most coveted trophy, the Georgian Cup.

Speaking at the 100th edition of the cup in Kaduna at the weekend, the Chief Executive Officer of First Bank, Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, said the shared value of passion, heritage and excellence helped the bank sustained the sponsorship.

“We are happy to be a longtime partner of Kaduna Polo Club. It is a rare opportunity and we want to thank the Club for it. We will continue to support the club and Georgian Cup for the next 100-years,” Adeduntan said.

Meanwhile, finalists at this year’s Georgian Cup lived up to expectations as both teams put polo fans including government functionaries and traditional rulers on their toes throughout the Six Chukker round.

Abuja Rubicon, led by Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika, came from a three-goal deficit to beat and Lintex Agad, led by Bashir Dantata, 7-6 at full time.

The win is the third for Rubicon, since joining the High Goal cadre. They won the event in 2012 and 2016.

Part of the highlights of the week-long competition was the introduction of Blue Jacket to previous Georgian Cup winners, with a pledge by the President of the Kaduna Polo Club, Suleiman Abubakar, to ensure that winners of the Georgian Cup would be robed in blue Jackets.

Present at the Centenary Georgian Cup were the Emir of Katsina, Alhaji Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari and the Deputy Governor of Adamawa State, Martins Babale.

This year’s Georgian Cup coincided with the 125th anniversary celebration of First Bank.
