Fans slam Tite, Selecao over Eagles draw
Kelvin Ekerete

Football fans in Brazil have slammed the national team and coach Tite for failing to beat Nigeria in their last international friendly at the Singapore National Stadium on Sunday.

The game, which ended 1-1, meant the Selecao have failed to record a win in their last four outings, with their last win coming in the Copa America final against Peru in July.

Fans have been left furious by the team’s inability to replicate the form that saw them win their ninth Copa title.

Supporters said the team have reached an all-time low and should be ashamed of wearing the traditional “Yellow and Blue.”

@robmed wrote, “You should be ashamed to stain this shirt with shame and unwillingness!”

Fora Diego Ribas said, “Bad result against Nigeria and this result can be tied to the CBF, Tite’s cluelessness. Shame on them.”

However, Nady Nogueira, says the coach alone should not be blamed for the team’s misfortunes.

“Rather than criticising just the coach, as most are doing, would you like to know when there will be players in love with the shirt again? When there will be real patriotic players? Because in my view the problem is not just in Tite.”

Erick wrote, “Here is my thought, Tite will sink the team if he continues with Coutinho, Jesus, Neymar, Firmino he needs to change the disc.”
