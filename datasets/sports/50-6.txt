Board members of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria met on Thursday as probe into the factors responsible for Team Nigeria’s poor outing at the World Athletics Championship held in Doha, Qatar enters day four.

It was learnt that at least three officials of the AFN, including the president, Shehu Gusau, were invited by the ministerial review committee in the ongoing probe.

Though the agenda of the meeting was not made public, our correspondent gathered that issues discussed may not be unconnected with the ongoing probe.

When contacted on the telephone, the Technical Director of the AFN, Sunday Adeleye, debunked reports that the meeting was called to address challenges faced in Doha.

He explained that the meeting was summoned to plan for other competitions that the country would be participating in.

“The meeting is long overdue. As a board, we want to talk about the 2020 Olympics. Doha has come and gone, we are looking at the future,” he said.

The committee, which was handed seven terms of references including evaluation of factors responsible for the poor performance of Team Nigeria at the 2019 World Athletics Championship, is expected to submit its report next week.
