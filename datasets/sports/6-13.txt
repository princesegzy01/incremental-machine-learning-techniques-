House of commotion! Gunners stars query Auba’s captaincy
A number of Arsenal players have reportedly questioned the decision to hand the club captaincy to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Earlier this month, Granit Xhaka was stripped of the skipper’s armband as a result of his angry outburst towards supporters who cheered his substitution against Crystal Palace.

While it has been suggested that the Gabon international is a welcome replacement, The Athletic claims that the appointment of the forward has been queried by some of his teammates.

The report says that there are concerns over Aubameyang’s links to AFTV, an unofficial Youtube channel which focuses on the Gunners.

Aubameyang has liked a number of posts on the account, which some players and staff feel has contributed to the negativity at the Emirates Stadium.

As a result of having just over 18 months left on his contract, Aubameyang is also being linked with a future exit from the Premier League outfit.
