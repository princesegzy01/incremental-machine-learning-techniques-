Solomon-Otabor still hungry for Eagles chance
Johnny Edward

Victor Solomon-Otabor is determined to force his way back into Gernot Rohr’s squad despite being overlooked for next month’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho, Sports Extra reports.

The winger earned his invitation to the Super Eagles squad for the first time in an international friendly against Brazil but was overlooked for the AFCON qualifiers.

“It was a dream come true to be included in the Eagles the last time out, so hopefully one day I’ll be back in there.

“I want to keep performing as well as I can and then see where we go from there.

“I just have to keep focusing on making sure I’m the best I can be every week for CKSA Sofia. I’d like to think I’m doing that at the moment, so I’ll continue that throughout this season and see what happens.”

Solomon-Otabor has made one assist in eight games so far this season for CSKA Sofia.
