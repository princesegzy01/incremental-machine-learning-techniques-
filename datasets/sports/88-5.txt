Tomori: I broke Costa’s nose
Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori has recalled breaking the nose of former teammate Diego Costa.

The Chelsea defender, 21, was still a schoolboy when he came off best in a training-ground collision with the now Atletico Madrid striker.

Tomori said, “I was still in school and I didn’t actually know I’d done it.

“It was an accident. We both went up — he headed the back of my head and broke his nose.

“I didn’t know until the next day when it was all over the papers. I was getting a lot of messages as if I had meant to do it.

“I got a bit of stick. It was light-hearted, a lot of banter.

“I got back to school and people were asking me.

“But he was all right about it. He didn’t kick me in training after that!”
