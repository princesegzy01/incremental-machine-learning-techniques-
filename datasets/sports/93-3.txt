CCL: Hold me responsible for Enyimba’s elimination, says Abd’Allah

Enyimba coach, Usman Abd’Allah, has taken responsibility for the team’s elimination from this year’s CAF Champions League.

The Aba-based side failed to make it to the group stage of the competition, after losing 1-0 to Al Hilal in Sudan last Sunday.

Both sides had earlier played a goalless draw at the Aba International Stadium.

“That’s football normally, we tried, we couldn’t qualify. I think we lost the match in Aba, we should have taken our chances over there,” he told The PUNCH.

“Naturally when you lose, there are a lot of things that went wrong. When you win, then you have gotten everything right. We are talking about what went wrong because we lost. The most important thing is the game is lost and we cannot bring it back.

“But as I always say that there are lessons to learn when things like that happen so that you become more experienced and wok on the weaknesses that came. We are still in the continent (Confederations Cup), the most important thing is to look behind and see where we went wrong so that we can rectify that in the next continental game,” he said.

“There are a lot of things which I will have to sit and consider where I went wrong and then learn and work. The challenges should be on me, the players did very well. Everything that happened, I should be held responsible for it. I think I haven’t done enough. So, we will go back and look at it and understand what we did wrong.”
