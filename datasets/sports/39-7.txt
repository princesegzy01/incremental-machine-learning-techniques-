City slap £100m on Jesus
Manchester City will demand £100m for striker Gabriel Jesus with Bayern Munich interested in signing the Brazilian, according to a report.

The 22-year-old has been a key figure for City since joining from Palmeiras, scoring his 50th goal for the club in last weekend’s 2-0 win over Crystal Palace.

Bayern’s interest in winger Leroy Sane during the summer was clear to see but according to The Sun, the German champions are also keen on Jesus.

The newspaper says that Bayern are monitoring the striker’s situation, the player having started only four Premier League games so far this season and unable to hold down a regular role in the lineup.

However, the newspaper says that boss Pep Guardiola eyes Jesus as the long-term successor to 31-year-old Sergio Aguero and has let the City board know of his faith in the Brazilian.

Should Bayern come in for Jesus, it is said that City would want four times the £28.6m they paid for him in 2016.
