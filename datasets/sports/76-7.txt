Club Brugge attacker, David Okereke, is unfazed by his recent Eagles snub, insisting that a superb display for the Blue Black in the ongoing league campaign will definitely grab the attention of the national team handlers and earn him future national team call-ups.

The former Spezia player didn’t feature in the international friendlies against Ukraine and Brazil despite posting impressive performances for the capital-based outfit.

However, the 22-year-old believes it is only a matter of time before he gets a national team call-up, assuring that a wonderful campaign with Brugge will definitely help his course.

“I am not disturbed by that, right now am concentrating on my club.

“I’m settling down and doing well with Brugge. The national team call-up will definitely come as long as I’m working hard and making my statement on the pitch.

“But, now let me do well with Brugge and hopefully, the national team handlers will reach out to me,” he told Sports Extra.

Okereke has scored four goals and grabbed an assist in 10 league appearances so far this season.
