Abuja 2020: Wulff-Caesar backs Nigerian lifters to shine
The Marketing Director of FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria Plc, Chris Wulff-Caesar, has restated the company’s commitment to Nigeria’s para-powerlifters ahead of February’s Para-Powerlifting World Cup in Abuja.

He stated that Peak Milk, the Official Milk of Abuja 2020, as the three-day competition is called, believed in the indomitable spirit of the athletes, who rose above their physical challenges to do the nation proud in global tournaments.

Wulff-Caesar said, “Peak conceived and campaigned the ‘Unstoppable’ concept, which was driven by the realisation that as challenging as their current situation might be, the para powerlifting athletes remain optimistic about their dreams and aspirations.

“We called them the ‘Unstoppable’ because they dared the odds and confronted their disability to excel where only the strong can survive. We are glad that they justified our expectations and they are now well known globally as ‘the Unstoppable.’”

He assured the Chief Host of Abuja 2020, Mrs Aisha Buhari, wife of the President, that they would throw their weight behind the successful hosting of the Games, and also support the Nigerian continent to the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics.

He encouraged the athletes, coaches and administrators to make the best possible use of the opportunity of representing the country at global tournaments.
