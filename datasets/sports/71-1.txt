GOtv Boxing Night Mini thrills boxers
The introduction of GOtv Boxing Night Mini, which debuts on November 16 at the Rowe Park Sports Complex, Lagos, has sparked excitement among boxers. The decision to introduce GOtv Boxing Night Mini was announced on Monday by the organisers, Flykite Productions.

According to the organisers, GOtv Boxing Night Mini, which will hold more frequently at various venues, will give boxers more opportunities to fight and build their fight profiles to increase their eligibility for international titles.

Kamaru “Slow Poison” Aremu, a boxer yet to make his professional bow, said, “I like GOtv Boxing Night and I have tried to be on the bill a few times, but I have not succeeded. With GOtv Boxing Night Mini, which will hold more regularly than the big ones, I believe that boxers in my shoes will have opportunities to fight and also feature at the main event.”

Sikiru “Omo Iya Eleja” Shogbesan, who had one fight at GOtv Boxing Night, shares same sentiment with Aremu.

“GOtv are about the only serious sponsors of boxing in Nigeria. It means getting to fight at the main event is tough. But with the mini edition, boxers stand to have more opportunities, as GOtv Boxing Night Mini will hold more frequently,” he said.

Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, West African Boxing Union lightweight champion, who is billed to fight at the maiden edition, said the tournament will provide him an opportunity to keep in shape for the African Boxing Union lightweight title bout against incumbent champion, Oto “Joe Boy” Joseph, in December.

Both boxers were billed to clash for the title at GOtv Boxing Night 20. The bout had to be postponed, following a shoulder injury suffered by Joe Boy.
