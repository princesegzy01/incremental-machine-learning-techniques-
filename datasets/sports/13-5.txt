We’ll do everything to retain title – Imama

Nigeria’s U-23 team coach, Imama Amapakabo, has assured Nigerians that the team will put in their best to retain the U-23 Africa Cup of Nations.

Cup holders Nigeria will confront the Ivory Coast in Cairo in Saturday’s opener in Group B of the event.

A statement from the Nigeria Football Federation quoted Imama as saying this when top officials of the Nigeria embassy in Cairo, led by Abubakar Muhammad, visited the team to deliver the message of the ambassador, Prof. Dandatti Abdulkadir.

Despite the absence of the substantive captain Azubuike Okechukwu and forward Taiwo Awoniyi for Saturday’s encounter, Amakapabo is bullish about the chances of his team against the fellow West Africans.

He said, “We have players in camp here who are ready to give their all and do Nigeria proud any day, any time. We are quietly confident, and will take it one match at a time.

“We are quite aware that as defending champions, so much is expected of us. This team will throw everything into the battle and ensure it does not disappoint Nigerians.”
