No Nigerian player present and past made the Premier League’s top 50 best players in the last decade.

The Premier League remains one of the most competitive leagues in the world, and a football destination for the finest players on the planet to showcase their talents.

It is league that has welcomed Nigeria’s finest in the last decade and present times.

But, unfortunately no Nigerian stars were considered good enough to make to make the Premier League’s elite 50, according to the Daily Mirror.

Ex-Chelsea duo Mikel Obi and Victor Moses had won titles at Stamford Bridge outfit before taking a bow, but they couldn’t make it into the Top 50.

Former Watford hitman, Odion Ighalo, and current Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, who has been a mainstay in the Foxes’ first team ever since completing a £17m deal from Genk in 2016 didn’t make the cut either.

According to Daily Mirror, longevity in the top division and success were factors considered in selecting the Top 50.

Liverpool duo, Sadio Mane and Mohammed Salah, Manchester City’s Algerian attacker, Riyad Mahrez, and former Citizens, Yaya Toure and Blues legend, Didier, Drogba are the only African players on the list.
