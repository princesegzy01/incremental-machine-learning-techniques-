Former Belgian footballer, Wesley Sonck, has said Super Eagles forward Paul Onuachu reminds me former Czech striker Jan Koller.

Koller, 49, played in the Belgian first division between 1996 and 2001 for Lokeren and Anderlecht.

He won the Belgian Golden Shoe for the best player in the league in 2000 and also emerged highest goals scorer in the 1998/99 season.

“I think he (Onuachu) is an extra weapon. He sometimes reminds me of Jan Koller,” Sonck told Sporza.

“Onuachu is a constant threat in the box and also draws his plan footballing. He is 2.02 meters and has no week foot. With him you can give a ball faster from the flank and he is always in the right place.”

Sonck hopes that Onuachu will continue to get a regular place at Genk.

“Maybe it’s an option to play with two strikers, because there are a few guys at Genk that I find absolutely substandard. (Theo) Bongonda is unrecognisable and I also wonder what extra (Ianis) Hagi brings.”

Onuachu has been on fine form since joining Genk from Danish club Midtjylland.

He has scored four goals in five appearances for the club.
