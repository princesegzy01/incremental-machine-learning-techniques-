T20 World Cup qualifiers: Nigeria lose to UAE
The Yellow Greens of Nigeria on Thursday lost for the fourth consecutive time at the Menâ€™s ICC T20 World Cup Qualifiers to hosts UAE who won by five wickets.

UAE won the toss against Nigeria and opted for their African rivals to bat first at the Tolerance Oval in Abu Dhabi.

Nigeria recovered from her 71 runs loss against Oman on Wednesday to record 111 for the loss of three wickets in the first innings.

A superb unbeaten 50-run partnership for the Nigerian pair of Sesan Adedeji and Chimezie Onwuzulike was however not enough to stop their Asian rivals.

UAE, who now sit with three wins in five games, came in to chase and scored 112 in 12.3 overs with the loss of five wickets.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the Yellow Greens now stay in bottom place in the group among six other rivals.

The win for UAE put them level on points at the top of the table with Canada and Oman, but both of them have played fewer games than the home side.

Nigeria will take on Ireland on Saturday.
