Ighalo: Osimhen will deliver for Eagles
Johnny Edward

Odion Ighalo believes Lille star Victor Osimhen and other strikers will deliver for the Eagles but was quick to call for patience as they settle into the No.9 role, Sports Extra reports.

The Shanghai Shenhua striker, who called time on his international career after finishing as the top scorer at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, said Osimhen had all the qualities to flourish if given the needed support on and off the pitch.

“Watch out for Osimhen, he will come good for the Eagles,” Ighalo who grabbed his side’s match-winner on Sunday told Sports Extra.

“They (Eagles strikers) just need time to settle in well.”

Since Ighalo’s exit, the Eagles have scored three goals, with Glasgow Rangers’ Joe Aribo scoring twice and Osimhen getting off the mark for the three-time AFCON winners from the penalty spot in a 2-2 draw against Ukraine.

Nigeria host Benin Republic in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier next month and Osimhen is expected to make his third start for the Eagles.
