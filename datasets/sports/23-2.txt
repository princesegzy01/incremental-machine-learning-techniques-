Aguirre takes over from Pellegrino at Leganes
Mexican coach Javier Aguirre will take charge of Leganes for the remainder of the season following the sacking last month of the Argentine Mauricio Pellegrino, the La Liga club announced Monday.

“Leganes and Mexican coach Javier Aguirre Onaindia reached an agreement for the Aztec coach to take charge of the Pepineros’ bench until the end of the season,” a statement in English said on the club website.

The 60-year-old’s mission will be to save Leganes from relegation. The Pepineros have won once in 12 games this season and sit bottom of the table with just five points to their name.

It is a task he is well used to, having successfully rescued Osasuna and Espanyol in earlier stints in Spain.

Aguirre has also taken charge of Real Zaragoza and Atletico Madrid, giving him over 350 games as a coach in La Liga.

Aguirre played 59 times for Mexico and featured at the 1986 World Cup. He later coached Mexico in two separate spells at the 2002 and 2010 World Cups.

He was in charge of Egypt for this year’s Africa Cup of Nations but was sacked after the hosts were knocked out by South Africa.
