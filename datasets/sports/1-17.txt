Benin captain Stephane Sessegnon has rued his side’s 2-1 loss to the Super Eagles in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Uyo on Wednesday.

France-based duo Victor Osimhen and Samuel Kalu won the game for Nigeria, scoring in either half after Sessegnon had put Benin ahead from a Jodel Dossou’s cross in the third minute.

In his reaction after the match, the Genclerbirligi forward conceded to the superiority of the Eagles.

“We played against a good team. The Nigerian team are very good and you know it is a difficult game. For us it is a bad result, but it is a good game (to prepare us) for the next game,” he told reporters after the game.

Benin will lock horns with Sierra Leone in their second AFCON game on Sunday.
