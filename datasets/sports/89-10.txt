Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen, has broken a 20-year-old record in the French Ligue 1, after scoring in Lille’s 2-2 draw against Nimes on Sunday.

According to Opta Jean, Osimhen’s goal on Sunday ensured he has scored in five consecutive home games.

That was the first time a player achieved the feat since 1999.

“Victor Osimhen has become the first player to score in each of his first five home games in Ligue 1 since Alex (Dias) with St Etienne in 1999. Impressive,” Opta Jean tweeted.

Brazilian Alex, 47, played for St Etienne between 1999 and 2001, scoring 28 goals in 54 appearances for the club.

He moved to PSG in 2001, spending a year, before returning to St Etienne, where he played another one season.

Osimhen has been in great scoring form since moving to Lille from Belgian club Sporting Charleroi for €12m.

He opened his account with a brace in their first home league match against Nantes, which they won 2-1.

He scored another brace in Lille’s 3-0 win over St Etienne.

The home games against Angers and Strasbourg, which saw Lille winning 2-1 and 2-0 respectively also saw Osimhen scoring one goal each.

Osimhen’s goalscoring form in Lille’s home turf has seen him been dubbed the “Prince of Stade Pierre-Mauroy” by the club.

Stade Pierre-Mauroy is Lille’s home ground.

Meanwhile, Osimhen has been shortlisted for the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of The Month for September.

Monaco’s Islam Slimani and Nicolas Pallios of Nantes are the other players nominated for the award.
