Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has allayed fears that he could return to the bench with Alexandre Lacazette set to return for the Gunners, insisting that Unai Emery trust him to deliver whenever he is called upon.

According to football.london, the English-born footballer of Nigerian descent will be happy having all players available as it brings about the best in everyone.

“It’s always good to have all our best players available, all of us competing make us push to play better and better,” he said.

“If one player is injured then others get an opportunity but I want everyone to come back and do the best for Arsenal.

“The boss knows what I can do, what the other players can do. Different games require different players but I feel like I’ve shown the boss he can trust me. Whatever game he puts me in I’ll always give it my all.”

“The boss has really trusted me and put a lot of faith in me. I just try to work hard in training every day, he has given me the opportunity to work in this team. I’ve learned so much from the other players and it’s showing on the pitch.

“Do I feel established in the first team? I don’t know yet, I just try to work hard, give my all and put in a good performance.

“Hopefully after I’ve put in that performance I can build on it. If the boss trusts me to play I’ll always do my best.”

Saka has contributed a goal and three assists from five games at the senior level.
