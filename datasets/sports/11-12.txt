Bach’s visit will boost Nigerian sports –Dare
The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare says the visit of the President of the International Olympic Committee, Dr Thomas Bach, to Nigeria will boost sports development in the country.

The minister said this on Friday in Abuja at a pre-event media briefing ahead of the two-day working visit of the IOC president scheduled for November 13 and 14 in Abuja.

“The visit by the IOC president and his team is quite significant as it shows the place of Nigeria in the heart of the International Olympic Movement.

“It is also a clear sign that Nigeria is highly respected in the sports sector among the committee of African nations,” he said.

He explained that the IOC president as part of his engagements will inaugurate the secretariat of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa among other things.

“The visit of the IOC President is also billed to orchestrate other activities which include a courtesy call to State House, tour of the facilities at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja and meetings with Olympians, Olympic scholarship holders, NOC partners and visits to NOC partner schools.”
