Kaizer Chiefs coach, Ernst Middendorp, has praised Nigerian goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi, for his impressive displays at the club since joining from Chippa United in January.

Akpeyi was brought in to fill in for the injured Itumeleng Khune, who picked up a shoulder injury in December 2018.

Khune suffered a relapse in September, with his expected return date yet unknown.

“He’s very grown-up, he always performed and I think sometimes you have people who say the wall is grey and some other people for some odd reason they say, ‘no, the wall is green,’” Middendorp told Kickoff.

“I understand, he just came in to help the club with Khune injured, he had to improve and be better, and I think there’s a certain institution who worked on these issues.

“Despite criticism, he’s been performing and he’s a very special player,” he concluded.

Khune also took to his Instagram page to acknowledge Akpeyi as the club’s “best in the business” in terms of stopping spot-kicks.

Akpeyi has been in form this season helping Kaizer Chiefs to the top of the South African Premier League Soccer league table and also saving two penalties in their quarter-final of the Telkom Knockout game against rivals Orlando Pirates on Saturday to book a spot in the semi-final.
