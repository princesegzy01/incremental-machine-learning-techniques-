Super Eagles on Wednesday beat the Squirrels of Benin Republic 2-1 in their opening Group L match of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo.

Striker Stéphane Sessègnon opened the scoring after five minutes, before Lille’s Victor Osimhen levelled from the spot on the stroke of half-time.

After the break, Bordeaux forward Samuel Kalu put Nigeria ahead on 63 minutes, ultimately sealing all three points in Group L.

The Eagles will continue their 2021 AFCON qualifying campaign on Sunday with an encounter with Lesotho at Setsoto Stadium in Maseru.

Nigeria top the group following a 1-1 draw between Sierra Leone and Lesotho in Freetown.

Iceland-based Kwame Quee scored for Sierra Leone in an empty stadium in the 69th minute to give the hosts the lead.

Then in the 83rd minute Lesotho captain Marepe Basia was dismissed for a second yellow card and then George Kweku Davies was shown a straight red for his retaliation.

The visitors then grabbed a point in the third minute of injury time through Thabantso Jane.

In other matches, Guinea Bissau rattled Eswatini 3-0 in Group I, Central African Republic thrashed Burundi 2-0 in E, while Malawi ran away with a lone goal victory over South Africa in Group B.

Elsewhere, Cameroon ended their encounter in Group F with Cape Verde 0-0, while Namibia overpowered Chad 2-1 in Group A.
