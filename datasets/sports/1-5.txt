Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa says the Nigeria national team players expect a tougher game against Lesotho in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match on Sunday.

The Al Nassr player specifically expressed fear over synthetic pitch that will host the match.

The former Leicester City striker, a late substitute in yesterday’s win vs Benin, is targeting another three points in Sunday’s clash against the Crocodiles.

Asked what he expects from the Eagles against Lesotho, Musa said, ‘’As you can see, it was a tough game for the team today but at the end of ninety minutes we have three points so we are going over there to have another win because we know that the game is going to be very tough.

‘’We are going to play on an artificial pitch, it is not that easy because some of the players are not used to playing on synthetic pitch.

‘’But we know what everybody expects from us so we are going there to do our best to win.’’

Meanwhile, some of the Eagles have taken to social media to celebrate their 2-1 victory against Benin on Wednesday.

Among them are William Troost-Ekong, Victor Osimhen, Wilfred Ndidi and Shehu Abdulahi.

Abdullahi said, “Great win on Wednesday, massive team spirit. Big thanks to Uyo fans, even when we were down, they kept supporting the team. Unto the next game against Lesotho.”

“Let’s keep the flag flying,” Ndidi added.

Troost-Ekong tweeted, “Good to start our AFCON 2021 campaign with a win. Always special to play on home soil in Uyo.”
