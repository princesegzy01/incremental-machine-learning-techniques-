Super Eagles forward, Moses Simon, scored the only goal of the match as Nantes left it late to beat Nice in the French League 1 on Saturday.

Moses scored the only goal of the game in the 86th minute of the encounter, his second of the season in the colours of the Nantes and was taken off for Samuel Moutoussamy in the 90th minute.

Head coach of the team, Christian Gourcuff, referred to Simon’s goal as a beauty, adding that it crowned the team’s overall effort.

“We created the opportunities, the goal is beautiful,” he said.

Simon will be hoping to replicate his form when he joins up with the Eagles ahead of their international friendly against Brazil in Singapore on October 13.

In Bulgaria, big defender, Stephen Eze, scored a brace in Locomotiv Plovdiv’s 5-0 win at Etar.

Eze, who has now scored three goals in eight appearances for the club this season, tweeted after the game, “Celebrating the 5-0 win against Etar, God’s mercies for the two goals to finish off the match beautifully, I guess this defender does have his moments. Tremendous support of our fans made all the difference.”
