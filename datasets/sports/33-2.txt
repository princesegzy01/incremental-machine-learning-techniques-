Golden Eaglets coach Manu Garba says the team’s technical crew are working hard to address the defensive problems of his team at the ongoing U-17 World Cup in Brazil.

The Nigerian team have conceded four games in two matches – two each against Hungary and Ecuador, and battle Australia at the Estadio Bezerrao, Gama on Friday (today).

With their 4-2 and 3-2 wins against Hungary and Ecuador respectively, the Eaglets have qualified for the Round of 16. But Australia need a victory in the match for a possible qualification. They have a point after playing a 2-2 draw with Hungary and losing 2-1 to Ecuador in their opening game.

Garba said, “We are meeting Australia on Friday (today) and we are going to approach the match with a winning mentality, so as to conveniently top the group. We will maintain the tempo against Australia, who are also a good team.

“As a coach, I don’t want to throw everything open here but we promise we will work more on our defensive lapses, which I think it’s more of lack of concentration amongst the boys. Be assured that the team will continue to improve as the tournament progresses.”

The coach commended his players’ display in their 3-2 win against Ecuador in their second group game.

“I salute the doggedness of my boys for their never say die attitude and mental strength.” What a lot of people don’t know is that Ecuador are a very technical side who were also physically strong, so I want to praise my boys for pushing till the end. I am very proud of them,” he added.
