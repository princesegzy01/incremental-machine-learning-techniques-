Ebenezer Bajela

Super Eagles and Nante forward, Simon Moses, has said he does not intend to break his record 15 back flips in his next celebration when he scores, as he demands consistency in his performance and that of his teammates.

The 24-year-old, known for his acrobatic celebration, was asked on Nantes podcast how many back flip he intends doing to celebrate his next goal. But the Nigeria international was firm and direct with his response.

“My record is about 15 back flips, but I do not think I’ll do the same on my next goal,” he said.

Simon, who is on loan from Spanish club, Levante, also gave his assessment on the team as he demands focus from his teammates.

“We still have a lot of work; we work hard with the team.

“I think I have to be more regular in my performances, but first of all we have to focus on the goal of the team, which is the victories.”

The former KAA Gent player has made eight appearances for The Canaries, scoring two goals with an assist.
