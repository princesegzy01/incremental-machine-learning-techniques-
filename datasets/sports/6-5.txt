Fury predicts winner in S’Arabia bout
Tyson Fury has claimed he knew Anthony Joshua would lose to Andy Ruiz Jr during the ring walk after spotting his Brit rival “looking cold”.

On December 7 in Diriyah Saudi Arabia, the deposed champion gets his shot at redemption and the chance to win back the world titles.

And while Fury has backed AJ to beat Ruiz Jr so they can finally have an all-British battle, the Gypsy King revealed his money was on the Mexican during their first bout.

In an interview with The Times, the 31-year-old had expected his compatriot to retain his belts “quite comfortably, but that changed when (he) saw him making his walk to the ring”.

He said, “Both Ben and myself immediately felt that there was something not quite right because Joshua looked cold, and by that I mean that there wasn’t a bit of sweat on his body.
