Osimhen eager to end away goal drought
Johnny Edward

Lille striker Victor Osimhen says he is desperate to end his goal drought away from the Stade Pierre-Mauroy to justify the faith shown in him by manager Christophe Galtier, Sports Extra reports.

Osimhen has failed to score in seven away games this season for Lille despite bagging eight goals in 14 games across all competition this term.

“I know I have eight goals so far this season but none away from home but I’m not bothered about it, “Osimhen told Sport Extra.

“I have to start with one and who knows it could be against Valencia.

“I might set myself a target, but I swear right helping my team win and scoring my first goal away is my only objective.

“I need to get in the box more in away games. I don’t do it enough because we must keep our shape well, but it is something I am working to try to do more.

The 20-year-old will be aiming to score his first goal away for Lille when they take on Valencia at the Mestalla stadium on Tuesday (tonight).
