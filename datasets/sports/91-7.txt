‘Schools sports will help discover talents’
The Chairman of Providence Schools, Lagos, Mr Ademola Obiyemi, has stressed the need for primary and secondary schools to inculcate sporting activities in their curriculum, saying it will help develop future talents for the country.

Obiyemi, during the inter-house sports competition of the school in Lagos recently, said sporting activities would help to develop the cognitive functions of the pupils.

“Sporting activities keep the body fit; it’s from events like inter-house sports that we can develop talents for the future. Athletes that will represent the country can be discovered from school sporting activities. The likes of Blessing Okagbare, Mary Onyali started like this and they went out there to represent the country.

“When we allow these kids to develop their talents, the county will benefit from it, their talents will not be buried,” Obiyemi said.

He also urged government to provide sporting facilities communities, to help pupils develop their talents.

“I want to advise all schools to take sports seriously. The government should also provide sports grounds for schools. Every community must have a sporting field if we are to grow in sport in this country,” Obiyemi added.

Red House came first while Blue and Green houses came second and third respectively in the overall medals table of the inter-house sports competition.
