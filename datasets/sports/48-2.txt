Kelvin Ekerete

After scoring his first UEFA Champions League goal against champions Liverpool, Nigerian striker, Stephen Odey, has dedicated the goal to his mother.

Odey replaced compatriot Paul Onuachu in the 81st minute and was cautioned three minutes later for a foul. The striker then ensured that the champions did not go back to England with a clean sheet scoring his team’s consolation goal two minutes from time.

The mother of the former MFM FC of Lagos goal poacher celebrated her birthday on Tuesday, a day before the striker bagged his first goal for the club.

Odey wrote on Twitter,“ I will like to dedicate my first Champions League goal to my mum who marked her birthday on Tuesday as a birthday gift. Thanks for guiding me in the right path.”
