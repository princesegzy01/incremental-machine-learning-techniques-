Twitter users have advised Nigeria and Villarreal forward, Samuel Chukwueze, to sharpen his scoring ability by improving on his shooting if he is to stand any chance of winning the next Puskas award.

After a video surfaced online where the Nigerian international dribbled past six players but failed to score, fans believed that the 20-year-old is one of the best dribblers in the game but want him to also improve his conversion ratio to place him among the best.

A Twitter user with the name Flex Caribbean said, “Man needs to improve his shooting and conversion ratio. Showboating isn’t the all and all of football.”

Umar Safana also tweeted, “Football funny of the year. This is how some people miss their destiny. Samuel Chukwueze did this.

“Could easily have won the next Puskas award.”

David is of the opinion that the 20-year-old can be a world class if he can improve his scoring ability.

“The only thing lacking in his game is finishing, he’ll be a world class player if he can work on his shooting accuracy and finishing.”

Another twitter user @Kingkols3 said, “This video is one of the things that have pained me the most in my life.

“Because he could have won the puskas.”

“Then he plays with his head always looking down… He needs to look up sometimes,” Akinalabi wrote.
