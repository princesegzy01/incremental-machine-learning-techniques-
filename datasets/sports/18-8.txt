The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority hammered Office of The Surveyor-General 4-1 to emerge champions of the 14th Head of Service Games at the Agege Stadium on Tuesday.

LASTMA took the lead in the second minute through Ismail Ajala, Adio Kabiru pounced on a loose ball to give the transport officers their second goal, while midfielde, Morufu Ashade chipped the goalkeeper to give his team a three-goal cushion just before half time.

Substitute, Ogundele Akinwale, scored the last goal for LASTMA, while Martins Oluwafemi scored the consolatory goal for men of the Office of The Surveyor-General.

In the women’s final, Public Service Office defeated Lagos State Sports Commission 3-0 to emerge winners of the 14th edition.

Defender, Mukairu Opeyemi, grabbed the opener in the third minute from the penalty spot, while midfielder, Rosemary Dennis, scored the team’s second goal six minutes into the second half before Opeyemi grabbed her brace after her free-kick on the edge of the box was deflected in.

Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who witnessed the matches, commended the Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, for putting together the event.

“This has been a very good event, not just football but a combination of other sports. This is a laudable project and I know the next edition of the Games will be better,” Sanwo-Olu said.

Muri-Okunola said, “What we discovered is that a lot of people have varying talents and everyone wants to exhibit what they have in a competitive manner and what we felt was obtainable was to make these sports included to be competitive and rewarding.”
