Why I chose England over Nigeria – Tomori

Chelsea defender, Fikayo Tomori, has revealed he opted to play for England over Nigeria because they were the first to hand him a senior international call-up.

England coach, Gareth Southgate, included Tomori and fellow Chelsea player, Tammy Abraham, in his 25-man squad for their Euro 2020 qualifier against Czech Republic and Bulgaria.

According to the 21-year-old, “England is such a big nation, as well as Nigeria and Canada, so I think I was going to be happy with whoever called me up – but it’s nice it is England,” he told Goal.

“It wasn’t England all the way. I had certain people and certain things that I had to consider. I spoke to my family and people about it and that’s the decision I came to. So, when England came calling, it was difficult to say no.

“It was just more of a thing I was waiting for a call-up because the last international break I didn’t get a call-up from anyone. This international break, I was waiting for a call-up and England called me up.

“I told my family and then it got announced on Thursday. Not at all (did I see it coming). The manager told me and I was like ‘oh’. It was a nice feeling. I’d say so (that it came quicker than I expected).

“It is obviously good I am here and now, to be in the England squad, it’s a mad turnaround for myself.”

Tomori has been in fine form for Chelsea this season, playing eight games. He has one goal and one assist.
