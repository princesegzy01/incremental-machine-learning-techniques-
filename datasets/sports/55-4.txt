Champions League: Kante, Barkley out of Ajax clash
Chelsea are set to be without N’Golo Kante and Ross Barkley for the Champions League trip to Ajax on Wednesday night.

The midfield duo missed the final session on Tuesday before the game, with the players scheduled to fly out to Amsterdam after training.

Barkley limped off during Chelsea’s Premier League win over Newcastle at the weekend and is suffering from an ankle problem. Kante has made just four appearances in the league this season due to injury and hurt himself again while on international duty with France.

The defensive midfielder missed the win over Newcastle and will sit out the away fixture at Ajax, according to the Daily Mail.

There was good news for Chelsea as Emerson Palmieri and Antonio Rudiger took part in training at Cobham.

Frank Lampard has already called for patience with Rudiger’s recovery, but Emerson is nearing a return to action.

Chelsea travel to Ajax third in their Champions League group, level on points with Valencia, with their opponents sitting top.

A win or draw in Amsterdam would be a big boost to Chelsea as Lampard aims to guide his inexperienced squad into the knockout stages.
