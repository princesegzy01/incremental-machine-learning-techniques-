Super Eagles defender, Ola Aina, has backed Sampdoria’s England-born midfielder of Guinea Bissau descent, Ronaldo Vieira, after he was racially abused by Roma fans in the away section of the Stadio Luigi Ferrarris.

The hosts held the Gialorossi to a scoreless draw, but the racism scourge that has tainted Italian football in recent months reared its ugly head again as Lupi fans hurled racist abuses at the 21-year-old England junior international.

Roma were quick to distance themselves from the gesture, while the solidarity for Vieira from players having gained momentum, with Aina being the latest to offer his support to the English player.

He wrote on his Instagram handle, “With you bro,” with a fist emoji.

Racism in football is a major setback for the game in Europe. Black players on either international engagements or club football have continuously been subjected to racist abuses and chants from fans.

Ola Aina has made ten appearances in all competitions so far this season for the Granata.
