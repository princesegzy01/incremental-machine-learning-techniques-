German club, SC Paderborn, announced on their Twitter handle on Wednesday that Nigeria left-back, Jamilu Collins, is back in training after missing last weekend’s defeat against FC Cologne and is available to face Fortuna Düsseldorf in their next league game at the Benteler-Arena on Saturday.

Collins was part of the Super Eagles team that played a 1-1 draw with Brazil on October 13 in Singapore but picked up a flu virus upon his return to Germany and was left out of the matchday 8 last weekend as SC Paderborn were thrashed 3-0 by Cologne.

“Work has been going on inside, now it’s getting on the grass in preparation. @UweHuenemeier2 (Ankle joint) is missing, Marlon Ritter (Move). Jamilu Collins is back after his flu illness,” the club wrote with a video of the players in training.

Collins scored his first goal for the club in the Bundesliga in their 3-2 loss to Bayern Munich on match-day six.

Paderborn are bottom of the table with one point from eight games.
