The Nigeria Cricket Federation president, Professor Yahaya Ukwenya, says the men’s cricket team faces a tough task as they seek to pick a historic ticket for the 2020 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in Australia.

The men’s national cricket team get their bid for the World Cup underway on Saturday (today) when they play Jersey in the final 14-nation qualification tournament in the United Arab Emirates.

With Zimbabwe suspended, the Nigeria cricket team, which had finished in third-place behind Kenya and Namibia in the African qualifiers, were drafted in to take the vacant spot in the final qualifying tournament.

A final preparatory game – their tenth – resulted in a first-ever win over former World Cup semi-finalists Kenya in the UAE.

Ukwenya, though happy with the victory over Kenya, admitted that it was going to be a tough task for the country.

“We beat Kenya for the first time in our history.

“You will understand that Kenya, Uganda and Namibia, even Ghana at a point, were well ahead of us on the continent, including Botswana.

“And even when we were part of the West African selection, where Nigeria had to play against other West African countries, I don’t think we ever beat Kenya. So I think some progress has been made, the boys are in good spirits,” he added.

“It’s going to be a bit difficult competition for us because we are playing way out of our league in terms of the quality of games we have played, our facilities, our development; these qualifiers, is on paper, way out of our league,” he said.
