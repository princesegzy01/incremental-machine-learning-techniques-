Ahly hire Arabic teacher for Ajayi
Johnny Edward

Egyptian giants Al Ahly have hired an Arabic language expert to teach duo Junior Ajayi and Geraldo Bartholomew how to speak Arabic.

The move is to ensure that there is harmony and understanding among the foreign and local players in the team, according to a report on Kingfut.

Ajayi joined Ahly in the summer of 2016, and since then has made over 101 appearances for the club, scoring 31 goals and providing 21 assists.

He also lifted three league titles with Ahly alongside two Egypt Super Cups and the 2017 Egyptian Cup.

Last season, Ajayi was the Reds’ second top scorer in the league with eight goals and seven assists, which helped the club secure a historic league title.

However, he has always been linked with a move away from the club due to his impressive performances, but the one cap Super Eagles striker reassured Ahly’s fans, saying he wants to remain at the club for the season.

He has scored twice in three appearances this season.
