Kelechi Iheanacho’s goal against Burton Albion has been nominated for Leicester City’s Goal of The Month prize for October 2019.

Iheanacho, who has been struggling for playing time since his big money move from Manchester City in 2-017, was given a rare start in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup last week against Burton and he grabbed his chance with both hands, opening the scoring in the seventh minute, following an assist from Youri Tielemans.

A superb counter-attack by Leicester City culminated in Iheanacho finding the back of the net as he nicely sent goalkeeper Kieran O’Hara the wrong way to make it 1-0 for the Foxes.

Jamie Vardy’s goal against Burnley and Ayoze Perez’s three goals against Southampton were among the goals nominated for the award.

Other players shortlisted are Youri Tielemans, Khanya Leshabela, James Maddison, Josh Eppiah.

“The Blue Army have until 11:59pm GMT on Sunday 10 November to vote for their October Goal of the Month,” the website read.
