The Oyo State Commissioner for Youth and Sports Development, Seun Fakorede, has hailed the contributions of late Super Eagles striker Rasheed Yekini to the development of football in Nigeria, saying the state will continue to honour the fallen footballer.

The commissioner said this in a press statement by the Oyo sports ministry to celebrate the posthumous 56th birthday of the football icon on Thursday.

After his exploits in Europe, the prolific striker, who turned 56th on Wednesday, returned to play in the Nigeria Professional Football League.

Yekini became a household name while playing for Shooting Stars, popularly known as Oluyole Warriors.

Fakorede said, “I recall with nostalgic feeling, the life and times of the late former international footballer and the one-time player of the Shooting Stars.

“Yekini’s contribution to the darling club Oluyole Warriors will also not go unnoticed during the early 90s when he contributed meritoriously to the glowing glories of the football club in the Nigerian Premier League.

“We are committed to reposition sports in the state, putting all hands on deck to produce more of the likes of the former legend. The state will therefore continue to celebrate Yekini and his likes, who will do the state proud.”
