Leicester City’s Nigeria midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has hailed his team’s impressive performance following their 2-0 win over Arsenal in the English Premier League at the King Power stadium on Saturday.

Ndidi played the whole 90 minutes and was rock solid in the midfield as he helped neutralized the Gunners attack and could have scored the first goal of the evening but saw his effort cannoned off the cross bar.

Already looking forward to the international break, the 22-year-old tweeted after the game, describing the performance as amazing.

“Amazing performance from the team and three points in the bag to take to the international break,” he wrote on his Twitter handle.

“We keep the momentum Foxes.”

Ndidi will join up with his international teammates ahead of their double header AFCON qualifiers against Benin on Wednesday and Lesotho four days later.
