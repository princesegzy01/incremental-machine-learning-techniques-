Kelvin Ekerete

Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, has charged the Super Eagles to make the country proud when they file out against five-time world champions Brazil at the Singapore National Stadium on Sunday (today).

The minister said he had received assurances coach Gernot Rohr, that they would put in their best against their more illustrious opponents.

“I spoke with some of the Super Eagles players in Singapore. They are ready for the soccer battle on Sunday (today),” he tweeted.

“I also spoke directly with Rohr who assured Nigerians the team will do the country proud. And even though it’s a friendly they will approach the game seriously.”

Nigeria are yet to win a game against Brazil and will be hoping to record a first win while the Selecao are hoping to record a first win in four games.
