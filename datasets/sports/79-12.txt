Casemiro: We’ll use Eagles to redeem image
Kelvin Ekerete

Brazil midfielder, Casemiro, says they will use Sunday’s international friendly against Nigeria to redeem their image in the sight of millions of Brazilian fans worldwide after failing to record a win in their last three games.

Brazil last recorded a win in their 3-1 Copa America win over Peru in July and has since gone on to record two draws and a loss in their last three matches, including a draw against Senegal, a result that has piled more pressure on the players as well as coach Tite.

With the team billed to play Nigeria on Sunday (today), the Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro spoke, about the need for the group to improve and rediscover the good football shown in the conquest of the Copa America.

“It was certainly not a good game. Everyone saw it and we have to be honest about it. The beauty of football is that Sunday (today) we have the opportunity to show that we are good players and a great selection. We have already reviewed the errors and made an analysis. Senegal is already in the past,” he said.

Nigeria have only faced Brazil once at the senior level in a friendly in 2003 in Abuja with the Selecao winning the game 3-0.
