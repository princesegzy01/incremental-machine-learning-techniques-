Klopp: Reds now entering hardest period ever
Liverpool go into their Premier League clash with Tottenham on Sunday with a commanding lead at the top of the Premier League – but boss Jurgen Klopp says his side are about to enter “the hardest period ever” in their pursuit of the title.

The Champions League holders have made a flying start to the 2019/20 campaign, only dropping points in the Premier League for the first time last time out, in their 1-1 draw at Manchester United.

Next up comes the tough test of Mauricio Pochettino’s Tottenham – who are desperate to pull off a big result and shake off the stuttering start they’ve made to their own season.

“We are in a better position than we would have expected at the start of the season,” Klopp said, when asked by Sky Sports’ Phil Thompson whether he is dreaming of landing Liverpool a first Premier League title.

“Are we already through? No. We have created a proper basis to work with. The hardest period ever will come up again. November, December, crazy.

“We have to be lucky in some moments. We have to fight for it, and that’s what we do. No guarantees.”

However, Klopp feels his side have evolved and improved again from last season, where they ran City so close to the crown. The German says Liverpool’s Champions League triumph – while now in the past – has shifted the mindset of his players.

“It was incredible,” Klopp said of the win in Madrid over Spurs. “But it’s a nice memory, wonderful, great, everything perfect, but it’s gone, it’s history.

“It’s a nice part of life, but nothing else changed. It was probably the best summer of my life.

“The boys started the season in a different mindset, more convinced about themselves. I feel there is still a lot of space in that department, where they can be more convinced.”
