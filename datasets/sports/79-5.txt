Brazil vs Nigeria: Selecao clash crucial for Eagles – Rohr
Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr on Saturday in Singapore told the media he is preparing three-time African champions Nigeria for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Benin Republic and Lesotho, with Sunday’s friendly against Brazil.

“The game against Brazil will show how much we are progressing after finishing third at the Africa Cup in Egypt. It is a fantastic opportunity for us to learn a few more things that will make us better and stronger for future challenges,” Rohr stated at the pre-match conference ahead of the clash with the five-time world champions at the Singapore National Stadium in Kallang.

“This is an important test game for us, and we are here to learn from the best. We hope for a very good game against Brazil on Sunday. This will help us prepare ourselves for the 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho next month.

“After the 2019 AFCON, two of our top players (Mikel Obi and Odion Ighalo) retired and we have to see how to replace them. We saw a little bit in our friendly against Ukraine last month and hope we can improve on that performance tomorrow (today).

“A good showing against Brazil will help our confidence a great deal.”
