We are dependent on Osimhen – Galtier
Kelvin Ekerete

Lille coach, Christophe Galtier, has admitted that the club is reliant on Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, after his great start to life in the French Ligue 1.

The Nigeria international has scored seven goals in 10 appearances for the Ligue 1 side including one in the UEFA Champions League against Chelsea on Wednesday.

Speaking ahead of their crucial league game against Nimes on Sunday (today), Galtier insists that it is impossible not to depend on a player that has given good returns since joining the club in the summer from Belgian side, Sporting Charleroi.

“It is impossible not to dependent on Osimhen? All teams are dependent on one or two players. This is how it is done everywhere,” he said during the official press conference.

“In all clubs we say ‘we need an attacker.’ We are lucky at the start of the season, to have a player like Victor score goals, even in situations where much chances isn’t created.”

Despite their dependence on the Nigerian striker, the coach has called on other players to complement his efforts.

“We must work on complementing each other. But we are automatically dependent on his style of play and his performance. It’s up to me to find other players who can be decisive. “
