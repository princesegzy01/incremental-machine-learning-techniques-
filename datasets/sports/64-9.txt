Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme, in his bid to create awareness for blood cancer, has decided to cycle 562 miles in six days.

Ikeme was diagnosed with acute leukaemia in July 2017, forcing the ex-keeper, who was in complete remission after intense chemotherapy, to announce his retirement from football on medical grounds on July 27, 2018.

In order to continue publicity for blood cancer awareness, the ex-international said he would cycle round the eight teams he was on loan to while at Wolverhampton Wanderers.

“I have decided to take on a mega challenge to raise funds and awareness for Race against Blood Cancer – by cycling 562 miles in just six days,” he wrote on his official Instagram handle.

“While I was signed to Wolverhampton Wanderers for my entire career, I also played for eight other clubs on loan, and I intend to visit all of these on my route starting from Middlesborough on May 4, 2019,” he added.

The awareness campaign starts from May 4 to May 9 2019. Ikeme who had his entire career at Wolves also played on loan at Accrington Stanley, Stockport County, Charlton Athletic, Sheffield United, Queens Park Rangers, Leicester City, Middlesbrough, Doncaster Rovers.

Ikeme called on others to join his campaign.

“If you are a keen cyclist who fancies joining me on any – or all of this challenge – please drop us an email.”
