Eriksen denies Vertonghen rift over girlfriend
Christian Eriksen has emphatically denied internet reports that Tottenham team-mate Jan Vertonghen had an affair with his girlfriend, describing them as ‘bulls***’.

Rumours on social media have recently suggested the Belgian defender romanced Eriksen’s girlfriend Sabrina Kvist, which then sparked a huge bust-up in the Spurs dressing room with England captain Harry Kane.

However, the day after Spurs’ embarrassing 7-2 Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich, Eriksen took to Twitter to strongly refute claims of an affair that was dividing the dressing room.

Replying to a tweet that @CasualMind_ posted regarding the online rumours, Eriksen replied with ‘#bulls***’ and a sleeping face emoji.

Vertonghen then replied to Eriksen’s tweet with a series of emojis that seemed to show he agreed with his team-mate. He added a love heart emoji next to Eriksen’s Twitter handle.

Eriksen and Kvist have been together since 2012 and their first child, Alfred, was born in 2018.
