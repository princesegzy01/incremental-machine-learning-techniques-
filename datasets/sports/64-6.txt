Super Eagles B coach, Imama Amapakabo, has rued missed scoring opportunities for the team’s elimination from the 2020 African Nations Championship in Cameroon.

Nigeria needed to score three unreplied goals to book a spot for the competition butamaged a 2-0 over Togo, who qualified 4-3 on aggregate.

Lobi Stars forward Sikiru Alimi scored a brace, but it was not enough to see the Nigerians, finalists at the last edition of the continental event, to scale through.

“There is nothing wrong with the team. We were just unable to score because we were a bit in a hurry in front of goal and we were unable to score some of the chances we created.”

Imama also ruled out the notion that the team does not possess good strikers. I”

In my team I have the top scorers from last season’s league,” he said.

Amapakabo added, “The players played according to instruction and what we had practiced in the last week and I’m glad we were able to keep the Togolese where we wanted them, unfortunately we had the chances but were unable to convert them to give us qualification.”

This is the first edition of CHAN the Eagles will be missing from since making their debut at the competition in 2014, where they finished third in South Africa.
