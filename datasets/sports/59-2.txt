Emery explains Ozil snub
Unai Emery has praised Mesut Ozil ahead of Arsenal’s clash with Sheffield United, and claims his whole squad, without exception, have impressed him in recent weeks.

Though Ozil is Arsenal’s top earner on wages of £350,000-a-week, he has been left out of Emery’s three most recent matchday squads against Manchester United, Standard Liege and Bournemouth.

In total, the German playmaker has missed over 100 games since joining Arsenal in 2013 for a combination of tactical reasons, illness and injury.

Recent reports claim that Emery has reached the end of his tether with Ozil and will let the ex-Real Madrid star leave on loan in the January transfer window.

However, the midfielder hit back at these rumours by insisting that he plans to remain with the Gunners until his contract expires in 2021. In same interview, Ozil admitted that he and Arsenal’s manager do not always see eye-to-eye.

“I am speaking every day with Raul (Sanllehi), Edu and with the players.

“Our work is more important than our words and really now I am very happy at the club.”
