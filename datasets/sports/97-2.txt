Nigerians in America are yet to get over the loss of ex-Super Eagles midfielder, Isaac Promise, after his club side Austin Bold confirmed his passing away on Wednesday evening.

Nigerians who reside around the same area with the late player couldn’t hide their pain and shock at the sudden death of the former U-23 captain.

Segun Arigbanla, who resides in Denton, Dallas Texas, said it was hard to believe that Promise was gone.

“It is unbelievable that Isaac Promise has gone, I heard about it in the area because he stayed close to my house and I thought it was a joke. Rest in peace Isaac,” Segun said.

Obi from Dallas simply said, “What a loss to football world. Rest on Isaac Promise.”

“I was shocked and dumfounded to hear the sad news about the passing away of Isaac Promise,” Nathaniel from Austin, Texas.

Another Nigerian, Kingsley, who resides in Arlington, also mourned the 31-year-old while sending his condolences to the family.

“Isaac Promise good night and continue to rest in the bosom of the most High God. My condolences to the family of Promise.”

Promise captained Nigeria at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and led the country to a silver medal after losing to Argentina in the final to Angel Di Maria’s goal.
