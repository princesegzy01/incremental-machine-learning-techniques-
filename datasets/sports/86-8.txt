EDO 2020: LOC set to unveil logo, mascot
The Local Organising Committee for the 2020 National Sports Festival will on October 17 and 28 unveil the logo and mascot for the festival billed for the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City, from March 20 to April 1, 2020.

Speaking in Benin City on Tuesday during a meeting of the Publicity and Communication sub-committee, Secretary of the LOC, Dr Emmanuel Igbinosa, said the logo and mascot would be launched in Benin and Lagos on October 17 and 28 respectively.

“After a serious pruning of the entries submitted, the LOC has finally picked the very best of the over 80 works submitted for screening after the Deputy Governor and LOC Chairman Philip Shaibu’s input on Sunday.

The Benin launch will be low key while that of Lagos on October 28 will be a very big show because it will also serve as fund-raising for the festival,” he Igbinosa said.

Igbinosa, who recently retired as Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry Sports and Youth Development, said the LOC was getting set to host a befitting festival.

“We are currently working to ensure that Edo hosts the best sports festival ever, so all hands are on deck to see that round pegs are put in round holes. We have decided to place five giant billboards in five international airports across the country. The five already approved are in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Kano and Enugu,” he added.
