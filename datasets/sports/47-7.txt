After losing Chelsea duo Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori to England, the Nigerian Football Federation is not ready to lose another promising talent in Arsenal’s newest gem, Bukayo Saka, to the Three Lions.

The 18-year-old has been a revelation since he was promoted to the first team this season.

The teen sensation has made five appearances for the Gunners in all competitions, with a standout performance as Unai Emery’s men won 3-0 against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League.

He was also impressive against Manchester United in their 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.

NFF general secretary Ibrahim Sanusi revealed to Soar Eagles.com that the federation was stepping up the Gunners’ starlet pursuit, saying NFF OS’s Amaju Pinnick was working on luring the forward to play for the Super Eagles.

“Pinnick is working assiduously to make sure he brings Bukayo Saka to play for Nigeria.

“Yes, he’s played for the England under-aged teams but there’re ways to sort out his eligibility. It can’t be an impediment to getting him play for us.”
