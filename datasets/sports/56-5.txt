Chukwueze reminds me of Mane –Moreno

Villarreal left-back, Alberto Moreno, says Samuel Chukwueze reminds him of Sadio Mane, his former teammate at Liverpool.

Moreno, who was speaking with Spanish paper AS, on his time at the Yellow Submarines, labeled the Nigeria international a ‘super incisive player’.

“Chukwueze is very good. I followed him last year because I had him in the Comunio (football manager) and he gave me many points,” he told AS.

“That’s why I started following him again. He is a super incisive player, fast, you don’t know where he is going to go out, and he is very strong, precise in his play. He has everything.

“He reminds me a lot of Sadio Mane. I have seen them both in training and I cantell you that he reminds me a lot of him.”

Moreno joined Villarreal after spending five seasons at Liverpool, where he played with Mane for three seasons.

He was part of the Liverpool squad that lifted the UEFA Champions League last season.

Chukwueze has two goals in eight appearances for Villarreal this season.
