Siasia laments lack of support from Nigerians

Embattled former Super Eagles coach, Samson Siasia, has expressed disappointment over Nigerians’ reaction to his current situation, saying he is yet to receive any financial support from his compatriots, as he aims to appeal against a FIFA-imposed life ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sports.

Siasia on Thursday earned a reprieve from CAS after the sports adjudicatory body agreed to extend the October 10 deadline for him to file an appeal against his ban from all football activities for match fixing.

In an audio posted on BusyBuddies, the ex-international said, “It doesn’t really matter if it is true or not because nobody has done anything to help anyone anyways.

“If they (my lawyers) didn’t ask for this extension, the life ban would have stood without any support from anyone. That’s so unfair.”

World football body FIFA in August handed Siasia a life ban from all football-related activities for accepting to receive “bribes in relation to the manipulation of matches” while he was coach of Nigeria.

In addition, he was also fined CHF 50,000 (N18,000,000).
