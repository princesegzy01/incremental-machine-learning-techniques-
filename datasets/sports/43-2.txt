The Nigerian Football Federation are yet to decide on which match venue to host the Super Eagles 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Benin Republic on November 13, the spokesperson for the NFF, Ademola Olajire, has revealed to Sports Extra.

The Eagles were initially billed to play the Squirrels at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, Edo State but the stadium, according to Olajire, has not been duly inspected by the Confederation of African Football.

“The NFF will make a pronouncement before the end of next week on the venue that will host 2021 AFCON qualifier against Benin very soon,” Olajire told Sports Extra.

“And it is between the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba and the Godswill Akpabio Stadium in Uyo.

“Uyo and Asaba are good grounds for the Eagles because that’s where we have played and won games with ease. But we are waiting for the NFF to make an official pronouncement on the venue that will host the 2021 AFCON qualifier against Benin.”

Meanwhile, Sports Extra also gathered that the game will be played under floodlights.

Toyin Ibitoye revealed to Sports Extra that this is as a result of TV broadcast.

“CAF are saddled with the responsibility of fixing the dates and time for the games now due to TV and other things, so our game against Benin will be played under floodlight.”
