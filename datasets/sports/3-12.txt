Solape Lawal-Solarin

Nigeria came from behind to beat Zambia 3-1 in their second match to rekindle their Olympic 2020 hopes after a shock 1-0 defeat to Ivory Coast in their Group B opener at the U-23 AFCON in Cairo, Egypt.

Imama Akpakapo’s charges headed into Tuesday’s clash against the Zambians, knowing that nothing but victory would salvage their Olympic dreams.

And Patson Daka tried to add to the nightmare by giving Zambia the lead in the 12th minute. However, the Eagles replied with goals from Bologna’s Orji Okwonkwo, Huesca’s Kelechi Nwakali and Mainz’s Taiwo Awoniyi.

And FC Tambov striker, Olabiran Muyiwa, delighted with the win, took to his instagram handle to express his joy.

“Good win guys, back on track, the good work continues,” he wrote.

Nigeria are now second on the table on three points, and will take on leaders, South Africa, at the Al Salam Stadium while Zambia battle Ivory Coast in a simultaneous kick off on Friday at the Cairo Stadium.
