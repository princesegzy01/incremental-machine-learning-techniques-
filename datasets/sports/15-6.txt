Pique pleads patience as fans boo Barca players
Gerard Pique asked Barcelona’s supporters for some patience after the players were jeered off the pitch following Tuesday’s goalless draw against Slavia Prague in the Champions League.

Barca had the best chances at Camp Nou, with Lionel Messi hitting the bar and visiting goalkeeper Ondrej Kolar forced into a string of fine saves. However, they were unable to break the Czech side down as they failed to score in a home game for the first time since February 2018.

The local fans grew increasingly unsettled as the match drew on. Ousmane Dembele was whistled when he was taken off on the hour mark and even louder whistles greeted the full-time whistle.

“I would ask for a little patience,” Pique told Movistar after the game. “I know the fans want more, we understand that, but we’re working hard to find the solutions. Not so much in terms of results, but in terms of how we’re playing.

“Everyone has their own opinion. I’ve spent a lot of time here now and when the supporters expect things to go better and they don’t, there is some criticism.

“We (the players) are trying to resolve these situations as quickly as possible. We have to keep cool heads. I think we are in a good position.
