Salah trains despite injury fears
Mohamed Salah resumed first team training with Liverpool on Monday morning, easing fears of the potential re-occurrence of a troublesome ankle injury sustained against Tottenham.

The Egyptian left the field in the latter stages to be replaced by defender Joe Gomez, and was seen quickly applying a huge pack of ice to his left ankle on the sidelines.

Salah however appears to have emerged unscathed, after participating in the first team’s light recovery training session at Melwood less than 24 hours after the match, as report Sky Sports.

Manager Jurgen Klopp had already moved to quell fears after the game, noting in his post-match press conference that Salah’s issue was ‘nothing serious’.

When asked whether Salah’s problem was a worry, the Liverpool manager said, “No. It’s the ankle, the ankle he has struggled with since Leicester game. It is good.

“The longer the game goes, you get tried and you get a knock and feel it more and it makes no sense to push it through.”

The Leicester game in question, as highlighted by Klopp, saw Salah as the subject of a reckless challenge by Hamza Choudhury in the closing stages.

Choudhury was lucky to remain on the pitch, as Klopp later questioned the discipline of the 22-year-old midfielder.

Along with Salah, Joel Matip also trained on Monday morning as he works to recover from a knee injury.

The Cameroon international was present, though did train away from the senior squad in order to focus on his recooperation.

Liverpool return to action on Wednesday, when they face Arsenal in the round of 16 of the Carabao Cup.
