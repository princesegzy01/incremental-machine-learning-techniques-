Joe Aribo and Sheyi Ojo have revealed their excitement after helping Glasgow Rangers qualify for the final of the 2019 Scottish League Cup with a 3-0 win over Hearts on Sunday.

Rangers will face rivals Celtic, who defeated Hibernian 5-2 in the other semi-final on Saturday, in an old firm derby in the final on December 8.

Reacting to the win, the players took to their Instagram handle to celebrate the win, also looking forward to the final.

Aribo wrote, “Through to the final! Great team performance.”

“Through to the Final! Hungry for more,” was Ojo’s reaction to the team’s victory.

Aribo was a second half substitute replacing Ryan Kent in the 66th minute, while Ojo started the game before making way for England striker, Jermain Defoe, in the 82nd minute

The game will be Steven Gerrard’s first chance of a trophy as a manager.
