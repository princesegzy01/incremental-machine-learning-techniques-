Moses Simon was delighted with his hat-trick in Nantes’ thumping Ligue 2 side Paris FC 8-0 in a Coupe de la Ligue round of 32 clash at the Stade de la Beuajoire on Wednesday, Sports Extra reports.

The Nigeria international put in a superlative performance scoring three first half goals and assisted another – for Ludovic Blas – as Les Canaris sealed their biggest ever victory in the Coupe de la Ligue.

“I’m happy with the win most importantly and the goals,” Simon told Sports Extra.This is a victory for the whole team, though but it will boost my confidence playing for my club and the national team.

“We played very well and the team really impressed. I’m working hard to ensure that I sustain this more for the team and the Super Eagles. It’s been a while I did that for the team.”

Simon is now looking ahead to Sunday’s (today) Ligue 1 clsh against Bordeaux, who parade the Nigerian duo Samuel Kalu and Josh Maja.

Nantes are second in the Ligue 1 with 19 points from 11 games.

“It is an important game against a great team, so we will do everything to win. It will be delightful to record another big win,” Simon said with a chuckle.
