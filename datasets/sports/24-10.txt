Monaco to cut loss on Onyekuru
Johnny Edward

Monaco are ready to cut their losses on Henry Onyekuru – less than six months after signing him for €15m.

Onyekuru joined Monaco for €15m in the summer but has failed to impress Leonardo Jardim at the club.

The 22-year-old has struggled to become a regular at Monaco this season and seen himself drop out of the Super Eagles picture.

The former Eupen forward was part of Galatasaray’s title-winning team last season but has been involved twice for Monaco in Ligue 1 this season as a substitute.

He was left out of Monaco’s matchday squad for Sunday’s clash against Saint Etienne and is now surplus to requirements.

“Monaco are ready to sell Onyekuru and Pietro Pellegri outrightly as both players are not in Jardim’s picture for the season,” LFP.com revealed.

Ex-Anderlecht forward has found himself behind Islam Slimani, Wissam Ben Yedder, Keita Balde, Gelson Martins, and Gil Dias ahead of him in the pecking order in the attack.
