Bellerin takes positives from Liverpool defeat
Hector Bellerin captained Arsenal against Liverpool on Wednesday night and watched his side throw away another two-goal lead, but opted to see the positives from an unforgettable evening’s action.

Arsenal came from behind to lead 3-1, 4-2 and 5-4 in the Carabao Cup fourth round, but conceded a fifth themselves in stoppage time before losing on penalties at Anfield.

“I have to say it was great to play this kind of game. Loads of mistakes from both sides and those are things that we’ve got to look at and analyse and you know we’ve got to get better at it.”

Bellerin acknowledges that defeat of any kind will affect players, and perhaps more so when the team was so close to winning.

But that can also be used as a future positive, he feels, and pointed to many instances in the game where his team showed they could compete.

“This is the thing, when you’ve been so close to winning and you lose at the end, it hurts. But this is what pushes you to do better in the next game.
