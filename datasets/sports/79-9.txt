The Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, was in Lagos for another inspection of the National Stadium, Lagos.

Dare was accompanied by Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, following a promise made to refurbish stadiums across the country.

The minister took to the social media to announce his arrival in Lagos and the plan of the ministry towards the development of sports facilities.

“As promised, I returned to the National Stadium, Lagos, and today for an inspection with the Governor @jidesanwoolu.

“As partners in progress, @followlasg is a critical stakeholder in our quest to turn the facility around.

“The commitment of the Muhammadu Buhari government to the revitalisation of sporting facilities is demonstrable. The Youth and Sports Ministry have his support to develop our sports and we are building linkages that can deliver. The BPE, ICRC and LASG are committed to this.

“I thank Governor Sanwo-Olu and his Deputy Femi Hamzat for plugging into the renewed zeal to restore our sporting facilities to the glory it deserve. Not even the heavy rains could deter us. We are partners for development. Lagos is also ready.”
