Super Eagles goalkeeper Maduka Okoye will not be teaming up with the Olympic Eagles in their title defence at the 2019 U-23 AFCON billed for Egypt next month, Sports Extra reports.

The U-23 AFCON will hold from November 8 to 22 in Egypt where Africa’s three representatives for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games will emerge.

Okoye made his debut for the Super Eagles last month coming on for the injured Francis Uzoho in Nigeria’s 1-1 draw against Brazil in Singapore and made a couple of saves.

“I don’t think the coach (Gernot Rohr) will allow that, now that the first choice (Francis Uzoho) is out injured,” Okoye told Sports Extra.

“We have two Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers next month and it will be played during the U-23 tournament in Egypt, so I won’t be joining the team but if they qualify for the Olympics I will join them,” Okoye told Sports Extra.

Nigeria’s Olympic Eagles are in Group B alongside Ivory Coast, South Africa, and Zambia and all the matches will be played at Al Salam Stadium, Cairo.

The team will get their campaign underway with a tough opener against West African rivals Ivory Coast.
