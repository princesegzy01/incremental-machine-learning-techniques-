Chukwueze must be decisive – Carzola
Johnny Edward

Villarreal playmaker, Santi Carzola, has urged Samuel Chukwueze to be decisive in his play.

Chukwueze, a nominee for the prestigious Golden Boy Award has been outstanding since he broke into the Yellow Submarine’s first team last season.

The 20-year-old has scored twice so far this term in eight La Liga appearances and Carzola admits there’s a lot to come from the Nigeria international should he improve in the final third

“Chukwueze is talented but I have seen so many talented kids who didn’t reach the peak,” Carzola said.

“He is always willing to learn and that has helped his progress so far.

“Some things he will learn as he grows but stuff like being decisive in the box he has to start now to be better in the future,” Carzola added.

The Eagles star was handed a nine-minute cameo appearance in Villarreal’s 1-0 win over Espanyol on Sunday.

Chukwueze came on for Toko Ekambi in the 81st minute.

Toko Ekambi’s 17th-minute effort was the difference at the RCDE Stadium on Sunday as Villarreal bagged their fourth La Liga win of the season.

The win moved Villarreal to sixth in La Liga table and they host Deportivo Alaves in their next match on Friday.
