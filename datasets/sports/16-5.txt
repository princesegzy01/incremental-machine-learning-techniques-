Captain of Black Stallions, Azeez Ladipo, has expressed optimism that Nigeria’s national rugby team will emerge victorious in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Sevens starting on Friday in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Though he expressed concerns over the poor preparations for the competition, Ladipo said the Stallions were more experienced than other teams.

He said this before the departure of the Nigerian team to South Africa on Wednesday.

He said, “The bulk of the team is here in Nigeria. It is not the best of preparations, to be honest, but we have to improvise with what we have.

“So far, so good, we have two strength and conditioning coaches, one in Nigeria and one working with the guys in South Africa. Those in the UK should have arrived South Africa by now and we will meet them up and see what we can produce.

“We stand a chance in South Africa. We are experienced because most of the guys who have been there before, so we know what to expect, although we have some new guys too. They joined us last year when we went for the Regional Sevens in Ivory Coast and reached the final.

“We were adjudged the best team in the tournament, even with the new players. I’m optimistic that we are going to do well in the qualifiers.”
