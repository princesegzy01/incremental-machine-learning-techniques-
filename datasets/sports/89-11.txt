Lille can’t score without Nigerian, says Galtier

Lille coach Christophe Galtier has admitted that Victor Osimhen is the club’s biggest threat in attack in Ligue 1, Sports Extra reports.

Osimhen scored his seventh Ligue 1 goal for Lille in their 2-2 draw at home to Nimes on Sunday to take his tally to eight in 11 games across all competitions.

Galtier feels the competition created for places in the team has forced Osimhen to take his game to the next level and the threat of Loic Remy taking his role has pushed him on.

“He’s a threat in attack and unstoppable when in the box and most times a reason why we are solid this season,” Galtier told a post-match interview.

“He has responded well to the competition for places in the team and I believe the team will be better for it.”

Osimhen will turn his focus to the Super Eagles international friendly against Brazil on Sunday. The 20-year-old has scored once in four international appearances.
