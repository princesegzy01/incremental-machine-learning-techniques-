Sodje: Brazil test good for Eagles defenders
Solape Lawal-Solarin

Ex Eagles defender, Sam Sodje, believes the Selecao test is good for the senior national team; especially the defenders.

Nigeria played Ukraine last month in a friendly and were unfortunate to leave Dnipro Arena without victory in a 2-2 stalemate.

Against Brazil on Sunday (today), Sodje wants the defenders to improve on their positioning and concentration levels.

“To have a good defence line can’t happen in one game. They tried against Serbia but, this match against Brazil will further test their mentality when it comes to playing top level sides.

“Getting it right with the players won’t happen in one game like I said earlier but, hopefully the defenders should play well as they are facing a fearsome Brazilian attack,” he told Sports Extra.
