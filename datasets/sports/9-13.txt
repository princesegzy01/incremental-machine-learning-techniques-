Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa, scored a brace as Al Nassr thrashed Afif Club 5-1 in their Saudi King Cup clash at the Al Majma’ah Sports City Stadium on Saturday.

Musa, who has been out of action for three months due to knee injury, started his first game having just returned last week where he featured for just seven minutes as they defeated Al Failsaly 2-0 last Saturday.

He opened scoring for Al Nassr in the 23rd minute before scoring his second and the team’s fourth 12 minutes from time.

Musa has made just four league appearances for Al Nassr this season due to the injury.

The former Leicester City player was included by Gernot Rohr in Nigeria’s squad for next week’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying games against Benin and Lesotho.

He missed the Super Eagles’ last two international friendly games against Ukraine and Brazil, but will be hoping to get a start after fully back to fitness.
