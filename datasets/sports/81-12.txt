Scoring at San Siro was overwhelming – Olayinka

Super Eagles invitee, Peter Olayinka, is still relishing scoring at the iconic San Siro stadium against European giants Inter Milan.

Slavia Prague were on the verge of beating hosts Inter at the San Siro after Olayinka deservedly put the underdogs in front in the 63rd minute of their UEFA Champions League opening match in September but a 92nd minute equaliser from Nicolo Barella ensured that the Italians shared the spoils.

The goal, a first for Olayinka in the European elite football championship, came at a venue which holds a lot of memories for the Nigerian.

“San Siro is one of the most popular stadiums. I used to select the stadium when I used to play video games growing up,” he said on Instagram.

Olayinka admits he was nervous at first, but the feeling of scoring at such an iconic stadium was overwhelming.

“When I got to the stadium, I was very nervous, even before the game. I was thinking of the stadium, and after scoring I didn’t know how to celebrate it. The feeling was overwhelming, but it was absolutely fantastic.”

Olayinka is currently with the Super Eagles in Singapore ahead of an international friendly against Brazil.
