Rio Olympics bronze medalist and Partizan Belgrade striker, Sadiq Umar, trusts the Super Eagles to give an inspiring display when they take on the Selecao in an international friendly on Sunday at the National Stadium in Kallang, Singapore.

The Eagles take on their South American foes for the second time in 16 years, and will be looking to repay Tite’s men in their own coin after succumbing to a 3-0 defeat in 2003 in Abuja.

“I watched their last friendly against Ukraine, it was exciting. I felt happy for the way they played.

“They really looked composed and dominated the Ukrainians, but Brazil is another team, a stronger foe. I believe the boys will raise their game. There is nothing as good as playing against top level teams, Brazil is a good test for the Eagles.

“I am rooting for them to shock Brazil,” he told Sports Extra.

On his international career, the 23-year-old admits his frustrations missing out on national team assignments.

“I am eager for a call-up. I pray I get my wish. Working hard and results on the pitch will speak for me, and when the opportunity comes I’ll seize it,” he stated.
