The Nigerian delegation for the eagerly anticipated international friendly between Super Eagles and Brazil are yet to be granted entry visas into Singapore barely four days to the game, The PUNCH reports.

The PUNCH gathered that the Nigeria Football Federation’s delegation expected to travel on Tuesday to Singapore failed to get necessary traveling documents, including entry visas to the Asian country, despite submitting all required documents.

Top officials in the NFF, however, remained hopeful that the delegation would get their entry visas before Thursday.

“A number of the team officials have not received entry visas into Singapore, but hopefully this will be sorted out before Thursday,” an official informed Sports Extra.

Meanwhile, the Eagles camp in Singapore will open Wednesday (today). The three-time Africa champions are expected to lodge at the Fairmouth Hotel.

The Brazilian delegation arrived in batches on Monday and Tuesday, while a 23-man delegation from Senegal arrived on Tuesday to take part in the widely acclaimed “Brazil Global Tour.”
