Bayern Munich sack coach after heavy loss
Bayern Munich have sacked head coach Niko Kovac.

The Croatian – who led Die Roten to the German league and cup double last season – was dismissed on Sunday night, after meeting CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, president Uli Hoeness and sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic.

His departure comes just over 24 hours after Bayern were thrashed 5-1 by his former club, Eintracht Frankfurt, on Saturday.

That result was only Bayern’s second defeat in the Bundesliga this season in 10 games.

They currently sit fourth in the table, with 18 points – four points behind leaders Borussia Monchengladbach – but have already conceded 16 goals, more than anyone else in the top half.

Kovac had called his Bayern stars in for training at Sabener Strasse on Sunday.

But after they departed, he met with the club’s top brass on Sunday afternoon.

Following that, a club statement was released, in which Rummenigge declared, “The performance of our team in recent weeks and the results have shown us that there was need for action.

“Uli Hoeness, Hasan Salihamidžić and I have had an open and serious conversation with Niko on this basis on Sunday, with the consensual result that Niko is no longer coach of FC Bayern.

“We all regret this development. I would like to thank Niko Kovac on behalf of FC Bayern for his work, especially for winning the Doubles last season. “
