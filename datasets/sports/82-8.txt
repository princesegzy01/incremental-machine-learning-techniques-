Tennis: LOC to reward fans at Lagos Open
The Local Organising Committee of the Lagos Open Tennis Championship says it will reward fans who watch the finals of the first leg of the International Tennis Federation World Tour on Sunday with special treats, while enjoying exciting matches at the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club, Onikan.

Tournament Director, Wale Oladunjoye, told reporters, “We want to give fans a special treat on Sunday. The fans who have our tickets and invitees will be served when seated, with welcome large packs of crisp popcorn free, courtesy of the LOC, for the first 500 tickets/invite holders.”

He added that fans will also enjoy Heineken, the Official Beer of the tournament.

Oladunjoye added, “Heineken is also hosting 100 guests to a treat at its dedicated pavilion in support of the Lagos Open Tennis 2019.”

Meanwhile, a downpour in Lagos on Friday affected some of the fixtures of the quarter-finals.

In the matches played in the women’s singles before the rain started, India’s Riya Bhatia beat Samir Sandra of Egypt 6-2,6-3. Nahimana Sada defeated Stevens Lexie from The Netherlands 6-2,6-4, while Fanny Orthund from Sweden beat Nastia Kolar from Slovenia 6-3,6-4.
