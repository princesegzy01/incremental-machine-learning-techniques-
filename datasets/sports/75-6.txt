A former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Emmanuel Babayaro, has commended the performances of Francis Uzoho and Maduka Okoye during Nigeria’s friendly against Brazil on Sunday in Singapore.

Babayaro said with the performances of the Eagles keepers, the crisis in the team’s goal department was almost over, saying both put up strong, competent and world-class performances in-between the sticks.

Uzoho sustained an injury in the 1-1 stalemate after twisting his leg as he went for the ball from a Brazilian corner after 62 minutes of play.

He was stretchered off holding his thigh and replaced by Okoye.

Babayaro said, “Uzoho showed excellent agility in cutting out the occasional threats posed by the Brazilians and was also alert to foil several goal-bound attempts.

“It was indeed a shame that he had to leave the scene after twisting his leg as he went for the ball from a Brazil corner kick. I wish him quick recovery.

“His replacement, Okoye, also put in a good shift and was not much troubled as he showed calmness in between the sticks for the Eagles.

“I think with what I have seen today, I can confidently say our goalkeeping problems have been almost, if not completely, taken care of.”
