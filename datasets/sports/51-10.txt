Abramovich rejects mega offer to sell Chelsea
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has reportedly resisted an opportunity to sell the club and insists the club is not for sale.

A mega-rich Middle East consortium proposed a potential takeover offer but it was shrugged off by the Russian, according to the Telegraph.

There have been rumours that the billionaire businessman was looking to sell since the UK tightened its regulations on visas for wealthy foreign nationals.

He has since barely been seen at Chelsea matches, sparking speculation that he is losing his interest in the club he purchased in 2003.

Abramovich also put plans to develop Stamford Bridge on hold amid spiralling costs of £1bn

But it appears he has no plans to leave his 16-year project any time soon. It is claimed that Abramovich has been approached by a number of potential buyers including Sir Jim Ratcliffe – once Britain’s richest man.

Ratcliffe already owns Swiss club FC Lausanne-Sport but sources close to Abramovich insist it is “not for sale.”

But the report also claims that the Russian would consider entertaining offers if he receives a bid in the region of £3bn.
