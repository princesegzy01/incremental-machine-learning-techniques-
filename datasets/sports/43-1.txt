The Nigeria Football Federation has clarified that Ogaga Oduko was not dropped for the son of a top security official, Abba Bichi, from the Golden Eaglets squad for the ongoing U-17 World Cup in Brazil.

The spokesperson for the NFF, Ademola Olajide, said Oduko was dropped by Golden Eaglets’coach Manu Garba from the final 21-man list because he (Oduoko) was not good enough to make the squad.

Ese Oduko, Ogaga’s adopted father, had claimed that his son, a regular for the team during their U-17 Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Tanzania and their preparatory tour of Turkey, was dropped by the coaching crew in Brazil for Bichi.

Reacting to Oduko’s claim, Olajire said, “Bichi is a striker; Oduko is a left back. Oduko was dropped for Charles Etim. Oduko was the player that lost the kick in the shootout with Guinea in the semifinals of the U17 AFCON in Tanzania, which condemned Eaglets to the third-place match.”

Olajire, who spoke on a social media platform consisting sports journalists, added “The coaches dropped him after another poor game, against Sao Paulo FC in a friendly in Brazil last week.”

The Eaglets began their campaign at the ongoing World Cup on a bright note coming twice from behind to beat Hungary 4-2 in their opening game of the campaign and will next face Ecuador on Tuesday.
