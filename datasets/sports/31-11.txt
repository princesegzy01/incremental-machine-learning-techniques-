Pellegrini gives Antonio, Wilshere, Fabianski updates
Michail Antonio could be available after the international break as several West Ham United work their way back to full fitness.

Speaking at his pre-match press conference as West Ham prepare to welcome Newcastle United to London Stadium on Saturday, manager Manuel Pellegrini offered updates on the recoveries of Antonio, midfielder Jack Wilshere and defender Winston Reid.

Winger Antonio has not featured in a Hammers match-day squad since suffering a hamstring injury at Newport County in August, for which he required surgery last month.

Wilshere, meanwhile, was not involved in the matchday squad which drew 1-1 with Sheffield United last weekend after picking up a minor injury.

Pellegrini mentioned that the Club are closely monitoring both players’ rehabilitations in the hope that the midfield duo will be able to return to action in the coming weeks.

“Jack is with some small problem. He is not one hundred per cent fit,” Pellegrini said. “I think that for him it is a risk to try to come back before he has completely recovered from that.

“(Michail) Antonio and Lukasz Fabianski are also recovering from their injuries. I think Antonio will be ready for after the international break. All our other players are fit for Saturday.”
