Udinese Technical Director, Pierpaolo Marino, has described Nigeria international, William Troost-Ekong’s contract extension as the most important thing for the club, saying the defender is a great player and leader in the dressing room.

Troost-Ekong extended his contract until 2023 with the Black and White on Wednesday, much to the delight of Marino.

The director told the club’s official website that they are happy to be able to keep Troost-Ekong for another seasons.

“Renewing William’s contract is important for us because he is a player of great value and charisma for the locker room.

“It is an important message that shows how the players are doing well here in Udine,” Marino told the club’s official website.

“It is important to have a similar relationship with players who feel that they are connected to the cause.
