We trust Iheanacho – Leicester coach
Johnny Edward

Leicester City’s assistant manager Chris Davies has revealed that the Foxes have absolute trust in Kelechi Iheanacho despite his bit-part role in the team this season.

The Nigeria international scored his second goal in his second start for the Foxes in the Carabao Cup as they advanced to the quarter-final of the competition after a 3-1 win over League One club, Burton Albion.

Youri Tielemans and a James Maddison late goal secured the win.

“He (Iheanacho) trains well every day,” said Davies in his assessment of the Eagles striker’s performance after the game on LCFC TV.

“He’s scoring goals in training, he’s playing well and is focused.

“He’s trying to develop his game as much as he can through the training, having less game-time. He’s been a pleasure to work with.

“All he can do is come in and be ready. Through his training and through his focus, he’s come in and got a goal.

“That’s a credit to his mentality. I was really pleased with his performance.

“Towards the end he was fatigued because he’s not played a lot and has not started a game for a long time.

“It was great for Kels to get a goal.”

The 23-year-old joined City in summer 2017, a reported £25m signing from Manchester City. He has made 64 appearances for Leicester, netting just 11 times.
