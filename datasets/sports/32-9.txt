FA to investigate Reds over City spying
The FA have asked Liverpool to respond to revelations that they paid Manchester City £1m after the Premier League champions found their scouting system had been hacked.

The Reds decided to settle with City in 2013 after staff at the Manchester club found their network had been illegally accessed. Liverpool’s sporting director and two of the club’s scouts who had joined the club from City are accused of involvement and the FA are demanding answers, according to the Times.

They are said to have logged in to their rivals’ Scout7 database hundreds of times but Liverpool insist the claims are misleading.

The governing body are assessing whether there is a case against Liverpool to follow up, although their research has not been deemed to be an investigation at this point.

It is alleged that Manchester City scout Rob Newman had his account on Scout7 used without his knowledge by Dave Fallows, Liverpool’s head of recruitment, and Julian Ward, who is the loan pathways and football partnerships manager are the individuals alleged to be involved.
