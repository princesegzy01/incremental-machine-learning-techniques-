I respect Osimhen, says Thauvin

France international, Florian Thauvin, has hailed Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen’s impact since joining Lille from Belgian side Sporting Charleroi in the summer.

The Nigerian has been an instant success with the French club, scoring seven goals in 12 league appearances as well as two goals in four UEFA Champions League games, a performance that has seen him win Ligue 1 Player of The Month for October.

The 26-year old who has been capped 10 times by the French national and currently plays for Olympique Marseille refers to the Nigerian international as a great talent.

“Always believe in his dreams, such a great talent. Respect,” he wrote on his Instagram status.

The player made the remark after reading the Nigerian’s interview on L’Équipe where he talked about his football journey.

The Frenchman watched Osimhen from the sidelines in their 2-1 win over Lille last week due to an Arthroscopie injury he suffered on September 11. Thauvin has only been involved for Marseille once this season.
