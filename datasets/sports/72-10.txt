Pillars consolidate lead, Owena Queens relegated
League leaders Kano Pillars recorded a 31-22 win over Plateau Vipers on Tuesday at the Mobolaji Sports Complex, Rowe Park, Yaba, Lagos, thus bouncing back from defeat to champions Niger United to record their 18th win against the Vipers, who have seven wins in the Prudent Energy Handball League.

Also, Defender Babes were anything but their name as they fell to Seasider Babes of Lagos 35-25 in one of the games.

Seasider recorded their eight win of the competition as Defenders had little answer to the forays of the Lagos that was determined to make an impression in front of the home fans.

Also, Edo Dynamos compounded the woes of Abia Valiants with a 41-19 victory in the women’s category. The Valiants are second from bottom and seem destined for the drop at the end of the league season.

Niger United improved their chances of a top three finish by beating Borno Spiders 40-28. The Spiders put up a good performance but they were no match for the defending champions.

Bottom team in the women’s category, Owena Queens lost again to Desert Queens 23-15 to confirm their relegation from the elite division. Owena Queens have lost a whopping 18 games, winning just one, while Desert Queens did just enough to retain their place in the elite division.

Kada Queens put up a good fight against defending champions Plateau Peacocks but lost 2423. It was a tight game but the Peacocks edged the game in the final moments.

The competition ends on Thursday.
