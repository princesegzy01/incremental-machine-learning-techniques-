Super Eagles goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi, has thanked fellow Kaizer Chiefs shot stoppers, Itumeleng Khune, Bruce Bvuma and Bontle Siphosethu as well as goalkeeping trainer, Lee Baxter, for helping him adapt to life at the club despite criticisms from fans.

The 33-year-old has faced harsh criticisms from fans, despite churning out some outstanding displays.

“Thank you for being thorough with me (trainer)Lee Baxter, Thank you (Itumeleng) Khune, for giving me the clue to manage the process, thank you @brucebvuma_44 and @bontlemolefe_ for showing true character of competition to push us all beyond limit,” he wrote on his official Instagram page.

“The truth is we haven’t scratched the surface yet of all that ought to be achieved. There is a lot to still cover, let’s short down our ears like we’ve always done and keep the focus,” he added.
