NWFL hails Wike, Angels on Super 4 feat
The Nigeria Women Football League led by Aisha Falode has congratulated the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, and the state-owned women’s Premier League team, Rivers Angels, for their well-deserved victory at the just-concluded 2018/19 Nigeria Women Premier League Super 4 championship.

The Jewels of Rivers defeated hard-fighting newcomers, Confluence Queens, 1-0 in the final on Sunday at the Agege Stadium in Lagos, courtesy of Cecilia Nku’s well-taken penalty in the second minute.

Falode said Angels’ dominance of women’s football in the country would not have been possible without the support of the governor, especially the welfare of the team and players.

The NWFL boss stated, “We want to congratulate the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, and the newest Nigerian champions, Rivers Angels, for their victory at the just-concluded 2018/19 Nigeria Women’s Premier League Super 4.

“We have taken a keen interest in the governor’s interest and support for the team over the years. We noted that the governor doesn’t joke with the welfare of the team in every aspect of it.”
