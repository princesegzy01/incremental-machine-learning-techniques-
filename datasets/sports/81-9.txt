Brothers at war! Man Utd players snub ‘team bonding’ meal
An established Manchester United player has reportedly attempted to hold a team bonding meal, only for just five players to attend the occasion.

The North-West giants have endured a disappointing start to the campaign, picking up nine points from their opening eight matches in the Premier League.

However, it has been suggested that a senior member of the squad tried to galvanise the group ahead of an important period of the season.

According to ESPN, just five players turned up, including two academy graduates who have recently made the step up into the first-team ranks.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who is allegedly under pressure to keep his job at Old Trafford, will hope that his side deliver an improved performance in their next fixture when they host Liverpool on October 20.
