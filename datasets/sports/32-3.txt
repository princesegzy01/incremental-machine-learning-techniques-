Oxlade-Chamberlain ‘proud’ of Liverpool youngsters
Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has hailed the character of Liverpool’s youngsters after the Reds booked their place in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup.

On a crazy night at Anfield, Jurgen Klopp’s side battled back to beat Arsenal on penalties, after a remarkable 5-5 draw which will live long in the memory.

Liverpool trailed 3-1 and 4-2, having fielded five teenagers in their starting line-up against Unai Emery’s men.

Neco Williams made his professional debut at right back while Caoimhin Kelleher, Sepp van den Berg, Harvey Elliott, Rhian Brewster and Curtis Jones all made their Anfield bows, with 16-year-old Elliott becoming the youngest player ever to represent the Reds in a competitive game at home.

Oxlade-Chamberlain was one of the side’s senior citizens and got on the scoresheet with a 25-yard strike against his former club. And afterwards the England midfielder paid tribute to the spirit and perseverance of his younger colleagues.

“I am really proud of how the boys turned out,” he told reporters. “And especially the young lads on their first starts and debuts.

“(Arsenal) had young players out as well but I think all of those young players are pretty involved in the first team and Europa League and stuff, so they had more experience. It goes to show what quality we have here.

“More than that, it was the character. It wasn’t a plain-sailing game against tough opposition – a big club in Arsenal. A lot of boys could have gone missing or the occasion could have got the better of them but they kept going.
