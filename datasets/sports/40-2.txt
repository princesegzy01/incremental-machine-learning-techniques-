Nigeria vs Benin: Eze keeps Rohr waiting
Johnny Edward

Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr is awaiting a response from Queens Park Rangers’ Eberechi Eze before announcing his squad list to face Benin Republic and Lesotho in next month’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Sports Extra has reliably scooped.

Eze has been on the radar of Rohr following his outstanding season with his English Championship club, QPR, where he has scored six goals and provided three assists in 14 games.

His form has also attracted interests from England’s U-21 coach Aidy Boothroyd, who according to the English media may name him in his squad to face Albania in next month’s 2021 UEFA European U-21 Championship qualifiers.

A top Nigerian Football Federation official revealed to Sports Extra that the 21-year-old has promised to contact Rohr this week on his international allegiance.

“He’s one of the young players we are monitoring and talks have begun with him but he has his head turned on by a promise from the England U-21 coach of a place in his team for the European qualifiers next month.

“Incidentally, he has also assured the coach (Rohr) of a response on his availability for Nigeria at the international level this week after they both discussed earlier.”

According to several reports, QPR could face a battle to hang onto their key asset in the January transfer window.
