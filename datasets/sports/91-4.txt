The North West has emerged champions of the maiden National U-17 Boys Cricket Championship at the Cricket Oval of the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, on Monday.

The tournament, which began on October 3, had the country’s six geo-political zones battling for glory.

However, it was the North East that emerged as revelation of the event, as their scintillating performances defied a decade of lull in cricket activities owing to the insurgency ravaging the region.

The North West topped the table with eight points from a possible 10, after clinching four wins in four games to fend off the South West’s push on final match day.

South West’s hopes of finishing second behind the North West went up in smoke as they capitulated to the South South, who won by 23 runs to sweep second spot.

Meanwhile, North West’s trio swept the individual awards as Paul Pam emerged as the Best Batsman, Chidi Onwubwalili won the Best Bowler and Most Valuable Player and Huzaifah Abdusalam crowned the Best Fielder.
