Nigeria international, Ogenyi Onazi, will be fit to return to action after the international break, after fully recovering from muscle fatigue – a minor setback as he bids to recover from an Achilles tendon problem.

The Super Eagles midfielder had surgery on his ruptured Achilles tendon in December 2018 and has been out for 10 months.

But the 26-year-old joined his teammates in training on Tuesday under the supervision of the club doctor Hakan Ayaz, and he is eager to return to the squad.

“Onazi felt some pain in his muscle in the last two days, so he needs more time to recover,” his agent Ayo Makinwa told Sports Extra.

“He is eager to return and play for the team but that is up to the coach to decide how to re-introduce him into the team.

“Hopefully, he (Onazi) should be ready for the game against Alanyaspor or Ankaragucu.”

Onazi, who joined Trabzonspor in 2016, has made 77 appearances scoring seven goals including four assists.

He took to Instagram to prove his readiness by posting a video of himself in training with his teammates.

He wrote beneath the post, “Steady progress… tiki-taka. Make it easy for them.”
