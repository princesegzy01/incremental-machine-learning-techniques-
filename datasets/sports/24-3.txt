EPL: Unbeaten Liverpool season impossible – Klopp
Jurgen Klopp insists going a full season unbeaten would not be possible for Liverpool, especially if they play as they did in the last-gasp win at Aston Villa.

Sadio Mane’s stoppage-time winner arrived after Andy Robertson’s 87th-minute leveller to beat Villa 2-1 and maintain Liverpool’s unbeaten Premier League record – which stretches back to January.

Liverpool remain six points clear at the top of the Premier League ahead of next Sunday’s mammoth clash with Manchester City at Anfield, live on Sky Sports; Pep Guardiola’s side also avoided an upset against Southampton, coming from behind to win 2-1.

Asked whether Liverpool could go an entire season unbeaten, having reached 28, Klopp said it is not possible, especially if they play like they did in the early stages on Saturday.

He told Sky Sports, “It is not possible if you play like we did until we conceded the goal. It was not bad, it was actually the opposite, it was good football, but it was not the winning mentality we need.”
