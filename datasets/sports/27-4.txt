Akwa United midfielder, Dare Ojo, says they have all it takes to win the 2019/20 Nigeria Professional Football League title.

The new league season is scheduled to begin on Sunday (today) with the 2017 Aiteo Cup champions paired against newly-promoted Warri Wolves in their opener.

The former Enyimba and Lobi Stars midfielder believes that with the influx of new players in the team and the old crop of players and the new coach, John Obuh, things will get better.

“I’m certain that with the quality of players in the team now, we can fight for the NPFL title. The other teams are not better than us. The club has recruited very good players to consolidate on their last season’s performance,” he told Sports Extra.

“The boys are ready to give their best the moment the league begins. It is going to be a long season ahead of us but I know we have what it takes to compete and compete well.”

The Promise Keepers on Monday unveiled 15 newly signed players who will help prosecute the forthcoming season. The team finished fourth in the 2018/19 abridged league season.
