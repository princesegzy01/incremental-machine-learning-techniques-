Victor Osimhen has confirmed that he will be back in action for Lille when they host Olympique Marseille in Saturday’s Ligue 1 clash.

Osimhen suffered an adductor injury in Lille’s 3-0 win over Bordeaux last Saturday and was initially doubtful for the game.

The 20-year-old striker told Brila FM in a radio interview monitored by Sports Extra that he is fit again and will be in action for Lille as they hope to extend their unbeaten run at the Metropole stadium. Lille have recorded five wins and a draw in six home games in the Ligue 1 so far this season.

“I only felt some discomfort around my groin, but I am fit and will play this weekend,” the Super Eagles striker said.

Osimhen has scored eight goals and provided two assists in all competitions in his first season in France.

He also maintained that his goalscoring heroics for Lille has all been down to hard work.

“All the hard work is paying off,” he said.

“I will keep working hard and not let the hype (around him) get into my head.”

The striker, who has now been nicknamed ‘The Prince of France’, also said he hopes to win trophies with Lille.

“The team comes first before any personal ambitions,” he insisted.

“My goals are only important if they win games for the team.

“I hope to win trophies with the team even though it won’t be easy as we are up against many top teams.”
