Ronaldo: I’d only play Champions League
Cristiano Ronaldo admits he is driven by the “important games” and would only play “for the national team and in the Champions League” with Juventus if he could.

The 34-year-old has won most of what’s on offer at club level and is motivated by the games where he can feel the “pressure”.

“I’ll tell you, if it were up to me, I would only play some important games,” the Portuguese international said in an interview with France Football. “Those of the national team and in the Champions League.

“It’s these kinds of games that emerge, those with something at stake, with a difficult environment, with pressure.”

But he concedes that he always gives his all when he enters the pitch, whilst he doesn’t care too much about the reactions from the outside world.

“You have to be a professional and perform well every day, to honour your family and the club you represent, the ones who pay you. For the rest, I do not give much importance to the reactions I get from the public,” he added.
