Man City plot Mbappe swoop
Manchester City have reportedly resolved to launch an approach for Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe ahead of next summer.

The Frenchman, who has 62 goals in 92 games for the Ligue 1 champions, is reportedly open to the possibility of leaving the Parc des Princes if PSG once again fail to succeed in the Champions League this term.

City, on the other hand, need to consider securing replacements for David Silva, who is guaranteed to leave next summer, along with strike duo Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus, with both tipped to find new clubs following the 2019-20 campaign.

According to a report from Spain, the Premier League champions are keen to fill this potential void with Mbappe, who is valued at around £268m by PSG.

City’s hierarchy are said to believe that Mbappe is a player whose talent Pep Guardiola can build a new team around.

Real Madrid have been credited with an interest in Mbappe, but recent reports suggest that their focus has shifted to Mohamed Salah.
