Everton forward, Alex Iwobi, got a five-star rating in the Toffees victory over West Ham on Saturday following an imperious performance which helped manager, Marco Silva, claim his first victory in five matches.

The 23-year-old got nine out of 10 points in the players’ rating as they ended their winless streak.

Iwobi’s energy was a nightmare for the Hammer’s defence and so often he was able to get himself in crucial areas in between the lines.

Silva, who has been asked to play Iwobi in the same role he plays for Super Eagles, heeded to the call and was rewarded with a sterling performance from the Nigeria international.

Iwobi’s performance drew praise from Silva.

He said, “The mobility in our offensive organisation was very good, our three players in attack (Walcott, Bernard and Richarlison), and Alex Iwobi understood where the space was and did everything we planned.

“We had a plan, we saw something in the opponent where Theo could be key for us, with Alex behind the striker.

“He moved it on quickly and effectively. There was none of the sluggish and indecisive build-up of the last few weeks.”

Everton are now 13th on the Premier League log with 10 points from a possible 24.
