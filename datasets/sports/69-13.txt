An Executive Committee member of the Nigeria Football Federation, Babagana Kalli, has said Nigerians need to exercise patience in the ongoing investigation of alleged corruption in the NFF.

Some NFF executive committee members and management personnel are under investigation by the country’s anti-graft agencies, the Economic and Financial Crime Commission and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Matters Commission.

Kalli stated this at the 2019 NFF Match Commissioners Seminar on Thursday.

Kalli said, “As far as I am concerned, the issues raised are under investigation and there is nothing all of us can do without any report from the investigators.

“We cannot do anything concerning any corruption allegations now, because the appropriate authorities are still investigating and we cannot take any decisions until the appropriate institutions come out with a report.”

The NFF executive committee member said the federation was gradually working towards moving into the online match reporting system in accordance with global best practices.

“Our online reporting system is our new innovation, and we are working accordingly with FIFA and CAF on this,” he added.
