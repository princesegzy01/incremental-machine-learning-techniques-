President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to grace the final of the First Bank Georgian Cup Centenary Polo Tournament on Sunday, organisers of the event have said.

President of Kaduna Polo Club, Suleiman Abubakar, who made this known, hailed First Bank for their commitment to the landmark Georgian Cup.

President Buhari is expected to roll in the ball for the final match of the Georgian Cup thereafter, lead other top dignitaries to present prizes to the winners and runners-up at the closing ceremony of the international polo extravaganza.

“Yes, we would be greatly honoured to have the President as the Special Guest of Honour of the grand finale of our international festival that celebrates one of the world’s oldest polo prizes and the Guinness Book of Records sponsorship by Nigerian bank, First Bank Plc, that spans a century now,” Abubakar stated.

“This is yet another bold statement of our resolve to contribute to the development of the noble game of kings as well as impact positively on the physical and mental wellbeing of the teeming youths in the country.”

Already, record entries of teams from the major polo centres across the country are jostling for top prizes at stake in the week-long festival.
