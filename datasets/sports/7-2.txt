Enrique turns down Arsenal
Luis Enrique reportedly has no intention of becoming the new boss of Arsenal at the midway point of the season.

After Saturdayâ€™s 2-0 defeat at Leicester City, Unai Emery has come under increasing pressure to keep his job at the Emirates Stadium.

While there is the suggestion that the Gunners board intend to back the Spaniard, speculation remains over a potential approach for a fresh face in the dugout.

However, according to ESPN, Arsenal will not be able to tempt Enrique into a switch to north London at this stage of the campaign.

The 49-year-old, who ended his reign as Spain manager in June due to personal reasons, would prefer to take on his next job during the off-season.

Arsenal currently sit in sixth position in the Premier League standings, eight points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City.
