Abraham close to new Chelsea deal
Tammy Abraham’s strong start to the season as Chelsea’s main striker is not going unnoticed. Not only that many pundits are praising him and highlighting him as the prime example of what can happen if you allow younger players to perform, he is also getting closer to signing a new contract with his club.

According to Italian football journalist Fabrizio Romano, Abraham is close to getting a new deal at Stamford Bridge. The 22-year-old striker has impressed since being given a run in the Chelsea first team, following Frank Lampard’s appointment in the summer. Abraham scored nine goals in 12 appearances across all competitions, eight of those coming the Premier League.

Chelsea were not in a hurry to offer him a new deal due to the current one expiring – since Abraham has a deal until June 2022 – but they wanted to reward the player for such a good start of the season. The Englishman will get a deal with improved terms and reports are suggesting that the agreement is close to being reached.
