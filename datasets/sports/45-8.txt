“We are working closely with South Wales Police who will be conducting an investigation to identify the initial source.

“The image is shameful and does not represent this football club or our supporters in any way.

“We have a zero-tolerance policy towards any discriminatory, unacceptable or anti-social behaviour, and this will be enforced rigorously before, during and after Sunday’s South Wales derby.

“Any supporters displaying this type of material or behaving in an unacceptable manner will face criminal proceedings.

“The club will be strongly supporting South Wales Police in any public order or hate crime prosecutions surrounding these images and any related incidents during Sunday’s fixture at the Liberty Stadium.”
