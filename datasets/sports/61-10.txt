Super Eagles left-back Jamilu Collins missed Paderborn’s 3-0 loss to Cologne on Sunday due to a flu infection, according to a report on SC Paderborn 07’s official website.

Collins had featured in all seven games, scoring one goal for Paderborn prior to Sunday’s clash.

The defender’s expected date of return was however not been revealed.

In the absence of the 24-year-old, Gerrit Holtmann featured at left-back for Paderborn, who occupy the bottom in the Bundesliga.

Collins is expected to fully recover from the infection before coach Gernot Rohr announces his squad list for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho next month.
