Saka’s improvement thrills Emery

Arsenal coach, Unai Emery, has said he is happy with Bukayo Saka’s improvement, but wants the youngster to get more playing time, which he believes will boost his confidence in becoming a world-class player.

In a press conference ahead of their weekend game with Leicester City at King Power stadium, Emery was full of praises for the Arsenal forward.

“We know we are taking one responsibility with the young players, but the young players need one process to achieve that responsibility and their performance in the team, but we are helping them,” the Arsenal coach said.

“For example, it’s very good news for me about how we are improving Bukayo Saka, but he needs to play, play and play to take more confidence and experience to achieve his future we think he has.”

The Gunners are without a win in their last four matches and a trip to the East Midlands of England may not have come at a good time.
