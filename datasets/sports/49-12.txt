Golden Eaglets coach, Manu Garba, has said the Nigerian U-17 players will do all it takes to win their first match against Hungary in their opening Group B World Cup game in Brazil on Saturday.

In a statement by the NFF, Garba said winning the opening game at the Estadio Olympico, Goiania would boost the confidence of the five- time world champions in the tournament.

The statement quoted Garba saying that “the game is a very important tie”, and winning (the opening game) is crucial in building the confidence level in the team.”

“We are looking forward to the game against Hungary with great expectations of having a good game and winning the maximum points at stake.

“Any team from Europe that qualified for a tournament like this, must definitely be a good side, but we will approach the game with the seriousness it deserves to give Nigerians back home something positive to cheer at the end of 90 minutes,” the coach added.

The Golden Eaglets defeated Hungary 3-1 in the quarter-finals of the maiden edition of the tournament in 1985.

“The quest for the Eaglets to conquer the world again begins in few hours time and dispatching Hungary will indeed be a strong display of intent towards winning a sixth world title, after victories in 1985, 1993, 2007, 2013 and 2015. Nigeria will also play Ecuador and Australia in the group phase,” the statement added.
