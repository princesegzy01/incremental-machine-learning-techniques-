The Nigeria Football Federation has described the death of former Nigeria U-20 and U-23 captain Isaac Promise as tragic.

NFF’s general secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, said the federation was greatly saddened by Promise’s death.

The ex-Eagles midfielder’s death came less than 48 hours after two women footballers of Nigeria Women Professional League side, Police Machine FC of Uyo, were crushed to death by a hit-and-run driver, after a training session in the Akwa Ibom State capital.

He said, “This has been a tragic week for Nigerian football. Promise was a very disciplined, energetic, committed and patriotic player who gave his all every time he put on the green-and-white.

“We do not know yet the cause of death, but we mourn his untimely passing at such a young age. Our prayer is that Almighty God will grant his soul eternal rest and also grant those he has left behind the fortitude to bear the big loss.”

Promise was captain of the Nigeria U-20 squad that won the 2005 African Youth Championship in Benin and finished as runners-up at that year’s U-20 World Cup in The Netherlands, losing narrowly to Argentina, complete with Lionel Messi, in the final.

He also captained the U-23 team that won silver in the men’s football tournament of the Beijing 2008 Olympics, again finishing second behind Messi-led Argentina.
