Super Eagles defender, Ola Aina, is involved in a domestic accident and would no longer be part of the national team’s squad to play Brazil in an international friendly on Sunday.

The Nigeria Football Federation made this known on Wednesday.

Though the NFF did not give details of the extent of the injury sustained, the national football ruling body confirmed that the player would not be available for the friendly.

However, there are expectations that the 23-year-old player maybe replaced by Buraspor’s Abdullahi Shehu and Benfica’s Tyronne Ebuehi in the friendly.

“Torino of Italy wing back Ola Aina is out of Sunday’s international friendly against Brazil. He picked up an injury after a domestic accident and will not be available,” the NFF tweeted.

London-born Aina, who has Nigerian parents, played for England up to U-20 level before declaring his allegiance to Nigeria in June 2017.
