Eagles were too slow, say Lawal, Adepoju

Ex-Nigeria internationals, Garba Lawal and Mutiu Adepoju, have reacted to the Super Eagles’ nervy 2-1 victory against Benin Republic in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium, Uyo on Wednesday.

The Squirrels took advantage of the Eagles’ poor start to go ahead after five minutes, before goals from Victor Osimhen in the 45th minute and Samuel Kalu in the 63rd minute helped secure a win for the hosts.

“I think 2-1 is a good result but Nigerians will be disappointed because we had a slow start,” Lawal said.

“The game against Lesotho on Sunday is going to be difficult because we are playing away from home, but if they can get another win, they will put themselves in the driving seat with six points.

“We had a slow start and that has always been our problem for a decade. I don’t know if it is as a result of lack of concentration from the players but the coach needs to work on that because sometimes if you play against a very strong team, it’s going to be difficult to come back.”

Lawal’s former teammate Adepoju said, “It was a good game from the boys because they had the three points in the bag, though they allowed the Beninese to come out strong at them from the start and they scored the first goal.”
