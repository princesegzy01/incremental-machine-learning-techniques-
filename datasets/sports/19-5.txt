I almost played for Albania –Olayinka
Kelvin Ekerete

Slavia Prague forward, Peter Olayinka, has revealed he almost played for the Albania national team.

The striker made the revelation in an interview with Eaglestrackerng, stating that his impressive form for Albanian side Skenderbeu between 2014 and 2016 caused a lot of debate in the country, with several dailies calling for him to switch allegiance to play for the European country.

The striker who has been invited by Nigeria for their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho scored 16 goals in 33 appearances, a performance that sparked interest in the Albanian football fans.

“I had a very good season in Albania to the extent that it became a debate,” the 23-year-old said.

“The people wanted me to naturalise and play for the country; they called me and were trying to see if I could play for their national team.

“They were all whites; it wasn’t an English-speaking country. It was a massive debate back then in the papers and on the streets, the season was good for me.”

After an impressive stay in the country, Olayinka made a move to Belgian side KAA Gent in 2016, after which he joined Slavia Prague last season, after loan spells at Dukla Prague and Zulte Waregem.
