Garba releases final U-17 World Cup list
Golden Eaglets coach Manu Garba has released the final list of 21 players for the 2019 U-17 World Cup in Brazil.

The main casualties were regular full-backs Shedrack Tanko and David Oduko. They were both reportedly dropped for the duo Oluwatimilehin Adeniyi and Charles Etim, who scored in the Eaglets’ 4-2 friendly win over South Korea on Wednesday.

While the core of the team remains almost the same as the one that played at the WAFU U-17 Championship and the Africa U-17 Cup of Nations, there was also the shock inclusion of Abba Bichi, Olawale Peter and Ojederan Hamzat.

The trio was initially not in the 25-man list of players who left the country for camping in Brazil but made the team despite arriving late.

Full list

Goalkeepers: Sunday Stephen, Joseph Oluwabusola, Daniel Jinadu

Defenders: Usman Ibrahim, Clement Ikenna, Charles Etim, Quadri Edun, Oluwatimilehen Adeniyi

Midfielders: Samson Tijani (Captain), Francis Daniel, Akinkunmi Amoo, Peter Agba, Ibraheem Jabaar, Monsuru Opeyemi, Ojederan Hamzat, Sa’id Ibrahim

Strikers: Wisdom Ubani, Olakunle Olusegun, Devine Nwachukwu, Olawale Peter, Abba Bichi.
