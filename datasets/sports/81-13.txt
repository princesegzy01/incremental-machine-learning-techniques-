Former Super Falcons coach, Thomas Dennerby, has sent an emotional message to Nigerians after confirming his resignation as coach of the senior women’s national team.

The Swede, who joined the team in 2018, was absent as the Falcons crashed out from the 2020 Olympics in a double-legged Olympic qualification fourth round clash against Ivory Coast.

The Nigeria Football Federation in a tweet on Friday confirmed that the Swede had tendered his resignation.

Dennerby also confirmed his resignation, sending an emotional message to football fans in Nigeria and players of the Falcons.

“I, Thomas Dennerby, have terminated my contract agreement with the Nigeria Football Federation,” Dennerby told Goal.

“The decision is final. This also applies to Jorgen Petersson, assistant coach, who was under the same contract.

“There have been 20 very emotional months including the victories in African Women’s Cup of Nations and WAFU Women’s Cup as well as the success of the Women’s World Cup.

“We want to thank the NFF for giving us the opportunity, the players for always being very professional and finally everyone else who supported us and the team.

“We wish the NFF, Super Falcons and Nigeria all the best in the future. Please, respect that we will not provide any further comments.”

While in charge of the Falcons, Dennerby won the 2018 African Women’s Cup of Nations in Ghana and later steered the nation to the Women’s World Cup knockout stage for the first time in 20 years in France earlier this summer.
