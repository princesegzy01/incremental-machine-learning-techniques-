Monaco striker Henry Onyekuru could find himself on the way out of the club in January, according to a report from Le Parisien.

The Nigeria international has found game time hard to come by under Leonardo Jardim since he joined the club from Everton this summer for £15m.

Onyekuru, who has one assist in four appearances, is pushing for a move away from the club should his lack of playing time continues.

“Obviously it has not been easy for me since I arrived with injuries and not getting as many minutes as I would like,” Onyekuru was quoted on Le Parisen.

“I’ll work hard to get back into the team but if it doesn’t change I will consider options.”

The 22-year-old was left out of Nigeria’s squad for Sunday’s international friendly against Brazil in Singapore.
