Emery hints on Ozil return
Unai Emery admitted he is ready to consider Mesut Ozil for Premier League selection after the Arsenal playmaker made an eye-catching comeback against Liverpool.

Ozil was unable to save his side from a demoralising penalty shootout defeat, but was involved in all of Arsenal’s best attacking play before he was substituted in the 65th minute.

The 31-year-old contributed to three of his side’s five goals on the night and produced a sublime back-heel assist which gifted Ainsley Maitland-Niles the chance to put Arsenal 4-2 ahead 10 minutes into the second half.

Ozil had been omitted from the previous six matchday squads and had made just two appearances all season before he was brought back in from the cold by Emery last night.

The Arsenal coach revealed last Saturday that Ozil’s exile had the backing of the club’s executive committee, saying, “ Here we have one agreed strategy as a club and a team.

“Because the most important thing is the club, the team and finding a performance.

“Previously we were all speaking between us to take that decision. I know all the supporters want to know something (more) but now is not the moment.”
