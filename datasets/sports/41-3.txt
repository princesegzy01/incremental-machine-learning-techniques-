Nigerian midfielder Omoh Michael has helped return Mjallby back to the Swedish topflight division next season, after helping his side defeat Syrianska 2-0 in Monday’s Superettan (second-tier division league) clash at Strandvallen.

Michael had an outstanding performance on the nigvht and capped it with a strike, doubling his side’s lead two minutes after Jesper Lofegren had shot Mjallby into the lead in the 20th minute.

It was Michael’s fifth strike of the season, before he was replaced in the 87th minute by Kevin Hoog-Jansson.

The win marks a return to the topflight division (Allsvenskan) for Mjallby after they were relegated in 2014.

The result moves Mjallby to the top of the Superettan division with one game left to play.

Mjallby now have 56 points from 29 games while second-placed Varberg who have also gained promotion to the

elite division trail by two points from the same games played.

They face Varberg in their final league fixture of the season on Sunday. Varberg have also gained promotion to the elite division.

The 28-year-old Michael joined Mjallby from Orebro SK on a loan deal.

He has also featured for Ostersunds and Dalkurd FF, all in Sweden.
