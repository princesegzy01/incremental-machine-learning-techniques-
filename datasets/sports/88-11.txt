Wenger fires Arsenal warning at Pepe
Arsene Wenger has warned Nicolas Pepe he must earn his place at Arsenal.

The winger became Arsenal’s record signing this summer, but he has initially struggled for consistency.

And Wenger says the Ivorian will have to earn his place in Unai Emery’s team on merit alone.

“I like the player and I thought it was a good decision (to sign him),” Wenger told Omnisport. “He’s not yet completely adapted and you have to give him some time. He looks a little bit to be playing not with the freedom he did in France at the moment.

“I see some characteristics of his game, especially off the ball, that don’t happen at the moment. On the other hand, I must say we have good young players who can play on the flanks, (and) that he will have a fight to keep his position.”
