Super Eagles forward, Joe Aribo, has expressed his frustration at Glasgow Rangers’ 1-1 draw against Hearts in the Scottish Premier League on Sunday.

Ryotaro Meshino put Hearts ahead in the sixth minute, before Alfredo Morelos drew Hearts levelled in the 39th minute.

Speaking after the match, Aribo said his team would look ahead to future ties and forget about the draw.

“I’m a bit frustrated, we wanted to go and get the points but unfortunately, we weren’t able to do that so I was a bit frustrated,” he said in his post-match analysis.

“We started slow and from there, we were just chasing the game. We just need to regroup and come back for the next fixture and be strong again.

“To go in at half-time at 1-1 and not even playing so good, that gave us some confidence that ‘look where we are even though we were not playing very well and to go out there and keep playing’ and unfortunately, we were not able to.

“Especially with a result like this, we just want to bounce back and give our all and try and come out with the results.”

The 23-year-old also spoke about his return from injury and his performance in Nigeria’s 1-1 friendly draw with Brazil, where he scored a goal.

“I am just thankful to God that I am able to play again and to be playing again back, I just want to keep performing and keep playing as I can.

“It was a wonderful feeling (playing against Brazil) and one of the highest I have been in football and I am just happy that I am out there and playing, I just want to improve.”
