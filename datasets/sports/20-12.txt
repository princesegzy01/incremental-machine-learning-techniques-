Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, is reportedly eager to sign £86m rated Nigeria winger, Samuel Chukwueze, as a potential replacement for Mohamed Salah, Sports Extra reports.

Salah’s future at Anfield has been shrouded in doubts with Real Madrid and Barcelona preparing a bid for the Egyptian star next summer.

According to Don Balon, Klopp is a big admirer of Chukwueze, who he thinks could be the next Sadio Mane at Anfield.

The 20-year-old has scored 10 goals with five assists in 49 games for Villarreal.

“Chukwueze has good qualities and can flourish better with more freedom,” the report reads.

The 20-year-old certainly looks like he has a big future in the game, and his club have already tied him down to a contract with a buy-out clause of £86m in it.
