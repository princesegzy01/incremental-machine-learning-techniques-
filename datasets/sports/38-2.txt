Missing IAAF money: ICPC invites AFN Technical Director, Adeleye
Johnny Edward

The Technical Director of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, Sunday Adeleye, is expected to appear before the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission on Wednesday (today), The PUNCH has reliably gathered.

Our correspondent gathered that Adeleyeâ€™s invitation by the ICPC may not be unconnected with the ongoing probe in the AFN.

According to a letter signed by an ICPC official, Hassan Mohammed, and addressed to the President of the AFN Shehu Gusau, which The PUNCH was privy to, Adeleye is being investigated by the commission over allegations bordering on violation of the provision of corrupt practice and other related offence Act of 2000.

Adeleye is expected to appear before the panel with all the certified original copies of all the expenditure and retirement made in respect of the 2017 Warri Relays & Confederation of Africa Athletics Grand Prix, which was held at the Delta State Polytechnic, Ozoro, Delta State.

IAAF had in a letter to AFN in March 2017, volunteered to grant the AFN the sum of $20,000 towards a successful hosting of the CAA Grand Prix Competition in Delta State.

However, the international body for athletics, while fulfilling the pledge, mistakenly paid $150,000 to AFN in May 2017, a sum which was far in excess of the $20,000 grant it had earlier pledged.

IAAF quickly wrote to the AFN two months after the payment, admitting the mistake and promptly requested that the $130,000 excess be returned forthwith.
