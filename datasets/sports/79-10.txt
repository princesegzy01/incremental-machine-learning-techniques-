Troost-Ekong: Eagles don’t fear Brazil
Stand-in captain William Troost-Ekong says the Super Eagles respect five-time world champions Brazil, but don’t fear the South Americans as both teams step out in a prestige friendly in Singapore on Sunday (today).

“Brazil are a top team, probably the best team in the world. But Senegal gave them a good fight on Thursday. We can pick some inspiration from that performance when we play the Brazilians on Sunday.

“It will be tough because they will want to win at least one game against an African team on this tour, but we will also want to take something off them.”

Today’s encounter starts at 8pm Singapore time (1pm Nigeria time).
