Ozil not cut out for EPL –Cundy
Jason Cundy has claimed Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil is ‘not cut out for Premier League football’ after his Gunners exile continued on Thursday.

The playmaker was again snubbed by manager Unai Emery for the Gunners’ Europa League clash against Portuguese side Vitoria, which Nicolas Pepe came off the bench to save with two fine free-kicks in a 3-2 win.

And asked about Ozil’s situation on The Sports Bar, Cundy made a very strong claim, and one that is not exactly backed up by the stats.

“Mesut Ozil is not built and designed for Premier League football, it’s as simple as that,” said the former Chelsea defender.

“We’ve seen how well he can do for his national side and I saw him play for Real Madrid and I thought, ‘what a player’.

“You do get that. Some players aren’t cut out for Premier League football and he is one of those.

“You need so many different assets to be a Premier League footballer. In other leagues the pace is slower, physically they’re not as demanding.

“Technically you could argue that other European leagues are better technically. I think LaLiga is a better technical league than the Premier League.

“But Ozil doesn’t have the minerals to survive in the Premier League, for me.”
