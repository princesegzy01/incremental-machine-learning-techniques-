Super Eagles fans have praised the duo Joe Aribo and Victor Osimhen in the team’s 1-1 draw against Brazil on Sunday.

Many of the fans on Twitter hailed the duo for their impressive displays against the Selecao who are without a win in their last four games.

Some stated that Aribo is gradually becoming the new Eagles’ playmaker, while others backed Osimhen to fill the No. 9 vacuum left by Odion Ighalo.

Aribo has been in good form since making his debut for the Eagles against Ukraine last month, where he scored Nigeria’s first goal.

His goal against Brazil on Sunday was his second in his second appearance for the national team while Osimhen also opened his accounts for the Eagles against Ukraine from the spot.

“Full Time: Brazil 1-1 Nigeria. Positives – The scoreline, Aribo scoring again, exciting play by Osimhen,” Chuma Nnoli tweeted.

Israel Omoniyi added, “#BRANGA Dear Joe Aribo, My God will immensely bless you and your football career. You are a talented footballer!”

“Victor Osimhen, one man riot, one man squad,” Eval Edu tweeted.

Olawale Adetula also tweeted, “Aribo’s legwork on that goal was premium. Victor Osimhen is so good, no hype.”
