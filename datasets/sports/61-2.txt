Nigerian forward Victor Osimhen is on the radar of two English Premier League clubs, Manchester United and Newcastle United.

The report comes days after the 20-year- old was linked with a move to Barcelona.

“Barcelona and Manchester United, in particular, follow him regularly,” a report in the French newspaper, La Voix du Nord, reads.

English tabloid, Chronicle, also said Newcastle coach Steve Bruce has been handed enough war chest to boost the squad in the coming transfer window.

“Newcastle United scouts are therefore keeping tabs on Osimhen. The club’s winter talent search is well underway as head of recruitment Steve Nickson and his team look to compile a list of options for Steve Bruce in the next couple of windows,” The Chronicle said.Osimhen has been in blistering form since joining Lille from Sporting Charleroi for €12m in August, scoring eight goals and providing two assists in 12 appearances for Lille.

The striker recently won the Ligue 1 Player of the Month Award for September, on Thursday, beating Monaco’s Islam Slimani and Nantes defender Nicolas Pallois.
