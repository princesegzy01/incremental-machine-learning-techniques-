Lille striker Victor Osimhen won’t rule out a move away from the club despite joining them this summer.

Osimhen has hit nine goals in 17 games for Lille in all competitions, with two of them coming in the Champions League against Chelsea and Valencia.

His rich vein of form has seen him being linked with Barcelona and Newcastle.

“If big clubs look at me, it’s great for me. But I am well in Lille,” said Osimhen.

“The club will decide if I stay or leave.

“I will not object. Playing in one of the biggest clubs in France, playing in the Champions League, is something I dreamt of without ever thinking that it would happen.

“Today is important to me and I must live in the present. I have to go as far as possible.

“I’ve always been ready to take the stage. I had confidence in myself and the experiences in Wolfsburg and Charleroi helped me. The most important thing was to play fast.”

The Nigeria striker was on target for the Eagles, who edged Benin 2-1 in Wednesday’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Godswill Akpabio stadium.
