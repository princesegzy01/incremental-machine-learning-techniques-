The 2nd Vice President, Nigeria Football Federation, Shehu Dikko, says crisis in the football body should not affect players’ performance on the pitch.

Dikko, who is also the Chairman, League Management Company, on Thursday, called for unity among the nation’s football family.

He said the present NFF administration was pursuing the implementation of policies and programmes to take the nation’s game to higher heights.

He said, “We are currently witnessing a period of transition, as against what some people see as crisis. We need stability in the system; we need everyone to be thinking in the same positive direction. We have to acknowledge that unity is key in whatever we do.

“Whatever the issues are, the game itself should not suffer. Every disagreement or conflict can be resolved in the boardroom while the game thrives on the field. Those jurisdictions who appear so perfect have even more problems and disagreements than Nigeria, but they ensure that their conflicts do not affect the game on the field.”
