Walkover, protests mar JAMB football tourney opening
A walkover, protests and appeals on Monday marred the opening day of the third JAMB-organised football competition for tertiary education institutions in the country.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that it all began when the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi queried the eligibility status of their opponents, Kwara State University.

They then refused to play the match scheduled for 9am.

NAN gathered that KWASU were only invited to take part in the tournament late Sunday evening to replace Imo State University, Owerri which refused to show up for the competition.

The match officials then performed walkover formalities in favour of KWASU.

After a series of consultations and appeals, the match was later played and Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi won 1-0.

The Bauchi team, which missed a penalty in the second half of the match, scored through Peter Eleshia in the 55th minute as KWASU failed to convert their chances.

Also, University of Ilorin walked over their opponents from Niger State College of Education Minna, after they failed to clear irregularities in their registration.

NAN gathered that the Minna sideâ€™s players were unable to provide their JAMB registration numbers, which was what the organisers said should be the requirement to play in the competition.
