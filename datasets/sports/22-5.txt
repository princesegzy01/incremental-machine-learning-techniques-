Africa’s fastest man, Raymond Ekevwo, says he started his career as a high school athlete running for fun.

While speaking during an interview, the Delta indigene noted that his family members gave him the necessary support to grow.

According to Ekevwo, he hopes to break more records in the next five years in athletics.

While narrating how he started his career, the athlete said, “I started running in high school when I was 14 years old. Then, I was just running because it was fun but I was fortunate enough to go for the the junior trials and made the Nigerian team.

“My family has been my greatest motivation. For the next five years, I hope to get better.”

On his preparation for the 2020 Olympics, Ekevwo assured Nigerians that he would give his best to make the country proud.

“My coach and I are working towards it. I will go out there and do my best but Nigerians should not expect anything but to just believe and trust me,” he added.

The athlete noted that emerging as the African champion in the men’s 100m at the 2019 African Games comes with “a great feeling.”

The Nigerian secured his title with a 9.96s finish in the men’s 100m. His finish helped Nigeria win her first gold medal in the 100m event since 2007, when Olusoji Fasuba achieved the feat.
