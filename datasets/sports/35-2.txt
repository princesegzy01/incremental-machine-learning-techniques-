Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, on Wednesday released a list of 23 players invited for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho and Nigerians immediately took to the social media to question the invitation of Genk forward, Paul Onuachu, to the team for the two qualifiers.

Onuachu has made seven appearances for Nigeria and has scored once and fans of the Eagles are unhappy with Rohr’s decision to invite him.

Nigerians want to understand why the lanky forward has been invited again by Rohr.

Mercury, a Twitter user opened the trend wondering why Onuachu keeps getting invited to the national team.

“I want to understand why this Paul Onuachu is still getting call ups? Guy has practically contributed nothing,” he wrote.

Defky simply wrote, “He should stop calling Onachu up, that guy can’t play ball.”

“This Paul ehn…..,” Adeniji Segun tweeted.

“What is Paul Onuachu doing on this list again oooo,” Akachi James asked.

Le Gen in his tweet suggested Etebo should replaces Onuachu.

“Paul Onuachu should be on standby. Etebo should take his place in the squad.”

Musa Omosun shared the same view with Le Gen.

“Peter Olayinka should replace Paul Onuachu, the guy is not good enough.”
