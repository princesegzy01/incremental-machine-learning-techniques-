Adesanya wins UFC middleweight title
Nigerian-born Israel Adesanya knocked out Robert Whittaker in the second round to become the Universal Fighting Club middleweight world champion.

The win extended Adesanya’s streak to 18 wins and he has now established himself as one of the biggest stars in the sport.

“I’m real petty, I remember everything like an elephant. I was in the nosebleeds, now I made his nose bleed,” Adesanya said after the bout.

“He threw everything we expected, we had everything for his plan A, plan B, right up to plan Z. It’s unreal, they said I have no knockout power.

“He caught me with a nice one but I returned. I eat it but give it back two times.

“I hate to get hit. It’s stupid to get hit. I’m tough and smart. At the end of the day, my team and I were smart.”

It was Whittaker’s first loss in 10 bouts and in more than five years, with his MMA record dropping to 20-5.
