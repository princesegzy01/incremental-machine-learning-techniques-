Everton forward, Alex Iwobi, has offered support for Toffees teammate Andre Gomes, who suffered a fracture dislocation to his right ankle in their English Premier League game on Sunday.

The Portuguese international sustained the horrific injury on 79 minutes after he collided with Heung-Min Son and was propelled into Spurs full-back Serge Aurier.

The injury left Son in tears, with Aurier and players from both sides also looking devastated.

After supports from both managers and players in the EPL, Iwobi, also took to the social media to offer his support to the midfielder over the injury.

“Wishing you a speedy recovery brother, you will be back stronger @aftgomes21,” Iwobi wrote Instagram.

Gomes, who underwent surgery on Monday, is set to be out for a lengthy period of time.
