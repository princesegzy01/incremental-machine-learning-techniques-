The Nigeria Football Federation has warned its members and officials against match fixing and manipulation in the 2019/20 Nigeria Professional Football League season, which begins on Sunday.

Head of the NFF Integrity Unit, Okey Obi, said FIFA and CAF were monitoring match-fixing and manipulations in the Nigerian league.

Obi threatened that the NFF would visit acts and practices capable of bringing the game to disrepute with “the heaviest sanctions possible, no matter whose ox is gored.”

He said, “The eyes of FIFA and CAF are now very, very sharp with regards to match-fixing and match manipulation matters. Apart from that, the various security agencies in the land are now taking keen interest in what happens during football matches, a development the NFF is happy about.

“The NFF Integrity Unit is now working in conjunction with the security agencies to monitor all matches. It will no longer be business as usual. Members of NFF especially match officials are warned against going to match venues to front for teams.

“It is important that NFF members, including Members of Congress, stakeholders, referees, match commissioners and referee assessors, and indeed everyone involved in the game, to resist and report all acts that may seek to compromise the integrity of a game.”
