Burkina Faso’s triple jumper, Fabrice Zango, was rewarded with a ram for being the first athlete from his country to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships.

The athlete, who posted a picture of the ram’s presentation on his Facebook page, claimed bronze at the athletics event.

Zango said the ram was given to him by the King of Mossi people, Naba Baongo, on Monday.

He emerged third with a distance of 17.66m at the just-concluded event in Doha –where he also broke his African record of 17.58m–behind USA’s Christian Taylor, who won a fourth title with an effort of 17.92m, and Will Claye who got 17.74m.

In Rabat at the 2019 African Games, Zango’s leap of 16.88m was sufficient for gold, becoming the first Burkinabe man to win an athletics title at the continental event.

Speaking about his win, Zango said he was delighted to win Burkina Faso’s world athletics medal, adding, “I hope many medals will follow.”
