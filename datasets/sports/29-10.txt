…Leicester’s danger man, says Rodgers…Eagles star smells danger, does the dirty work

Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, is highly rated by his manager, Brendan Rodgers at Leicester.

The Nigeria international has been a mainstay of the Kingpower outfit ever since completing a £17m switch from Genk in 2017.

The 22-year-old has slotted in perfectly into the Foxes midfield providing steel, guile and cover.

He has become indispensable as his hard-tackling and ball recovery abilities have always endeared him to his managers.

Hence, it comes as no surprise to see his current manager, Rodgers, gush over his doggedness and work rate in a press conference ahead of Sunday’s away clash to Crystal Palace.

“He is an incredible player. The offensive players get the credit but he does the dirty work.

“He has this brain to be able to smell danger and always finds himself there. The timing of his challenge is very good.

“He’s up there with the top players at winning the ball back. When you play a pressing game you need someone like Wilf. His passing is good too. He’s always smiling.”

Ndidi has played nine times in the league, bagging two goals for the Foxes in the process.
