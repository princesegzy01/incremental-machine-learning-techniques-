Home-based keepers can stand in for Uzoho – Erico

Former Super Eagles goalkeeper coach, Joe Erico, says capable replacements for the injured Francis Uzoho are in the Nigeria Professional Football League.

The Nigeria Football Federation through their team doctor, Ibrahim Gyaran, confirmed that Uzoho will be out for a minimum of six months after he twisted his leg in Sunday’s friendly against Brazil.

The 20-year-old shot-stopper will miss Nigeria’s first Africa Cup of Nations qualifying opener against Benin Republic on November 11 in Benin.

“As far as I am concerned, there are over a million good goalkeepers, people keep complaining that we don’t have good safe hands,” Erico told Sports Extra.

“All we need do is to go out and look for them, clean and polish them, and bring them to the top level and the required standard. We can’t just fold our arms and say we don’t have good goalkeepers, they are everywhere.”

The former goalkeeper says he believes the country can get quality safe hands, having trained some of the best in the country in the past.

“I trained over 15 goalkeepers that have gone on to become national team goalkeepers and they did well, so anyone that tells you that there are no goalkeepers in the country is lazy,” he told Sports Extra.
