Nantes forward, Simon Moses, has said he expects a tough task ahead of their match-day 11 game against AS Monaco at the Stade de la Beaujoire stadium on Friday.

Nantes lost their last game against Metz on Saturday and will be looking to return to winning ways having won their last three matches before the shock defeat.

Simon is yet to play against Leonardo Jardim’s side but he is of the opinion that they are a tough team to play.

“The @AS_Monaco? I have never played against this team yet but I think that all the teams are hard to play in this championship,” he said on the club’s Twitter page.

Nantes are currently second on the table with 19 points and are five points behind league leaders and current champion, Paris Saint-Germain.

Both sides have played a total of 36 matches with Nantes winning 11 out of them, bettered by Monaco’s 18 victories. Seven matches ended in a draw.
