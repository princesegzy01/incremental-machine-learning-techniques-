The President of the Nigeria Olympic Committee, Habu Gumel, has charged Team Nigeria participating in the first edition of the 2019 ANOCA Beach Games in Doha, Qatar to be worthy ambassadors.

Gumel gave the charge during the opening ceremony of the Games, stating that a good name is better than gold.

Nigeria is competing in Beach Volleyball and Beach Wrestling in 70kg and 50kg respectively at the 2019 World Beach Games scheduled to end October 16.

Gumel said, “It is a thing of joy that Nigeria is participating in the first edition of this beach games just like we participated at the winter games last time out but the most important thing is for you to compete and win well because a good name is better than any silverware won unjustly.

“Our great nation is proud of you and solidly behind you on this great task as we wish you well here in Doha,” the ANOCA treasurer added.

Also, the board and the executive members of the NOC has congratulated the President, Nigeria Judo Federation, Timothy Nsirim, on his appointment as the Chairman, Rivers State Road Maintenance Agency by Governor Nyesom Wike.
