Garba Lawal, has said the Super Eagles B team lost their second leg African Nations Championship game against Togo even before kick-off.

Lawal, said the team lost the tie in the first leg, which ended 4-1 in favour of the Togolese in Lome.

The Eagles defeated Togo 2-0 at the Agege Stdium, Lagos on Saturday but crashed out 4-3 on aggregate.

“We lost the CHAN ticket in the first leg,” he told Sports Extra.

“As coaches and players, you know that when you lose the first leg with that goal margin, it is very difficult to come back, unless you are lucky or if there is any miracle.

“With the huge defeat away at Lome, the boys were under serious pressure here in Nigeria.

“I can tell that they were tense because they needed to score lots of goals.

“We won 2-0 here but we didn’t qualify for the tournament, no one is happy with the result but there is nothing we can do about it again and we just need to move forward.”
