Brazil draw big boost for us, says Rohr
Super Eagles’ coach, Gernot Rohr, has heaped praises on the national team for a gutsy performance in Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Brazil in a friendly in Singapore.

Five-time world champions Brazil had to dig deep before securing the equaliser as the Eagles went in front courtesy of Joe Aribo’s 35th minute goal.

“This result is a good confidence boost for the team. We now have to prepare for the more competitive games next month.

“I am happy we stayed organised even when the Brazilians mounted a lot of pressure on us in the second half. The only negative thing is the injury to (Francis) Uzoho,” the Franco-German said minutes after the final whistle at the Singapore National Stadium in Kallang.

Aribo’s goal, his second in as many matches for Eagles, was an eye-catching finish as the midfielder waltzed his way through a number of outstretched Brazilian legs, after being fed by Moses Simon, to shoot past goalkeeper Ederson.

Brazil drew level three minutes after the restart but the three-time African champions held firm in the face of onslaught, and could have won in the end had Thiago Silva not upended a marauding Aribo with the South Americans exposed.

Uzoho, who horribly twisted his leg as he went for a corner, will be out for a minimum of six months, according to team doctor Ibrahim Gyaran.
