Solskjaer faces Devils sack if…
Manchester United are reportedly ready to sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer if they lose to Norwich City later this month.

After succumbing to Newcastle United on Sunday afternoon, United now sit in 12th place in the Premier League table, 15 points adrift of leaders Liverpool.

The North-West giants face their bitter rivals in their next fixture on October 20, keeping the pressure on Solskjaer whose side are coming under increasing scrutiny.

However, providing that the Norwegian is still in the dugout, The Sun claims that United will have to avoid defeat against Norwich if they are to keep faith with their former striker

The match on November 27 comes just three days after a trip to face Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League, potentially leaving Solskjaer to prioritise the clash at Carrow Road.

United will head into the contest having failed to win any of their last eight away encounters in the Premier League.
