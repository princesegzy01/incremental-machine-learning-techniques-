Nigeria Professional Football League star, Kehinde Adedipe, says he has no regrets dumping Rivers United for his new club, Enugu Rangers.

The attacking midfielder told The PUNCH on Tuesday that his stay in Rangers had been fruitful.

Adedipe’s transfer in August caused controversy, with Rivers suspending him for allegedly being away without permission.

The player had denied the allegation, claiming that it was a misunderstanding that was settled.

He said, “I don’t have any regrets leaving Rivers because in life we live to face greater challenges. I left there to face another challenge and that’s what football is all about.

“My experience has been a good one since I joined Rangers because they are quite different. The training schedule, the managerial aspects, the culture of the club are quite different. They have plans for players during your playing days and after leaving football.”

Adedipe, however, said he would love to make an impact in the team as they gun to win the NPFL and CAF Confederation Cup.

He added, “I want to be remembered as part of the players that won laurels for the team this season. I felt bad when we lost against ASC Kara of Togo in my debut continental game for the club. I would have been happy if we had gotten a draw or win.”
