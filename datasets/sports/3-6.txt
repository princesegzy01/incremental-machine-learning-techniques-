The Federal Executive Council has approved a bill domesticating the International Convention Against Doping.

The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, made this known in a tweet on Wednesday.

The approval came barely two weeks after the sports minister led Nigeria’s delegation to the Paris Convention Against Doping alongside the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Olusade Adesola.

Apart from Nigeria, about 187 countries are also expected to domesticate the code.

“Doping in Sports: FEC approves bill for the domestication of the International Convention Against Doping in Sports. The UNESCO Convention against Doping In sports was ratified by Nigeria in 2005. With this approval, the draft bill goes to the National Assembly for passage into law,” the minister tweeted.

Proposed sanctions contained in a copy of the Criminalisation of Doping in Sports obtained by The PUNCH showed that Nigerian athletes could face up to seven years imprisonment when the bill is passed into law.

The code categorised the prohibited drugs into three categories with classes B and C having up to five and two years imprisonment as sanctions.

Drugs under class A include cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and methamphetamine (crystal meth).

Class B drugs are amphetamine, barbiturates, cannabis, codeine and methylphenidate, while class drugs include benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, anabolic steroids, ketamine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB).
