I miss Mikel, Ighalo –Rohr
Ebenezer Bajela

Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has said the team is still reeling from the vacuum left behind by former Eagles duo Mikel Obi and Odion Ighalo as they still struggle to fill the leadership role left behind following their retirement from the national team.

Both players put an end to their international careers in July after helping the Eagles claim bronze at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

“We have to find new leaders, we are missing the leadership from Obi Mikel and Ighalo but we have other ones who replaced them and they are passionate and they are able to do the same roles like the other ones did, I hope so,” he said.

‘’Osimhen is starting now, he is very young. Ighalo scoring so many goals was the mental leader of the team on and off the pitch.

‘’Obi Mikel after a great career could finish with a bronze medal, which is wonderful for him.

‘’Now Musa is the captain, if he’s not here, it’s Kenneth or Troost-Ekong, so the leadership is still here and the leadership must be done by everybody not only by one or two persons.

‘’They have a special responsibility because they are captains but everybody is concerned about the leadership.’’
