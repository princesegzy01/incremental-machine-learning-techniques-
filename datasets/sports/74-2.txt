Fans doubtful of NPFL resumption date

With the 2019/20 Nigeria Professional Football League season set to return on November 3, according to the League Management Company, fans of the league are skeptical over the readiness of the body to conduct the league at the stipulated date.

The 2019 abridged league season ended in June with Enyimba winning their eight league title but the promise of a quick return had been dashed with the LMC failing to announce an early resumption date.

The LMC on Monday after meeting with club owners announced fixtures for matchday 1 of the new season but fans are uncertain there are provisions on ground to start the league on November 3.

A huge follower of the NPFL, Emeka Anthony, a newspaper vendor, blames the LMC for lack of organisation.

“We are not organised at all in this country. This date they gave, there is still no possibility that the league will start this year.

“We have seen it happen every season and to me, it will be moved again. Minister said October 20, we heard October 2, now it’s November 3, soon they will move it to December.”

Alabi Jimoh added, “We just have to hope that the league resumes on the stipulated date but personally I think it won’t because according to my own assessment, the new minister forced them.

“The LMC are not even in any way ready for the league resumption. I think we need to shake things up administratively. We need change.”

Babalola Ademola, an MFM FC fan, noted, “The purpose of having an abridged league last season was to try and align our league with the ones in Europe and Africa but with those leagues in their fifth to eight weeks already, the purpose has been defeated.”
