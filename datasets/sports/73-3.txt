Barca tracking German-Nigerian Adeyemi
Solape Lawal-Solarin With Agency Report

Barcelona are set to make a January swoop for 17-year-old Salzburg youngster Karim Adeyemi, a German-born player of Nigerian descent, as they continue their youth revolution.

Adeyemi, born in 2002, has scored five goals in nine Austrian second division games for the Salzburg side feeder club FC Liefering and has reportedly been personally requested by Patrick Kluivert, Academy Director of FC Barcelona.

The German age-grade international, who also has four assists, has been compared to current Blaugrana prospect Ansu Fati.

Mundo Deportivo reports that Barcelona have confirmed to them their interest in Adeyemi.

They say the forward, who has a Nigerian father, could cost nearly £7m after Salzburg already dished out £3m to German club SpVgg Unterhaching to secure his services in 2018.

The Catalan club view the sum as very high for a young teen but are convinced by his talents after Kluivert made club directors aware of him.
