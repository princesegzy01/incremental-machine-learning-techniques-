Ronaldo accused of diving to win penalty
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of diving to win a last minute penalty for Juventus against Genoa on Wednesday night.

The game was filled with incidents including two red cards for Genoa as well as Juventus’ Adrien Rabiot being given his marching orders.

But a last minute penalty from Ronaldo gave Juve a 2-1 victory.

The biggest talking point came in injury time when Ronaldo went down under a challenge from Antonio Sarabia.

There is some kind of interference from the Paraguayan but some believe the Juve forward made the most of it.

However, some have sympathy for the 34-year-old and believe it was a stonewall penalty.

It is particularly harsh on Thiago Motta’s side who had battled with nine men for the final half hour of the game.

Leonardo Bonucci open the scoring for Juve in the first half but Genoa struck back before half time with an unorthodox finish from Christian Kouame.

The last-gasp victory moved Maurizio Sarri’s men back to the top of Serie A and a point ahead of Inter Milan who edged past Brescia 2-1 on Tuesday.

Italian legend Gianluigi Buffon made a record-equalling 513th league appearance for Juve, moving him level with Alessandro del Piero.
