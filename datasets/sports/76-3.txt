Neymar out for four weeks
Neymar Jr. limped off the pitch in Singapore on Sunday after only 12 minutes of action for the Brazil national team.

He barely broke a sweat in the match against Nigeria before clutching his hamstring and heading to the bench for treatment. On Monday, it was revealed the extent of the injury.

As reported by Le Parisien and confirmed by the club’s official website, an MRI scan revealed that Neymar suffered a Grade 2 lesion to his left hamstring. PSG team doctors will continue to monitor the player and assess the injury in eight days.

Their initial diagnosis will keep Neymar out of competition for four weeks but that could change depending on how the muscle heals, and as we’ve seen with Kylian Mbappé, these types of injuries can be difficult to heal. The Frenchman has been out with a muscle injury since August 25 and is only now expected to play in the upcoming match away at Club Brugge in the UEFA Champions League on October 22 according to Le Parisien.

Questions are starting to be asked about why Neymar was even in the squad for Brazil against Nigeria. He had already made his 100th cap for his country and this was in an international friendly.
