Polo: Georgian Cup win thrills Sirika
Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, is in ninth heaven after leading Abuja Rubicon to victory at the just-concluded 2019 First Bank Georgian Centenary polo tournament in Kaduna.

With fans watching at the packed Murtala Muhammed Polo Ground, Rubicon, captained by Sirika, recorded a comeback 7-6 win over the hard-fighting Lintex Agad, led by Bashir Dantata, to win the Georgian Cup title, at the packed Murtala Muhammed Polo Ground, Kaduna.

The feat ensured Rubicon became the first Abuja polo team to have won the title thrice in the over a century history of the competition of the one of the biggest and the most revered polo cups in the world.

The victory made it a double for the Abuja-based polo kings, whose second team had earlier clinched the Emir of Katsina Cup.

“It feels fantastic,” Sirika said, after receiving the trophy from the Group Managing Director of First Bank, Adesola Adeduntan, at a colourful ceremony which had top personalities in attendance.

“It’s such a proud moment; it’s an historical event for Kaduna and polo across all Nigeria and indeed Africa. We want to say a big thank you to First Bank and our teeming fans and to all those who believe in us.”

At the Blue Jacket Gala Night after the event, First Bank received a replica of the 100-year-old trophy it donated for the event in 1919, while past winners of the Georgian Cup were decorated with blue jackets in recognition of their achievements.
