Wilder rips Joshua’s mentality
Though his rematch with Luis Ortiz is coming up next week, Deontay Wilder couldn’t help but give his opinion when asked about former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua — the man who represents tens of millions of dollars lost to Wilder.

Wilder was asked if he worried that Joshua’s fate at the hands of Ruiz could be replicated by Ortiz. Wilder’s opinion was hardly surprising.

“Joshua and I have a different mindset,” Wilder told reporters. “My mindset is way stronger than his. Joshua knew he was going to lose one day. He even spoke it into the universe. When it was time for it to happen, he gave his belts over to Ruiz. He literally transported his belts to this man. His energy gave his belts to this man. You could see it.”

Joshua, in fact, looked lethargic before his fight vs. Ruiz began. Still, Joshua knocked down Ruiz in the third round and looked to end the fight then. But Ruiz landed huge punches for the rest of the fight, and by the end of it, Joshua had been sent to the canvas four times before the referee waved it off in the seventh.
