A Nigerian, Justus Ojo, has been named as one of the Tim Krumrie Award’s finalists for top senior defensive lineman.

Ojo plays for the Hartford Hawks, an intercollegiate baseball team programme of the University of Hartford.

He was named alongside Ben Barten, who plays for Stratford; Cade McDonald, Hudson; Max Meeuwsen, Bay Port; Gavin Meyer, Franklin and Raishein Thomas, Racine Park.

Organisers of the award said Ojo made the list for making an impact in his team’s unbeaten league run.

While justifying Ojo’s inclusion in the shortlist, the organisers said, “An excellent player as a junior, Ojo has become one of the state’s best as a senior.

“In helping the Orioles claim an unbeaten league championship, he has 74 tackles, 29 tackles for loss, and 15 sacks through the team’s first ten games.

“Despite facing frequent double teams, he broke the school’s sack record previously held by Adam Hahn, who went on to play at Northwestern.”

The Tim Krumrie Award is given annually to the state’s top senior defensive lineman as part of the WSN Senior Football Awards. The award is named after Tim Krumrie, a former Mondovi and University of Wisconsin athlete who would go on to star in the NFL for 12 seasons, including two Pro Bowl appearances.

The pre-season watch list was trimmed down to 16 semi-finalists, and six finalists for the award have now been selected. Winners are announced the week of the state finals.
