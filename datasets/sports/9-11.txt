January transfer: Etebo to stay at Stoke
Kelvin Ekerete

Stoke City’s new manager, Michael O’Neill, may be forced to sell some of his top players in January but Nigerian international, Oghenekaro Etebo is not included in the speculation.

This is necessary in order to reduce the chances of the club falling foul of the English Football League’s profit and sustainability rules.

So players such as Jack Butland and Joe Allen could be sold to give Stoke more financial leeway ahead of next season.

O’Neill has been promised money to spend during the January transfer window, but that will be contingent on player sales.

The Championship club have yet to publish their accounts for last season, but they posted losses of £30.1million during their last season in the Premier League in 2017-18, since when they have continued to operate with a high wage bill despite significantly reduced income.

Under EFL rules, clubs face sanctions if they make losses of more than £39m over a three-year period, and Stoke are in danger of breaching that threshold unless they are promoted, and with them bottom of the Championship table, that seems unlikely.
