Arsenal to consider offers for Aubameyang
Arsenal have reportedly promised Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang that they will consider any offers that arrive for the Gabon international.

The 30-year-old has been a revelation for the Gunners since arriving from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, scoring 50 times in 78 appearances for the English club in all competitions.

Aubameyang will see his current deal at the Emirates Stadium expire in the summer of 2021, though, and the forward is said to be considering his future.

According to El Desmarque, amid suggestions of interest from Real Madrid, Arsenal chiefs have told the former AC Milan youngster that they will listen to any offers that arrive for his services.

This season, the attacker has managed nine goals in 13 appearances in all competitions, including eight in 11 outings in the Premier League.

Aubameyang has just been appointed Arsenalâ€™s captain on a full-time basis after Gunners boss Unai Emery decided to strip Granit Xhaka of the armband following recent events.
