Akeredolu, Toyota, others back Ondo Auto Rally
The Ondo State Government and several corporate institutions have indicated their support for the third Ondo Auto Rally, scheduled for November 8 and 9 in Ilara-Mokin, near Akure, the Ondo State capital.

Other supporters of the 2019 edition of the event include Toyota, SMT Volvo, Elizade, JAC, ONDIPA, Meristem, Airtel, Monster Energy, Signatures and other service partners for the event.

The Promoter, Work and Play, Adeoye Ojuoko, said the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, reaffirmed his support for motorsport in Nigeria and confirmed that his government would give the necessary support to run the event successfully.

He said, “We are very happy with the level of support the state has given us. This is an extension of the belief by the governor, that the event can raise tourism awareness in the state, stimulate commercial activities during the period and also hold potential for encouraging investors to the state.

“He demonstrated his belief by partaking in a two-way drag race last year with the Founder of Elizade Nigeria Limited, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo (OON) and that was a major highlight for the event last year.”

He revealed about 200 Motorsports athletes and enthusiasts are expected across Nigeria and from international communities in the state on the weekend of the race.

Ojuoko also confirmed that the Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola (SAN) would be present to grace the occasion.

The event is billed to run side-by-side with the 16th Wuraola Memorial Golf Tournament at the Smokin Hills Golf Resort, Ilara-Mokin, where the off road and the on-road races will be held.
