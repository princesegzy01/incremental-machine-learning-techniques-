After getting a call to the national team ahead of next month’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho, midfielder, Mikel Agu, has attributed his recall to hard work and determination on the field of play.

The midfielder who has been capped seven times for Nigeria, last played for the Eagles in November of 2018, in a goalless draw against Uganda.

The Vitoria Guimaraes combative midfielder celebrated his call up with a goal against Belenenses in a 5-0 win in the Portuguese Primera Liga as the club moved to fifth on the League table.

The midfielder says the call up is as a result of his hard work.

“I was excited because I have put in a whole lot of hard work and determination to get this call up.

“I just have to keep doing my thing on the pitch and if given the chance I will surely give my 100 per cent to ensure that we begin the qualifiers on a solid note,” Agu said.

“I have always put in the work and told myself, one day the coach will notice me again and I will get my chance,” he added.
