Super Eagles forward, Moses Simon, was the star, scoring a hat-trick as Nantes defeated Paris 8-0 in the French Ligue Cup on Wednesday night.

Moses gave Nantes the lead in the 22nd minute to open a flurry of goals for his side.

He added to his goals tally in the 35th and 43rd minutes, scoring his side’s third and fifth goals.

Nantes’ other goals came through Thody Elie Youan with the second in the 30th minute, Ludovic Blas with the fourth in the 36th minute and Imran Louza with the sixth in the 47th minute.

Blas scored his second goal, to make it 7-0, while Mehdi Abeid made it 8-0 win.

Mikel Agu, who has just been recalled to the Eagles squad, also scored his side’s second goal as Vitoria Guimaraes defeated Belenenses 5-0 in the Portuguese League.

David Okereke and Blessing Eleke were also on target for their respective clubs.

Okereke, who was also on target last weekend, scored Club Brugge’s first goal in their 2-0 win over Zulte Waregem.

Eleke also scored Luzern’s only goal in their 1-0 win over Grasshoppers in the Swiss Cup. The goal was his third of the season.

William Troost-Ekong, Kenneth Omeruo and Chidozie Awaziem were all on the losing end.

Roma defeated Troost-Ekong’s Udinese 4-0 in the Italian Cup, while Omeruo and Awaziem’s Leganes lost 5-0 to Real Madrid in Wednesday’s La Liga clash.

Meanwhile, Super Falcons captain Asisat Oshoala was missing as Barcelona defeated Minsk 3-1 in the UEFA Women’s Champions League playoffs.

Emueje Ogbiagbevha scored Minsk’s only goal in the loss.
