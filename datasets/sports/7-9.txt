The President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, says the federation would ensure Queens Park Rangers playmaker Ebere Eze pledges his allegiance to Nigeria.

He said this during an interview on Channels TV monitored by our correspondent on Monday.

Eze, an English player of Nigerian descent, recently accepted an invitation to England’s U-21 team, but is eligible to play for Nigeria at the senior level.

While giving an update on efforts to get Eze to play for Nigeria, Pinnick said, “I have been talking to him (Eze). He’s an excellent player; he loves this country that I can tell you.

“He is a young player, he wants to be given a bit of time but I talk to his dad, I talk to him. I’ll meet them soon in London, we cannot allow such a talent to go.

“And he even told me jokingly, ‘President I want to be the captain of Nigeria someday’, I was so excited about that and said, ‘Why not, you play like Jay-Jay, Jay-Jay was captain so you can be another captain’.

“He loves this country; I don’t think we want to allow that talent to go.”

Eze has scored six goals and provided the assist for another four in 16 appearances for QPR in the EFL Championship this season.
