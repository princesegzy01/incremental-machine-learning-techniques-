Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has backed Tammy Abraham to score goals for England following his impressive start to the season, which earned him a call-up to the national squad.

The 22-year-old was named in Gareth Southgate’s squad for this month’s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Czech Republic and Bulgaria alongside Blues teammates Ross Barkley, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori on Thursday.

It ended any hopes of the Nigeria Football Federation luring him to play for the Super Eagles.

Tammy has scored eight goals in 10 appearances this season and Chelsea manager Lampard during his pre-match press conference on Friday said he is pleased to see him back in the England squad after two previous friendly appearances in 2017.

“Everyone knows his form’s really good. I think he’s been in the equation probably for Gareth all season because of how he’s played and it’s a natural progression for him,” he said.

“I’m delighted for him. I know he’s a proud lad, as he should be proud to get a call-up.

“I think he has all the attributes to go there and be successful but it will be another step for him and I’m sure he has those attributes. I’m sure he has the attitude to take that challenge of being a goalscorer for England.

“And there’s competition there. When he steps into the squad he’ll see that there are great strikers in that squad already around him so it’s a good challenge for Tammy.”
