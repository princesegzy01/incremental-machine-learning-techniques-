American firm rebrands Nike sneakers as ‘Jesus shoes,’ sells out immediately
A Brooklyn, New York-based firm, MSCHF, has rebranded the customized Nike Air Max 97 sneakers, filled the soles with water and rechristened them ‘Jesus Shoes.’

The novelty sold out immediately, online media platforms had reported.

According to the MSCHF CEO, Mr. Gabriel Whaley, who said some people regard him as a “dickhead,” the idea of ‘water in the shoes’ was to give wearers the experience of walking on water — like Jesus and Peter did in Matthew 14:25.

An Instagram verified account holder who seems to know much about the ‘holy’ shoes, #hypebeastdrops, disclosed that MSCHF actually filled the shoes with 60cc of water that was originally sourced from the River Jordan and then blessed.

“This means the wearers are able to, theoretically, walk on holy water,” hypebeastdrops wrote on Instagram.

The shoes were also scented with frankincense, while they are accessorized with a steel crucifix on the shoelaces.

“Rounding off this godly pair is a shoe box that features a seal that is modified from the official Papal Seal, and an angel on the box that is excerpted from Melencolia, a 1514 engraving by the German Renaissance artist, Albrecht Dürer.

The heavenly pair will only set the buyer back by N514,425 or, if you would, $1,425.
