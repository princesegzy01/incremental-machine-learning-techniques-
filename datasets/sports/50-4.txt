Despite scoring a consolatory goal in Genk’s 4-1 UEFA Champions League loss to champions Liverpool at the Luminus Arena, Nigerian striker, Stephen Odey, says he is excited at grabbing his first goal in Europe’s most prestigious league.

Salah scored Liverpool’s fourth goal in the 87th minute with the champions thinking they had ended the tie with a clean sheet, but the Nigerian pulled one back for the home team in the 88th minute, his first goal for the club in the Champions league in his first UCL appearance.

Odey, who replaced compatriot Paul Onuachu in the 81st minute, says it’s a dream come through scoring against such an illustrious opponent.

“Scoring against Liverpool in the Champions League feels really good; it’s just like a dream come through for me and I’m so happy.

“Liverpool are the defending champions, we expected a good game from them because we all aspire to be as good as them someday,” he told Genk’s website.

Odey believes the result could have been better if they had taken their chances in the first half but says they will work harder ahead of their next fixtures.

“We were unlucky not to have scored in the first half, that’s the game of football; we just have to work harder ahead of our upcoming games.”

Odey joined the Belgian champions in the summer from Swiss side FC Zurich.
