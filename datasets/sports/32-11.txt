Solskjaer praises Williams after Chelsea win
Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was full of praise for Brandon Williams after his side’s 2-1 win against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup at Stamford Bridge.

Marcus Rashford’s double, which included a stunning long-range free-kick, sent United through to the quarter-finals where they’ll face League Two side Colchester.

The victory was United’s third win on the bounce away from home and the victories have helped to ease the pressure on Solskjaer’s position. But while the performances of Rashford and Scott McTominay were highlights for Solskjaer last night, it was Williams’ display that pleased him most.

“Whenever you get results it will give players confidence. But when you give young lads like Brandon Williams the experience and that kid was again outstanding, it’s only gonna help them,” said Solskjaer.

“We know we’re not the finished product, a work in process and keep trying to improve. They’re learning, getting new experiences, we want to win every game, when you play for Man United you’re expected to win every game.”

Solskjaer must now decide whether to stick with Williams for Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth or to reinstate Ashley Young at left-back. United played with a back three for the third time in four matches in west London and could do so again on the south coast.
