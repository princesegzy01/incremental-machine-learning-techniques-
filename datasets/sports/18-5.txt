Turkish club Fenerbahce have set their sights on signing Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa when the January transfer window opens, Sports Extra reports.

The 26-year-old, who returned from a two months injury layoff on Saturday, was linked with the Yellow Canaries last summer before he opted to join Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr.

According to Turkish paper, Fanatik, Fenerbahce are hoping to boost their attacking options and they see Musa as a good back-up for Vedat Muriqi and Mevlut Erdnc.

The paper quoted Fenerbahçe president Ali Koc as saying that the club are in search of a player of different quality to Vedat Muriqi and Mevlut Erdnc in the attack.

He said, “Mevlut is a good player but we must be stronger on the way to the championship. If anything happens to Vedat, it is very difficult for us to go with Mevlut.

“We should add another name to the squad and Musa is a good option. We will see in January.”

Fenerbahce also have in their ranks former Eagles winger, Victor Moses, who is on loan from Chelsea.

Musa is expected to lead the Eagles squad out when they kick-off their 2021 Africa Nations Cup qualifiers against Benin Republic and Lesotho later this month.

He missed the friendly matches against Ukraine and Brazil through injury.
