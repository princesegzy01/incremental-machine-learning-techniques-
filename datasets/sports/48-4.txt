Silva plans to improve Toffees away form
Marco Silva has demanded an improvement in Everton’s away form as they look to get their season back on track.

The Toffees will head to Brighton on Saturday seeking their first league win on the road since March, a record Silva recognises is holding back his side as they sit just two points clear of the relegation zone.

Last week’s 2-0 win over West Ham at Goodison Park lifted some of the considerable pressure off Silva’s shoulders, but he knows his side need to put together a string of results if they are to make rapid progress up a table which remains highly congested – with Everton only four points off sixth.

“What we have been doing away is not good enough,” said Silva. “We have the quality to do more and must do more.

“We have to look at this game (at Brighton) thinking it has to be our first away win, the game we play to score more goals – because we are not scoring enough goals away – and be solid as a team.

“With this desire to score goals and be solid we can win away games in the Premier League.

“We must improve our away form because we have to support the work we are doing and the points we are getting at home with good results and performances away.”
