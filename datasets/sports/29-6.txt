Barca presidency an ambition –Pique
Barcelona defender Gerard Pique admits being club president is an ambition.

Pique said he’s enjoying his football at the moment and is only thinking year by year.

“Thinking about the future would be crazy,” he said. “The day I stop being important for the team, it will be time to step aside. I have a contract until 2022 when I will be 35.”

Asked about his desire to then be Barça president, he added, “Short-term, I don’t see myself as the president. It’s not something I want to get involved with right now. I’ve always wanted to do it, but in the short or medium-term, I don’t see it. If one day I am, I hope to do it well. I would have to make a lot of changes.

“But now it’s time to change other things, like tennis. I don’t see myself as a coach, my passion for Barça and love for the club is everything. Right now it’s incompatible Kosmos and (being) Barça (president).”
