Messi pondered Barca exit
Lionel Messi has confessed he considered leaving Barcelona in the midst of his trial on tax irregularities due to ‘mistreatment’.

Three years ago, the Argentine star was found guilty, alongside his father, of defrauding the tax authorities in Spain of €4.1m between 2007 and 2009.

The most difficult period was between 2013 and 2014 when the problems came up with the Spanish tax authorities, that was tough on me and my family,” Messi confirmed in an interview with Catalan Radio Rac 1.

“It was so tough because I was the first (high-profile footballer) to go through that process, it felt like by being very thorough and tough with me, they would then do the same for all the footballers.

“That was when I thought about leaving Barcelona, not because I wanted to leave the club but I wanted to leave Spain – I felt that I was being mistreated and I did not want to stay there.”
