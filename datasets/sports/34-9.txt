Iheanacho’s goal delights Fuchs
Ebenezer Bajela

Leicester and Super Eagles player, Kelechi Iheanacho, was a happy figure on Tuesday as the Foxes defeated Burton 3-1 in the Carabao Cup at the Pirelli Stadium.

The Nigeria international made his second appearances of the season as he was in the starting eleven and he scored his team’s opening goal just seven minutes into the game much to the delight of his teammate, Christian Fuchs, who praised the 23-year-old.

The former Austrian international took to Twitter to express his joy at Iheanacho’s goal.

“Well done @67Kelechi. Happy for you my man!” he tweeted.

“Celebrations for @67Kelechi and Tielemans’ goals!”

The goal was Iheanacho second goal in the competition having scored in the third round win over Luton Town.

Iheanacho has been restricted to just two appearances for Leicester this campaign but will be hoping his goal against Burton on Tuesday will give him a chance to be included in Rodgers squad when they travel to Selhurst Park to take on Crystal Palace in the Premier League game on Saturday.
