Fans have hailed Nigerian Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter, Israel Adesanya, after he prostrated for his parents after emerging the undisputed middleweight world champion on Sunday.

Adesanya knocked out Robert Whittaker in the second round to emerge as UFC middleweight world champion.

A video uploaded on social media showed Adesanya prostrating to greet his parents, who attended the fight. He also placed the belt on this mother’s shoulder.

The gesture elicited reactions from Nigerians on Twitter, who praised him for extolling the Yoruba culture of respect for parents.

“I love the humility, I love you for showing up the culture. I guess you will put on agbada to the stage one day,” Oluwatimilehin Dada tweeted.

“I am proud of you bro, watching you and the way you represent our culture while winning gives me joy,” Josy Adejo also added.

“Israel prostrates before his parents as a sign of respect and regard to them. It’s the African way. He just gave motherland an independence Day gift. Congrats Nigeria,” Emma Ogheneovo tweeted.

“Well trained by parents, well trained by coach. You are the champion,” Charles Egbude also said.

“I wish people know what that is though. Gave his father the complete respect in front of people,” Temi Alabi said.
