Gunners’ fans crave Ndidi at Emirates

Wilfred Ndidi’s stellar performance for Leicester City has caught the attention of Arsenal fans, who have urged their club to sign the midfielder following his brilliant displays in the Foxes’ 9-0 win over Southampton on Friday night.

Youri Tielemans, Ben Chilwell, Jamie Vardy, Ayoze Perez and James Maddison were all excellent for the Midlands side, but the one player that caught the eyes of Arsenal fans was the Nigerian midfielder.

Arsenal fans on Saturday took to Twitter to call for the Gunners’ board to sign the 22-year-old in the near future.

A Twitter user with the name Akpofure begged the Arsenal board to sign Ndidi.

“Please sign Ndidi @Arsenal,” he wrote.

Walt Banger wrote, “Give them Ozil and Xhaka and see what happens. We can take Madison and Ndidi.”

“Would love to have Ndidi and Maddison at Arsenal,” another Arsenal fan Afcbreezy stated.

Igbalode Omoalhaja, an Arsenal supporter, believes Ndidi is better than Granit Xhaka.

“Just sell Xhaka and bring in Ndidi. We need to go all out for him. We have no shield. Xhaka is a statue, he stands to receive ball and just pass it on that same spot.”

Paul Arsenal simply wrote, “Arsenal I hope we are watching Ndidi.”

Guccini tweeted, “Xhaka + £50mill for Ndidi @Arsenal.”

“Arsenal need to get Ndidi in next season,” Meroe added.

Ndidi has been a mainstay in Brendan Rogers’ team, who are currently third on the EPL table with 20 points from 10 games.
