Emmanuel Dennis and compatriot David Okereke have both been listed in Club Brugge’s matchday four squad to face French Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday’s (today) Champions League clash in Paris, Sports Extra reports.

The duo and their club teammates suffered a humiliating 5-0 loss at home to the Le Parisians at the Jan Breydel stadium a fortnight ago and will be praying to avoid another annihilation.

Dennis, who scored a brace in Brugge’s 2-2 draw against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on matchday two, will look to add to his tally of six this season.

Okereke on his part will aim to score his debut goal in the competition for Brugge.

The 22-year-old has scored in his last three consecutive league games and will relish his chance to notch his 10th goal of the season should he make his 20th appearance across all competitions.

He, however, remains upbeat on his team’s chances.

“We have nothing to lose now. We must play and play without fear,” he told Sports Extra.

“We look forward to Wednesday and hopefully we will give a good account of ourselves.”

In Russia, Bryan Idowu will hope to keep his place in Locomotiv Moscow’s squad when they host Juventus.

Idowu saw 90 minutes of action in the reverse fixture in Turin a fortnight ago, where the Italian champions won 2-1, will be looking to deny the Old Lady back-to-back wins in Group D.

Juventus have won all three previous meetings with Lokomotiv and will qualify with another win.

Lokomotiv, on the other hand, could already be out of the tournament, depending on the result between Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen in the other fixture.
