Johnny Edward

Gernot Rohr has been handed a double boost ahead of Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho with the pair of Kenneth Omeruo and Samuel Kalu back to full fitness.

The duo missed the Super Eagles’ last game against Brazil in Singapore but returned to action for their respective clubs (Leganes and Bordeaux) on Sunday.

Bordeaux winger Kalu played for 55 minutes on his ninth Ligue 1 appearance for his team, who lost 1-0 to Saint-Etienne before he was replaced for Hwang Ui-Jo.

Omeruo on his part featured for the entire duration of Leganes’ 2-0 away at Getafe.

The Eagles will face Benin Republic on November 11, before they battle Lesotho in their match-day two AFCON qualifier in Maseru.

The top two teams from each of the 12 groups will qualify for AFCON 2021 in Cameroon.
