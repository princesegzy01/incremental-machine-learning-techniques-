Usyk wants to fight against Joshua
Oleksandr Usyk says he wants to fight Anthony Joshua next after beating Chazz Witherspoon in his heavyweight debut.

The undisputed cruiserweight world champion made his first appearance at heavyweight in Chicago on Saturday.

In a dominant display, Usyk forced Witherspoon to retire on his stool after the end of the seventh round.

Usyk was officially made mandatory challenger for the WBO heavyweight title earlier this year and the 32-year-old admits he is keen to face Joshua after his rematch against Andy Ruiz Jr in December.

Asked who he preferred to face, Usyk replied, ‘I think Joshua. I think I will add more weight, and we have time to add more weight.

“But adding more weight is absolutely no problem, the problem will be in the speed adding the weight.

“So we need to do that properly, we need to do that with timing, in the right way to add the weight, we don’t want to lose the boxing skills.”
