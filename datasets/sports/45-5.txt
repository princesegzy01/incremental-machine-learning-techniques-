Five-time World Champions Nigeria came back twice to beat Hungary 4-2 in their opening match of the 2019 U-17 World Cup in Brazil.

Gyorgy Komaromi scored the opener for the Europeans in the third minute of the encounter but Nigeria equalised from the spot through captain Samson Tijani in the 20th minute but lack of communication in the Eaglets defence saw Hungary take the lead again through Samuel Major as the Europeans head into the half time break with a valuable lead.

The patience of the Eaglets was rewarded with the boys scoring two goals with two minutes. Usman Ibrahim equalised in the 79th minute while Oluwatimilehin Adeniyi scored Nigeria’s third goal of the game as the Nigerians took the lead for the first time.

Samson Tijani scored his brace in the 85th minute to hand Nigeria a well-deserved win.

Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare has congratulated the team on their win.

“Congratulations Golden Eaglets! Truly golden. There’s no killing the Nigerian spirit,” he tweeted.

Nigeria will next face Ecuador on Tuesday October 29.
