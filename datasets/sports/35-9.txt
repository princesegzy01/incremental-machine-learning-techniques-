The winners of the Nigeria Women’s Premier League Super 4 tournament will travel to Spain for one-week training tour, NWFL President, Aisha Falode, has stated.

The 2018/19 NWPL Super 4 matches will kick off on Friday with – Rivers Angels, Bayelsa Queens, Adamawa Queens and Confluence Queens set to battle for the coveted prize.

The third place and final matches will hold on Sunday at the Agege Stadium.

Falode also revealed that an agreement has been reached with La Liga to train NWPL coaches.

“The partnership with La Liga is not monetary but technical. The winner of the 2019 NWPL Super 4 will go on a one week tour to Spain.

“We also have an agreement with La Liga to send in technical experts from Spain to train NWPL Coaches as we want them updated and upgraded.

She also lamented the low turnout of fans at the venue of the games and also explained why the NWPL games are not on TV.

“The only support we get in Nigeria is only on social media. Even when we make entrance free and make publicity people still don’t come out to watch but they easily condemn and suggest solutions to problems they have no idea of.

“Having games on TV is very expensive, to show a game live on TV will cost as much as N9m. When the La Liga first started, it was only one TV Station that offered to show the matches free.”
