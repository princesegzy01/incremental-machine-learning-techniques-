Silva: Lookman forced Everton exit

EVERTON manager, Marco Silva, has revealed his disappointment at Ademola Lookman’s exit, reinforcing that he didn’t want to sell the England U-20 international to RB Leipzig this season.

Lookman had joined Everton from Charlton Athletic in 2017 and was tipped for greatness, but he struggled to nail down a shirt at Goodison Park, and needed a Leipzig loan switch to play first team football.

Lookman returned to Goodison Park in 2018, but his situation didn’t change as he only made two appearances and scored one goal before agreeing a return to the Red Bull Arena in a deal worth £23m.

But Silva has now opened up on what happened, insisting it was the player’s wish to quit Merseyside.

“He spoke to me at the end of the season about what he wanted to do and what was his desire,” Silva told the ECHO.

“Like you know, at the beginning of last season he spoke to me about his desire to leave the club. I said no, no and no, even if we received a very good offer to sell him, for our structure, no because I saw in him, and I keep seeing in him…(his quality).

“If you are asking me about my technical point of view, if I would like to sell him, I will say no.

“At the end of last season he came to see me in my office, to tell me what he was thinking, about his desire, his future and what he would like to do.

“I respect his opinion but I said to him ‘you are in my plans again’.’

Lookman is yet to hit the ground running at Red Bull Arena, having made just two appearances for the club so far this season.
