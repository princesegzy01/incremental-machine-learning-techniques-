Arsenal squad fully behind Xhaka – Martínez
Emiliano Martínez has said that the Arsenal squad is fully behind Granit Xhaka after the captain clashed with club’s fans last weekend.

The 27-year-old, who was in goal for Arsenal for their remarkable Carabao Cup fourth-round tie against Liverpool on Wednesday, which they lost 5-4 on penalties after a 5-5 draw, added that Xhaka was a “lovely” person who cared deeply about the club.

The Switzerland international gestured and swore at the crowd as he was substituted in the 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace on Sunday, with Unai Emery later admitting that the club had suggested the midfielder should apologise to the fans. No apology has been forthcoming and the player has changed his Instagram profile picture to one of him in a Switzerland kit rather than an Arsenal one.

Despite the fallout, Martínez is adamant that the players are still backing the captain. Asked whether they had spoken to the Xhaka, he said: “We always do, all of us. He’s a lovely guy, he’s a bit devastated because he has got a good family, a good heart and he loves the club. When someone goes through that, we have to support him and we are together.”
