The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board has pledged to look into the hitches encountered in its ongoing Tertiary Institutions’ Football Championship in Ilorin.

JAMB made this known on Wednesday while responding to concerns raised by followers of the tournament.

A walkover, protests and appeals marred the opening day of the third JAMB-organised football competition on Monday.

While the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi protested the eligibility status of their opponents, Kwara State University, University of Ilorin walked over their opponents from Niger State College of Education Minna, after they failed to clear irregularities in their registration.

“We appreciate your critical view of the event. Our kind intention is to support the growth of talents in our institutions. However, we will raise this concern with the organisers,” JAMB tweeted on Thursday, while responding to a complaint on the poor organisation of the tournament.

The tournament between 16 teams, comprising five universities, five polytechnics and five colleges of education, is being sponsored by JAMB with N25m.

The winners are expected to win N1m, first runners-up will get N750, 000, while the second runners-up will go home with N500,000.
