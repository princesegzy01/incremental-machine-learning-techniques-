Confluence queen midfielder, Ramat Abdulkareem, has sealed a one-year deal with a 12-month extension option with Turkish KadÄ±nlar Ligi side, Adana Idmanyurduspor, reports goal.com.

Abdulkareem sealed her first move to Europe following a successful trial with the Turkish side.

Renowned for her brilliant passes, and presence in the midfield, the 20-year-old will be eager to help her new teammates climb out of relegation zone.

Adana are stuck at the bottom and currently pointless after three games.

Abdulkareem starred for Nasarawa Amazons, Abia Angels and Adamawa Queens in Nigeria, and was instrumental to the Confluence queens qualification to the Super Four event this season.

She becomes the second Nigerian at the club after striker Queen Ijeoma, who left the country in 2008.
