Juve in search of next CR7
…Budget £260m for mission

Juventus might boast one of the most talented players on the planet, but they are already looking to track down the next Cristiano Ronaldo, as they prepare £260million to snare some of the best prospects in Europe.

The Old Lady are seeking to conquer the continent over the next few years and with Portuguese star not getting any younger at 34, they are sizing up young stars who could spearhead the club going into the future – with PSG’s Kylian Mbappe and Erling Haaland both targets.

Red Bull Salzburg starlet Haaland has been turning heads this season – the 19-year-old netting 20 goals already and is the top scorer in the Champions League with six.

And Mbappe, who scored and won the World Cup with France as a teenager, has long held many admirers since bursting on the scene with his scintillating pace and prowess in front of goal.

Paolo Aicardi, president of Juve’s shareholders, has mapped out the club’s three year plan to usher in a new generation of stars as they look to maintain their stranglehold on Serie A whilst also becoming regular favourites for the Champions League.

‘Ronaldo was the end point of a plan that started eight years ago when [Mirko] Vucinic was our star signing,’ he said at the club’s annual meeting.

‘‘From him to Cristiano there were various steps: [Carlos] Tevez, [Sami] Khedira… these signings show that Juventus are bringing in the biggest names in football.’’

Aicardi said Ronaldo’s big-money move to Turin in 2018 proved that Juventus have become true European heavyweights and hold as much allure as the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona.

He added that the signing of Dutch sensation Matthijs De Ligt last year was the first step of the club’s action plan, and are now seeking a ‘new Cristiano Ronaldo’ who can win games out of nothing.
