Arsenal legend Ian Wright says Gunners youngster Bukayo Saka will learn from his mistakes after the forward was handed a yellow card for simulation in the 18-yard box during Monday’s 1-0 defeat at Sheffield United.

Shortly after Mousset’s goal in the 30th minute, the Gunners had a penalty appeal turned down as Saka appeared to be scythed down by Blades’ centre-back John Egan.

However, referee Mike Dean immediately showed Saka a yellow card and replays showed there was minimal contact made before he went down.

Reacting to the referee’s decision, the Arsenal legend confirmed that Dean’s decision was correct but is hopeful the youngster will learn from the mistake he made.

“You can see there’s no contact, nothing, he’s actually started to jump before the defender planted his foot,” Wright told BTSports.

“He’s young and he will learn from that but he’s waiting the contact, that’s what everybody does now, but he didn’t get any. He was rightly booked for that.

The Arsenal legend has also called for improvements from the younger players in the team so as to justify their inclusion ahead of more established players.
