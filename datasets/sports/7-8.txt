Ronaldo avoids fine despite anger at substitution
Cristiano Ronaldo will escape both a fine and any further punishment for his angered reaction following his substitution during Juventus’ Serie A win over Milan on Sunday.

The Portuguese star was switched out 10 minutes into the second half following a subdued performance with the scores locked at 0-0, to be replaced by Paulo Dybala.

The latter netted the only goal of the match with just under a quarter-hour to go, to ensure that Maurizio Sarri’s side remain perched at the top of the table, a point ahead of nearest rivals Inter.

However, Ronaldo’s reaction indicated a strong displeasure after he was taken from the field, with reports suggesting that the 34-year-old did not even remain for the rest of the match after he headed down the tunnel.

The forward has since taken to social media to break his silence, with a simple picture on Instagram captioned, “Difficult game, important victory.”

The Bianconeri have now confirmed that they will take no action against Ronaldo for his response to being pulled by Sarri.

The former Chelsea boss refused to be critical of his striker’s conduct, instead opting to highlight that he put his hand up to play despite continuing to struggle with a knee injury.

“He should be thanked because he made himself available despite not being in optimal conditions,” the Italian stated in his post-match press briefing.

“In the last month he has had this discomfort in his knee and this is a little problem for him.”

Ronaldo now turns his attention to international duty with Portugal, where he will be expected to skipper his nation against Lithuania and Luxembourg in their final Euro 2020 qualifiers.
