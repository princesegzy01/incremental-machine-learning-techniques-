Youngsters at Saints Football Academy Lagos will get a chance to train at Southampton after the two clubs signed an academy agreement in Lagos on Friday.

The two-year partnership deal will see the English Premier League club become the club’s first International Academy affiliate club partner.

The Saints Football Academy is open to aspiring players from age six to 14.

Project coordinator Anthony Asikwe said at a press conference on Friday that their mission was centered on discovering the plethora of talents in Nigeria.

“No football talent spotted will go to waste, they will be trained and nurtured,” Asikwe told SUNDAY PUNCH.

“We have naturally gifted players and we hope to ensure that we discover the next big star that will grace the world stage, we will spare no effort that we are at the heart of football development.”

Southampton’s Global Development Manager, Mathew Sanger, said, “One of the reasons why we are partnering Saints Football Academy Lagos is their enthusiasm and their professional way of trying to achieve the same goal.

“We want to develop youth all round from education and football. We’ve seen talents in the past, old and young, we will be sharing our academy performance plan and collaborate with Saints Lagos to deliver a master plan to grow the youths in Nigeria. We will share our entire academic plan to help nurture the next big star in Nigeria.”
