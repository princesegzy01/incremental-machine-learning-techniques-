Overhead goal against Juve my best– Ronaldo
Cristiano Ronaldo says his overhead kick for Real Madrid against Juventus is the favourite of his 701 career goals.

The Portuguese star reached the historic 700-goal milestone while playing for his country earlier in October, a simple penalty in a defeat to Ukraine.

The 700th goal came in his 973rd game, of which he scored at least once in 458 of them, over 17 years.

Ronaldo has spent the majority of his career at Real Madrid so it is of no surprise that his favourite strike came for Los Blancos, and after a few attempts.

“Seven hundred goals, it’s an impressive total that makes me all the more proud that few players have reached,” he told France Football.

“If you ask me to choose [a favourite], I would say the goal against Juventus because it’s a goal I’ve been trying to score for years.”
