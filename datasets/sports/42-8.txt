Ahead of Super Eagles 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying games against Benin Republic and Lesotho, Victor Osimhen has allayed fears of any prolonged injury worries.

Osimhen was substituted in 58th minute of Lille’s 3-0 win over Bordeaux after a tackle by defender Laurent Koscielny.

After the game, Lille manager Christophe Galtier, confirmed the forward suffered a minor injury.

“Osimhen has a pain in the abductor, it can be a nuisance,” Galtier told the club’s website.

Osimhen however took to Instagram on Sunday to reveal the injury was not a serious one.

He made this known when he replied a question from fellow international Kenneth Omeruo over his state of health. Omeruo wrote, “Hope you are okay, brother?”

“I am fine, it’s just a minor issue, thanks brother,” Osimhen replied.

The Eagles will play Benin on November 14 at home in their opening 2021 AFCON qualifying game, before traveling to Lesotho to battle the South Africans on November 19.

The forward has been in fine form this season with eight goals this season for Lille.

He also scored for the Eagles in the 2-2 draw against Ukraine in an international friendly last month.
