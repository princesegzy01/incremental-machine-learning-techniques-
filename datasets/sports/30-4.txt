Rogers: Iheanacho will grab his chance
Ebenezer Bajela

Leicester City manager, Brendan Rogers, has reiterated that Nigeria forward, Kelechi Iheancho, is going nowhere and he is certain that the Nigeria international will be ready whenever he needs him.

Iheancho has found playing time hard to come by since his big money move from Manchester City in 2017, but his club coach in his press conference on Friday ahead of their away game to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday said that it is unfortunate that he has to compete with Vardy but he is confident that the Nigerian’ll seize his chances when it come.

“He’s playing behind one of the great strikers in Europe. I know that when I need him, he’ll be ready,” Rogers said.

Iheanacho was in action for the Foxes in their 3-1 win against Burton Albion in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, scoring the opening goal in the 7th minute.

His only other appearance was also in the Carabao Cup Third Round win against Luton Town where he scored Leicester City’s last goal in the 4-0 win.

The arrival of Ayoze Perez from Newcatle United has further limited his chances of playing on a regular basis.
