The Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, has hailed the Special Eagles for reaching the final at the just-concluded Amputee Football African Cup of Nations.

The minister’s congratulatory remarks were contained in a tweet on Sunday.

The Special Eagles won silver after bowing 2-0 to Angola, who hosted the competition, in their final game played on Friday.

The Special Eagles resurfaced in the continental tournament after six years of non-participation due to lack of funds and sponsorship.

Commending the team for their display, Dare tweeted, “This blessed morning (Sunday) let me celebrate the Nigeria Special Eagles who won silver in the Amputee Africa Nations Cup hosted by Angola. I congratulate them and Nigeria is proud of them. There is indeed ability in disability.”

Meanwhile, assistant coach of the Nigeria Amputee Football Federation, Gbenga Dosumu, urged the sports ministry to reward the players.

The coach added, “We have, in the midst of poor funding, performed well and without mincing words, our achievement deserves a good reward from the sports ministry. We should be celebrated because it is not easy.

“As a team, we made sacrifices to represent Nigeria and with passion and commitment, we were able to mount the podium for the silver trophy. Today, we are number two on the continent.”

Kelvin Kingsley netted four goals, and emerged as Nigeria’s highest goal scorer, while Ezeji Kennedy scored three goals.
