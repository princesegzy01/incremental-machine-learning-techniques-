South Africa’s coach, David Notoane, and his Zambia counterpart, Beston Chambeshi, have hailed the first female referee to officiate a game in the history of U-23 AFCON, Salma Mukansanga.

Rwandan match official Mukansanga was at the helm of the Group B match between South Africa and Zambia on Saturday at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo.

She was joined by a female assistant referee, Fatiha Jermoumi from Morocco, and male match officials Dick Okello from Uganda and Gabonese Pierre Atcho.

It was the second time in CAF history that a female referee leads a men’s match after the 2019 U-17 AFCON.

Commenting on the performance of the female referee, Notoane said, “The referee is a qualified one and I think she did a great job.

“I believe this is a fantastic decision from CAF and we have to promote and support such initiative.”

“Having a female referee is a good initiative and it needs all our support. Today’s referee had a good game and this is good for football,” Chambeshi added.

Following the match, CAF President Ahmad Ahmad, also hailed the female referee on her performance.

He said, “We saw great team work among our match officials and I congratulate all four of you on your strong performance on the pitch. Keep up the good work!”
