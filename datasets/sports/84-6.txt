Top seed Mansouri powers into q’finals
Tournament top seed, Skander Mansouri, had to dig deep to fend off a spirited challenge from Nigeria’s Emmanuel Idoko and reach the quarter-finals of the Lagos Open on Thursday.

Mansouri, seeking his fifth ITF Tour title this year, claimed a hard-fought 7-5, 6-4 victory to set up a quarter-final showdown with 7th seed, Takanyi Garanganga of Zimbabwe.

Idoko, who had beaten Kenya’s Kibet Yego in straights in the first round on Wednesday, drew first blood, as he broke Mansouri in the opening game and quickly edged in front for a 3-1 lead.

However, the Tunisian fought back, getting a crucial break in the 8th game for 4-4. But Idoko would falter while serving to take the set to a tiebreak and the top seed took advantage, breaking the Nigerian to clinch the set.

Mansouri, opened a 5-2 lead in the second set and despite Idoko’s best attempt to find a way back,, the Tunisian held firm to secure victory, winning the set 6-4.

Elsewhere, 2015 champion, Aldin Setkic stayed on track for a 28th ITF Tour title, following a quick 6-3, 6-1 victory over Indian qualifier, Yash Chaurasia. The encounter lasted just under 90 minutes.

The 31-year-old Bosnian will next take on No. 2 seed, Aziz Dougaz of Tunisia, who came from behind to claim a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over France’s Thomas Setodji in one hour, 59 minutes.
