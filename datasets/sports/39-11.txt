Nigeria will face Ecuador on Tuesday (today) at the ongoing U-17 World Cup at the Estádio Olímpico, Goiânia with the winner of the match qualifying for the Round of 16 of the competition.

The Golden Eaglets came from behind twice to defeat Hungary in their opening game on Saturday while Ecuador also picked up maximum points beating Australia 2-1 in their opening Group B game.

Five-time champions Nigeria, who failed to qualify for the last edition of the competition in India in 2017, last failed to make it out of the group stage of the U-17 tournament at the 2003 edition in Finland, where they finished third recording just one win.

Looking ahead of the game, La Tri captain, Joan Lopez, says the team is prepared for whatever comes their way in the tournament.

“We have all been working together within the national team for a year now in this cycle,” Lopez said. “We all have an excellent understanding each other and are prepared for whatever comes our way,” he told FIFA.com. The game comes up 9pm.
