‘Pillars to receive N25m AITEO Cup money soon’
Solape Lawal-Solarin

Just after Sports Extra reported the non-release of the AITEO Cup’s ultimate prize money to champions, Kano Pillars, two months after defeating Niger Tornadoes via penalties in Kaduna, it seems better days are ahead for Sai Masu Gida.

The AITEO Cup champions have received positive reports surrounding the non-payment of their N25m prize money for emerging winners, according to the club’s media manager, Idris Malikawa.

Malikawa said the Nigeria Football Federation will release the money to the club “in a matter of days.”

“From the information reaching the club from the federation, we’ll get the money soon,” he stated.

On why it took so long for the club to get clarity over the funds, Malikawa added, “The delay in payment of the prize money was not intentional, we were made to know that circumstances beyond the federation’s control caused it.

“Based on this development, we’re commending the AITEO Group for sponsoring the competition and hope they’ll not relent in their efforts in moving the game forward in the country.”
