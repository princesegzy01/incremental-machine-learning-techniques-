Nigerian hurdler Oluwatobiloba Amusan and long jumper Ese Brume will reignite Nigeria’s medal hopes on Day 10 of the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, after failing to pick a medal after nine days of events.

Amusan remains one of Nigeria’s biggest medal hopefuls and was fastest in the 100m hurdles heats in 12.48secs. She and leads the field of 24 qualifiers into Sunday’s semi-finals.

The 22-year-old’s time of 12.48secs is her personal and season’s best time and she will be hoping to better the time heading into the final, with an extra incentive after Olympic champion Brianna McNeal was disqualified for a false start.

In the long jump event, Brume needed just one jump to qualify for the final in Doha.

The 2014 Commonwealth Games champion needed a jump of 6.75m to qualify for the final, but produced a superb first time jump of 6.89m to automatically qualify for the final as the second best jumper on Saturday behind Germany’s Malaika Mihambo.

Nigeria failed to pick a medal on Day 9 of the event after shot put athlete, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, finished eighth in the men’s event with a throw of 21.18m.

The result is an improvement from the 2017 edition in London, where he failed to reach the final of the event.

United States’ Joe Kovacs rolled back the years, throwing a massive new record of 22.91m to win the gold, while Ryan Crouser produced a last round throw of 22.90m, beating Tomas Walsh on count back to place second and third respectively.

Nigeria last won a World Championships medal at the 2013 edition in Moscow, with Blessing Okagbare winning a silver medal in the long jump and a bronze in the women’s 200M events.
