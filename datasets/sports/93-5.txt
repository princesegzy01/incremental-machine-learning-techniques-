Chairperson Nigeria Women’s Football League, Aisha Falode, has charged the Super Falcons to beat Ivory Coast in their Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games qualifier second leg tie scheduled for the Agege Stadium, Lagos on Monday (today).

The Super Falcons forced Les Femelles Elephantes to a 0-0 draw in the first leg at the Parc des Sports de Treichville on Thursday.

A win for the African champions will move them close to a ticket to the Olympics, which they last qualified for in 2008 in Beijing, China.

Falode said, “Our last Olympic appearance was in Beijing in 2008. This is a perfect time for us to return to Asia in 2020. The match on Monday is a must win if we are to make progress in the quest for Tokyo 2020.”

She urged the Falcons to keep their unbeaten record intact against their West African rivals.

“Agege stadium is our home. The Falcons have never lost a match at the Soccer Temple but history is not result. Show the character of true champions and give the Nigerian people and the teeming football-loving Lagosians the victory against the Ivorians,” she added.

Meanwhile, Arna-Bjornar’s Ngozi Ebere earned a late invitation to the Nigeria women’s side for Monday’s clash against Cote d’Ivoire.

She joined the team in their training session on Sunday.
