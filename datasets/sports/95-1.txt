Dare charges Eaglets to win sixth world title
Kelvin Ekerete

Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, has charged Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets to win their sixth U-17 World Cup in Brazil.

The cadet tournament is billed to take place in Brazil between October 26 and November 17, with the five-time champions placed in Group B alongside Hungary, Ecuador and Australia.

The Nigerians play their first match at the Estádio Olímpico, in Goiânia, against Hungary on October 26.

Dare paid a courtesy visit to the training camp of the team on Saturday in Abuja, and tasked them to do the nation proud by returning with the trophy.

“The target for the team is to win the cup again for the sixth time. I told them the only option is victory and for them to be able to win it for a sixth time alone sets them apart and also sets the country apart as a solid football playing nation.

“I think the lesson here for us is that the strength of our football is in grassroots development.”

With the team set to depart the country on Wednesday, Dare promised the players and the crew adequate government backing.

“I have listened to some of their requests, the ministry will work with the federation to make sure that their needs are met before they leave on Wednesday.”
