Brazil vs Senegal: The Lions of Teranga hold Seleção to 1-1 draw
Brazil on Thursday settled for a 1-1 draw in a friendly with Senegal in Singapore.

Roberto Firmino opened the scoring for the Copa America champions with a stunning lob after a Coutinho lay-off in the eighth minute.

As the half progressed, the livelier Senegal became, driven on by their captain Cheikhou Kouyate.

Famara Diedhiou levelled from the penalty spot just before half-time after Sadio Mane was dragged down in the area.

Neymar, who was not in the side that won the Copa America in June, had a relatively quiet game but went close with a 67th minute free-kick.

He then teed up Richarlison whose shot from the edge of the box flashed wide.

Ismaila Sarr and Mane both had chances to snatch the game for the Lions of Teranga.
