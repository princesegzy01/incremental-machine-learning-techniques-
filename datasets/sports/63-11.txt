Bursaspor defender, Shehu Abdullahi, is delighted at the Green Crocodiles’ hard-fought 2-1 win over Umraniyespor at the Timsah Arena.

The Bursa city outfit, who currently occupy seventh in the Turkish First League, are hoping to make an immediate return to the topflight after suffering relegation last season.

And the 23-year-old expressed his delight on his Instagram handle.

“Tough home win against Umraniyespor, superb last 10 minutes of the game and never gave up team spirit.

“Dear Bursaspor fans, this moment is important, don’t give up. Let’s fight together and conquer.

“The management needs all your support,” he wrote on his Instagram handle.

The Super Eagles defender has played seven league games this season, bagging a goal for the club.
