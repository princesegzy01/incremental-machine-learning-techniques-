F1 star Hamilton considers Hollywood career
Lewis Hamilton‘s Formula One commitments mean he has missed out on a role in the new Top Gun: Maverick film.

However, the British driver does want to break into the film industry and has hired an agent and sent out audition tapes in a bid to help his ambitions.

Hamilton has had cameos in the Disney franchise Cars and Zoolander 2 but his role in Top Gun would have been much more prominent.

As a result, the Mercedes driver was simply unable to spare the time needed to film his scenes.

Speaking to ESPN, Hamilton said, “I was trying to get in Top Gun because I’m a massive fan of Top Gun, but I didn’t have time to do any filming.

“But I had an opportunity to do it and I couldn’t do it.”

Most recently, Hamilton was an executive producer on Netflix documentary The Game Changers .

“I do want to do [acting],” he added. “I auditioned for a movie a while ago and it took one day to learn the role.

“I had a fashion show in Paris, and I probably had maybe four or five shows to go to, so in between I quickly changed and saw this [acting] coach, and I saw her for 20 minutes and we quickly went through one part and then I went to a show and came back and went through another part. By the end of the day I had to record a video to send it to Los Angeles — it was so cool!

“But I didn’t get the part — it was a big part! There was no way I was going to get this part, I think. Someone like Kurt Russell got it — well, not Kurt Russell, but someone who works alongside him. I knew I wasn’t going to get it!”

Only Eden Hazard has been in Zidane’s starting 11 consistently, with fellow summer signings Luka Jovic, Eder Militao, Ferland Mendy and Rodrygo struggling for game time.

This is why Perez is hoping to make a Galactico signing in the form of Mbappe by splashing a huge amount of money on one player.
