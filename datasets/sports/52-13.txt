Arsenal, United continue Europa battles on StarTimes
English giants Manchester United and Arsenal continue their quests for continental glory on Thursday (today) when they return to the Europa League at the Emirate and Partizan Stadium respectively.

Both matches will be aired live on StarTimes, the pay-TV company stated.

Arsenal host Victoria SC at the Emirates, while Manchester United travel to Serbia for their tie against Partizan Belgrade.

Both matches will be broadcast in Nigeria by StarTimes on its Channels 254 and 245

Arsenal Coach, Unai Emery is likely to send out a much changed team for today’s game, much as he has in their previous matches with Standard Liege and Eintracht Frankfurt.

Top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is likely to be rested while Alexandre Lacazette was fit enough to come on as a substitute against Sheffield United, young Brazilian striker Gabriel Martinelli is expected to lead the line after nabbing four goals in his first two starts for Arsenal.

The Gunners have won both of their opening fixtures in this year’s group stage while fielding a side packed with youth products, scoring seven goals and keeping two clean sheets in the process.

United won their opening Europa League tie 1-0 against FC Astana at Old Trafford, before playing out a turgid 0-0 draw away to AZ Alkmaar, meaning Solskjaer’s side have yet to concede in Europe this season
