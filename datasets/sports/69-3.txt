Messy fight! Rooney, Vardy’s wives brace for legal battle
Coleen Rooney’s pals say she’s poised for a legal battle against Rebekah Vardy and that she has “bulletproof evidence” to prove she’s right.

The WAGs have been embroiled in a furious row after Coleen accused Rebekah of leaking stories about her to the press.

After suspecting Jamie Vardy’s wife, Coleen, who is married to Wayne Rooney, says she leaked a series of fake stories that only Rebekah’s account could see on Instagram to test whether or not they’d make it to the press.

And when they did, she revealed her detective work – that saw her nicknamed Wagatha Christie – in an epic statement that went viral on social media.

After pregnant Rebekah was pictured in tears as she landed back in the UK after cutting her Dubai holiday short, people in Coleen’s circle say she’s poised for a showdown.

A friend of the star told the Mail on Sunday, “Coleen’s view is, ‘Bring it on’. She has got the evidence – it’s all there.

“Coleen’s evidence is bulletproof and she stands by it all. If Rebekah wants to sue, she’s welcome to.

“Coleen will fight her and the proof is there. If it’s in court, it’s not ideal but Coleen will follow it through.”

Last night, Rebekah, who said she was “disgusted” she even had to deny leaking the stories, was seen looking distraught as she arrived back in the UK.
