Former Senator representing Kaduna South Senatorial District, Shehu Sanni, has said ex-players needed to be paid for their services to the country to make sports more attractive.

He lamented that Mudashiru Lawal, Rashidi Yekini and Samuel Okwaraji, among others, were abandoned after serving the nation well.

He said this at a memorial lecture organised in honour of late Best Ogedegbe, goalkeeper when Green Eagles won the African Cup of Nations for the first time in 1980.

The legendary goalkeeper died on September 28, 2009 at the age of 55, after an eye surgery.

Sanni said, “The sports sector needs funding from government and the private sector. You can’t be preparing for Olympics when it is simply two to three months to Olympics. You will get nothing.

“We have seen great men who served this country like Lawal, Yekini, Okwaraji, Aloysius Atuegbu. Many of these people who worked tirelessly to bring glory to our country, but at the last phase of their lives abandoned.

“Right now, we also have many who have played for Green Eagles and Super Eagles who have brought joy to our country and are suffering. Unfortunately, nothing is done about them.”
