All four Nigerians players in the second round of the Lagos Open Tennis Championships were on Thursday knocked out from the competition.

Nigeria’s teenage sensation, Oyinlomo Quadre, lost to Indian fifth seed, Riya Bhatia, 6-2, 2-6, 2-6 in the second game of the day.

Quadre, who was dominant beating Patience Onebamhoin 6-0, 6-2 in the first round, took the first 6-2.

She was however not able to keep up the tempo, losing the second and third sets.

Nigeria’s No. 2 men’s player, Joseph Imeh, retired early in his second round tie against Zimbabwe’s Takanyi Garanganga.

Imeh was forced to retire with a knee injury after going down 3-0 in the first set.

Blessing Samuel lost in straight sets to No. 2 seed, Sandra Samir. The Egyptian needed just 48 minutes to send Samuel packing with a 6-0, 6-0 win.

Tournament top seed, Skander Mansouri, had to dig deep to fend off a spirited challenge from Nigeria’s Emmanuel Idoko and reach the quarter-finals of the Lagos Open on Thursday.

Mansouri, seeking his fifth ITF Tour title this year, claimed a hard-fought 7-5, 6-4 victory to set up a quarter-final showdown with 7th seed, Takanyi Garanganga of Zimbabwe.
