Super Eagles forward, Samuel Chukwueze, has expressed his desire to ply his trade in the English Premier League.

Chukwueze, who plays for La Liga side, Villarreal, however said his move to the EPL will be based on assurances of first team football.

“My ambition is to play in the Premier League, but I want to go to a club where I’m really wanted, where I will be a starting player. Both the coach and club owner must show desire to sign me,” he told Fast Track.

The forward has reportedly been on the radar of EPL leaders, Liverpool, with coach Jurgen Klopp desperate to add him to his attack.

According to Don Balon, Klopp is a big admirer of Chukwueze, who he thinks could be the next Sadio Mane at Anfield.

Megoalsport reported in October that Liverpool are ready to make a January move for the 20-year-old.

Villarreal have already increased Chukwueze’s release clause, to scare away potential buyers.

According to Spanish media outlet AS, the Yellow Submarines tied him down to a €100m release clause.

Reports say the €100m release clause will be in place for the next two years, before dropping to €80m in the third year, which would allow the player to move for less and reward his loyalty.

Chukwueze has been in good form for Villarreal this season, scoring two goals and creating two assists in 12 appearances.

He was included the 50-man shortlist for the 2019 Golden Boy Awards, before missing out in the 20-man list released last month.

He was however nominated in the 10 players for the 2019 Kopa Trophy award, organised by France Football.”
