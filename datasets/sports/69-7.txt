Playing against Brazil was indescribable –Okoye

Super Eagles goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye, says it was an overwhelming experience after featuring for Nigeria in a 1-1 friendly draw against five-time World Cup champions Brazil in Singapore.

Okoye replaced injured Francis Uzoho in the 63rd minute putting up a standout performance to keep the Brazilians from scoring for the rest of the game.

The Fortuna Düsseldorf II shot stopper noted that the feeling of making his first national team cap was indescribable.

“It was a great feeling, almost indescribable. There were so many emotions going through my mind but now I just have to thank God for the opportunity I got to play for my beloved country.”

The 20-year-old who had a chat with Selecao goalkeeper Ederson after the game says it was unreal playing on the same pitch alongside players he looks up to.

“I talked to Ederson (after the game) and he is one of my favourite goalkeepers right now. It was crazy playing on the same pitch as the goalkeepers you watch their videos on Youtube to learn how to get better and you’re playing on the same pitch, it is crazy,” he said.

With first choice goalkeeper, Uzoho, out injured for at least six months, Okoye, will be hoping to assert himself as the country’s safe hands ahead of Heartland goalkeeper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa.
