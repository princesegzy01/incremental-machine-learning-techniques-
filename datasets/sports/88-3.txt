I never wanted to play for Nigeria – Abraham
Tammy Abraham is looking to fully commit to England, with the Chelsea striker eager to become a regular in the Three Lions fold and bring a debate regarding his international allegiance to a close.

Abraham insists the Nigeria question has not been raised during his time in the England camp, saying he never wanted to play for another country except England.

“I’m a player growing up in England, playing in the Premier League. My ambitions were always to play for England. Obviously it’s nice to be wanted by two nations, two nations that I love. But my main focus is England,” he said.

Abraham told the Evening Standard, “Back then in 2017, it was all about me being young.

“It was a good experience, for me. So, to be going back now, I had my experiences out on loan, I’m back and now it’s time to stay here.”

“For me, it’s a massive achievement [to be in the squad]. I’m clearly doing something right for my club to get attention from Gareth Southgate. It’s about going out there, helping the team as much as possible. And then coming back in and doing the same job for my team.”

As things stand, the 22-year-old is still eligible to represent Nigeria, however, he will end the uncertainty surrounding his international future if a competitive outing for England is taken in during their upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.

Abraham already has two senior caps to his name, but they were collected during friendly outings against Germany and Spain in November 2017.

His form at Chelsea has brought him back into the reckoning and a man who has worked hard to reach this point, taking in a number of loan spells along the way, is determined to become a mainstay in Gareth Southgate’s plans.
