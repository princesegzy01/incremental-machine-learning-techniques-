Mikel Obi will miss Trabzonspor’s Europa League clash against Russian club, Krasnodar on Thursday, his coach has revealed.

But his compatriot, Anthony Nwakaeme is expected to feature in the encounter.

Mikel has missed Trabzonspor’s last three league games against Gaziantep FK, Istanbul Basaksehir and Goztepe on account of a thigh injury.

“Mikel is out of the trip to Russia just as Abdulkadir Parmak,” Karaman told Fanatik.

“They are still undergoing treatment and we won’t be risking them.

“But he is in training for the game against Alanyaspor at the weekend.

Trabzonspor are bottom of Group C with one point from three games.
