My girls keep me going – Mikel
Kelvin Ekerete

Former Super Eagles captain, Mikel Obi, has attributed his recent fine performances for Turkish side Trabzonspor to his twin daughters.

Mikel played the entire duration of Sunday’s 2-1 at Rizespor, a result that moved them to third on the league table after seven games with three wins, three draws and a loss. They climbed past Konyaspor, who are also on 12 points, after seven games on superior goals difference.

The former Chelsea man was cautioned in the sixth minute of the encounter.

The home side opened scoring in the 23rd minute through Dario Melnak, while Alexander Sorloth equalised for the visitors in the 73rd minute, but a 90th minute goal from Anthony Nwakaeme ensured the visitors departed the Yeni Rize Şehir Stadium with maximum points.

Reacting to the win, Mikel, on his Instagram handle expressed happiness with the result, adding that his daughters kept him going.

“Great win, massive three points, my angels keep me going,” he wrote on Instagram with a picture of his daughters.

Mikel is yet to score or make an assist for Trabzonspor in 11 appearances in all competitions.
