Messi lauds Van Dijk as ultimate defender
Lionel Messi has faced plenty of talented defenders during his time at Barcelona, but Liverpool centre-half Virgil van Dijk has earned special praise from the five-time Ballon d’Or winner as they prepare to do battle for the 2019 award.

The Barcelona superstar suffered an agonising Champions League exit at the hands of Liverpool last season, with a Dutch centre-half catching his eye

The Netherlands international crossed paths with a mercurial Argentine forward at the semi-final stage of last season’s Champions League.

It appeared as though Messi would have the last laugh in that battle as he netted a stunning free-kick as part of a 3-0 first leg triumph for Barca – his 600th goal for the Blaugrana.

A remarkable contest was, however, to be turned on its head at Anfield, with Liverpool surging to a 4-0 victory on home soil and a place in the final – which they would go on to win.

Van Dijk played an important part in keeping Messi and Co. quiet on Merseyside, with an all-time great acknowledging that the £75m man is the ultimate performer in his chosen position.

Messi told Marca of Van Dijk, “He is a defender who knows how to judge his timing and wait for the right moment to challenge or jockey (the attacker).

“He is very fast and big, but he has a lot of agility for his height.

“He is fast because of his great stride, and he is impressive both in defence and attack because he scores lots of goals.”
