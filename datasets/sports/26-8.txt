Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, recently released his 23-man squad for the 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho, with Slavia Prague striker, Peter Olayinka, placed on standby alongside Brighton’s Leon Balogun and Stoke’s Oghenekaro Etebo.

The 23-year-old made his debut for Nigeria against Brazil in an international friendly on October 13 following eye-catching performances for his club in the league and in Europe.

But ahead of the AFCON qualifying showdown against the Squirrels of Benin and Likuena of Lesotho, the Prague striker struggled to find a place in Rohr’s final 23-man list, hence, had to settle for a spot on the standby list.

It is a situation that doesn’t worry his agent, Olusegun Odusanya, who revealed to Sports Extra that the player will be happy to seize his chance when it comes.

“He is not bothered. We spoke about it, he understands quite well that the team is competitive but, he is happy to get a standby order from the coach.

“He told me he is focused and will keep on working so that when the opportunity comes he’ll seize it,” he stated.

Olayinka has made 17 appearances in all competitions, scoring six goals and grabbing two assists for the league leaders so far this season.
