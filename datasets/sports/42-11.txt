Enyimba FC started their CAF Confederations Cup campaign on Sunday with a 2-0 win over visiting South African side TS Galaxy at the Enyimba Stadium, Aba.

The Nigerian club side set an early marker, scoring in the seventh minute through Victor Mbaoma.

Mbaoma scored his debut goal for Enyimba after a cross from Abdulrahman Bashir.

The Aba-based side failed to add to their lead, ending the first half 1-0 up.

On the hour mark, Martins Usule doubled the lead for the home side with a powerful header.

Enyimba had goalkeeper Theophilus Afelokhai to thank for good saves, which kept his side in the game.

The return leg is billed for next week in South Africa with the winner qualifying for the group stage of the Confederation Cup.

The other Nigerian side in the competition, Enugu Rangers, fell to an injury time goal to lose 2-1 away to Togolose side Kara.

Rangers will host Kara in the second leg on November 3.
