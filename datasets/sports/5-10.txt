Locomotiv Plovdiv defender, Stephen Eze, says they are ready to fight to overtake leaders Ludogrets at the top of the league table.

Ludogorets welcome second-placed Plovdiv to the Stadium Ludogorets Arena, in a top of the league clash on Saturday, with Eze stating that they are ready for the challenge.

Plovdiv have won 11 out of 16 games this season, but are six points behind the leaders.

Reacting to his team’s 2-0 win over 13th placed Botev Vrasta, the giant defender says they have enough motivation to face the defending champions.

“Another victory in the bag with 2-0 against Botev Vratsa, we continue our domination on the table with just six points behind the leaders Ludogorets! Lot more to come and we are ready for the challenge,” he wrote on Instagram.
