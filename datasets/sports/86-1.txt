Mourinho wants Spurs job if…
Jose Mourinho reportedly has his eyes on the Tottenham job if Mauricio Pochettino leaves.

The Portuguese has been out of work since being sacked by Manchester United last December and says that he is waiting for the right opportunity to come along.

He continues to be linked with a return to former club Real Madrid amid speculation over the future of Zinedine Zidane.

Mourinho is thought to be biding his time but Spurs are also believed to appeal to the former Chelsea, Inter Milan, and Porto boss.

This could all lead to a managerial merry-go-round with Pochettino also being linked with Real Madrid in recent times.

Spurs are going through a very tricky patch at the start of the season and there are rumours that the players are not fully committed to the cause.

A 3-0 loss to Brighton on Saturday only intensified speculation over Pochettino’s future just days after he watched on as his team were thrashed 7-2 at home to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.

Mourinho, 56, has been working as a pundit on Sky Sports since he lost his job at Old Trafford and says he has already declined offers at former club Benfica and a £90m proposal from Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande.
