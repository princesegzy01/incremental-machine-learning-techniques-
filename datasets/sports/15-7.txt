Daniel Akpeyi kept his fourth successive clean sheet of the season in the Absa Premiership clash for Kaizer Chiefs, who defeated relegation-threatened Chippa United 2-0 at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Wednesday, Sports Extra reports.

The win stretched the Amakhosi’s lead at the top of the log to seven points ahead of second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns who have a game in hand.

Kaizer Chiefs have 25 points from 10 games while Sundowns have 18 points from nine games.

The 33-year-old had previously kept clean sheets against Black Leopards, Baroka FC, Golden Arrows and Mamelodi Sundowns so far this season in the PSL.

The game was Akpeyi’s 16th since he arrived from Chippa United and he has conceded 13 goals.

In Saudi Arabia, Super Eagles captain , Ahmed Musa, made his second substitute appearance for Al Nassr, who defeated Al Faisaly 2-0 in a league clash.

Musa replaced Nodin Amrabat in the 87th minute of the encounter. The 26-year-old skipper is yet to score in four league games this season.

Bryan Idowu was an unused substitute for Lokomotiv Moscow, who lost 2-1 at home to Juventus in Wednesday’s UEFA Champions League clash in Moscow.
