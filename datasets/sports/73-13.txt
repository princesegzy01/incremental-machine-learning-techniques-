Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has hinted that goalkeeper Francis Uzoho’s injury may affect the team as they prepare for their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying games.

Uzoho sustained an injury after twisting his leg in the international friendly against Brazil in Singapore on Sunday.

Uzoho will be out for a minimum of six months, according to Super Eagles doctor, Ibrahim Gyaran.

Uzoho’s injury came after the coach asserted that the goalkeeping crisis in the team was over with his recent form.

Rohr, however, commended the Nigerian players for an outstanding performance, describing the result as a confidence booster.

“This result is a good confidence boost for the team. We now have to prepare for the more competitive games next month.

“I am happy we stayed organised even when the Brazilians mounted a lot of pressure on us in the second half. The only negative thing is the injury to (Francis) Uzoho,” the Franco-German said, minutes after the final whistle at the Singapore National Stadium in Kallang.

Meanwhile, the NFF in a statement on Tuesday confirmed that Nigeria would be playing their first leg of the 2021 AFCON qualifiers on Novermber 14.

“Nigeria host Benin Republic on November 14 on the opening day of the 2021 AFCON qualifying campaign, before flying to Lesotho for a Day Two match on November 19,” the statement added.
