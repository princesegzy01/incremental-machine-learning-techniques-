Court hears Ferguson, Conte allegations
Agent Giuseppe ‘Pino’ Pagliara is on trial in England for bribery, having told an undercover reporter he helped Sir Alex Ferguson ‘fix’ a Manchester United match with Juventus and gave then-Chelsea manager Antonio Conte back-handers.

This is the same trial and general undercover sting operation from the Daily Telegraph that forced England manager Sam Allardyce to resign.

Pagliara, fellow agent Dax Price and former Barnsley assistant coach Tommy Wright are on trial at Southwark Crown Court for bribery.

Prosecutor Brian O’Neill QC said in court today that Pagliara accused Ferguson of conspiring to fix a Champions League game between Manchester United and Juventus.

“Towards the end of the meeting Pagliara launched into what could only be described as a diatribe of Sir Ferguson, accusing him of having conspired with Pagliara to fix the result of a football match between Juventus, a club which Pagliara was associated with, and Manchester United in the Champions League for which Pagliara had thanked him with a gold 30 grand Rolex watch.”
