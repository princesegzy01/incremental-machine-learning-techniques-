British tabloid rates Iwobi ahead of Sigurdsson

Nigeria forward, Alex Iwobi, has been placed ahead of Everton teammate, Gylfi Sigurdsson, in the race for the number 10 role, according to British tabloid, Liverpoolecho.

Marco Silva has been forced to experiment with his starting line-up in an attempt to create a winning formula that can steer them towards the top half of the Premier League table with Iwobi moved into the no.10 role.

Silva remains undecided on who to use as his play-maker between the Nigerian and the Icelandic as the team continue to struggle.

The British tabloid however said that Iwobi is ahead of his teammate in the pecking order for the play-maker role.

“Sigurdsson produces match-winning moments – such as his stunning strike off the bench late on vs West Ham – his all-round tendency to drift through a game unnoticed often outweighs those fleeting contributions.

“He does little to move the ball into dangerous areas on a regular basis and lacks the dynamism to threaten a defence through quick feet or dribbling ability.

“Iwobi, on the other hand, seems to possess more of an imposing and dynamic spark from the middle. But from looking at his underlying numbers from that no.10 role, has he done enough to solidify himself as a starter for the forseeable future?

“For comparison, Iwobi, who has played 361 minutes so far as a no.10, has averaged 24.5 passes per 90 minutes. This would indicate that the Nigerian international tends to find more pockets of space to receive the ball from team-mates.”
