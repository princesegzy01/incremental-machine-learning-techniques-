West Ham’s first-team goalkeeping coach, Xavi Valero, has tipped their academy starlet, Daniel Jinadu, to win the race for the starting spot for Nigeria at the FIFA U-17 World Cup finals in Brazil when it kicks-off on Saturday 26 October.

Jinadu, faces stiff competition from Bournemouth’s Joseph Oluwabusola and Football College Abuja’s Sunday Stephen.

Speaking on the club’s website, Valero said he is confident that Daniel has the chance to be in goal for the Eaglets.

‘’Krisztian is the regular No1 for Hungary, and Daniel has been selected as one of three goalkeepers for Nigeria,’’ Valero said to West Ham’s official website.

‘’I think Daniel has a chance to start for Nigeria, especially in the first game of the group against Hungary.

‘’That will be the Krisztian Hegyi vs Daniel Jinadu game and if that happens, it’ll be great news for the Academy and for the Club.’’

Should Jinadu start against the Hungarians, he could face his West Ham teammate, Krisztian Hegyi.
