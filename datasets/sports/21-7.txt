The Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, has promised to assist the Nigeria Women’s Football League to gain sponsorship for the Nigeria Women’s Premier League.

He said this while addressing journalists after the 2018/19 season NWPL Super 4 final won by Rivers Angels after a 1-0 triumph over Confluence Queens on Sunday.

Dare commended the skills displayed by the women footballers, adding that the sports ministry was dedicated to the development of women’s football in the country.

He said, “I am impressed by what I have seen, we have seen women professional football at its best. We’ve seen the exhibition of talents; we know some of our footballers are headed for the professional league outside of this country.

“All I can say is that the sports ministry would partner with the Nigeria Football Federation and we will also try to see that we get the sponsorship to support them to do better.”

While expressing his delight at the commencement of the men’s professional football league, Dare said, “We will meet with all the key stakeholders before the end of November to start to draw a strategic plan on how to improve the domestic league.

“As I said earlier, it is very critical; it is the engine room of our football development, that’s where we produce our professional players that can go abroad.

“So we are going to pay close attention working with the NFF, the club owners and the referees and coaches to isolate the issues and deal with them.”
