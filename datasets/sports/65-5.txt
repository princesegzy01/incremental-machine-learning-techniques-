Alonso goal helps Chelsea to victory over Newcastle United
A 74th minute strike from Spain wing-back Marcos Alonso earned Chelsea three points in a 1-0 win over a dogged Newcastle United in the 2019/2020 English Premier League on Saturday.

Slovakian goalkeeper Martin Dubravka had kept Newcastle United in the game with a string of saves and got a hand to Alonso’s angled left-foot drive but could not keep it out.

Frank Lampard’s young side enjoyed 71 percent possession and earned 11 corner kicks.

But until Alonso’s goal could not make their superiority tell against a resurgent Newcastle, who defended in numbers and looked dangerous on the counter.

Mason Mount, Christian Pulisic, Tammy Abraham and Willian all tested Dubravka from close range.

At the other end, Miguel Almiron and Allan Saint-Maximin troubled Chelsea with pacy moves in the first half.

But Newcastle United, who beat Manchester United in their last game to move out of the relegation zone, lacked finishing quality.

The result lifted Chelsea into fourth place in the table and left Newcastle United hovering above the relegation places.
