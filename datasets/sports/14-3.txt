Players of newly promoted Nigeria Professional Football League side Delta Force are owed six months’ salaries, our correspondent has learnt.

The players are yet to be paid since helping the team gain promotion to the Nigerian topflight league.

A Delta Force striker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said after their season opening 1-1 draw against Akwa Starlets, “The way things are going on now, players don’t even understand, we just try to come out and play because we are no getting paid.”

Another player added, “We have not been paid for seven months, we are just playing with the hope that one day, they will remember us. We haven’t been paid since last season.”

However, chairman of the club, Emmanuel Chidi-Okonkwo, admitted that the players were being owed but saw no reason why they had to complain about it in the public.

“I don’t want to talk about that. I don’t want to discuss about payment and non-payment. I don’t expect a player to say he is not motivated because he is being owed. I am an ex-player and I played abroad. Whether a player is being owed or not, it should not be a reason for a player who has a career not to perform,” he told The PUNCH.

Chidi-Okonkwo added, “Nobody employs someone and doesn’t want to pay. We are already working on the issue, the government is doing its best and everything depends on them. Although I’m the chairman of the club, I’m also an employee of the government.

“If you are told to exercise patience you have to do that. I want the players to understand that they are playing for their careers.”
