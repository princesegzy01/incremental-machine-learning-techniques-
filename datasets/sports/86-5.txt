Officials of the Super Eagles finally secured their entry visas into Singapore on Wednesday, ahead of Sunday’s friendly between Nigeria and Brazil in Singapore.

The Nigerian delegation for the match had scheduled their trip to Singapore for Tuesday, but had to reschedule their flight after they were not granted visas despite submitting all the required documents.

The officials duly departed Nigeria via the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport aboard Emirates Airline on Wednesday, according to a statement from the NFF.

“Among those who received visas and will join the rest of the group (players and technical staff already on ground in Singapore) on Thursday are Team Administrator, Dayo Enebi Achor; Media Officer, Toyin Ibitoye; Team Doctor, Dr. Ibrahim Gyaran; Physiotherapist, Christopher Nnadozie; and Equipment Manager, Chidi Ngoka,” the statement added.

Meanwhile, no fewer than 15 players, including coach Gernot Rohr have arrived in Fairmont Hotel in Singapore for the friendly.

They are Samuel Chukwueze (Villarreal), Chidozie Awaziem (Leganes), Ramon Azeez (Granada), Joseph Ayodele-Aribo (Glasgow Rangers), Victor Solomon-Otabor (CSKA Sofia), Wilfred Ndidi (Leicester) and Alex Iwobi (Everton).

Others are Emmanuel Dennis (Brugge), Victor Osimhen (Lille), William Troost-Ekong (Udinese), Paul Onuachu (Genk), Shehu Abdullahi (Bursaspor), Moses Simon (Nante), Oghenekaro Etebo (Stoke City) and Maduka Okoye (Dusseldorf).

Before clashing with Eagles on at the Singapore National Stadium in Kallang on Sunday, Brazil would play Senegal on Thursday (tomorrow).
