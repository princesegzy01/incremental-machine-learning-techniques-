Super Eagles midfielder Wilfred Ndidi is delighted at Leicester City away win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.

The Foxes produced an excellent away-day showing to beat Crystal Palace 2-0 and return to third place in the Premier League table.

Caglar Soyuncu headed City in front with his first goal for the club midway through the second period, before a calm finish from Jamie Vardy sealed the points late on.

City have now recorded three straight league wins and have boosted their top-four cushion to six points with the victory at Selhurst Park, a ground at which they have struggled in recent seasons.

The win was his 39th since he made his debut for the club in the EPL.

Ndidi, who played the entire 90 minutes in the game, took to Twitter, to express how happy he was at the win.

“Three points away from home and a clean sheet is so satisfying,” Ndidi who has made 98 EPL appearances for Leicester City wrote.

The Eagles midfielder has been in impressive form for Leicester this season featuring in nine of Leicester City’s 11 games so far.
