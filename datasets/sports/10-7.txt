Ivory Coast defeat 10-man Nigeria in Group B opener
Ebenezer Bajela

Defending champions, Nigeria, got their defence of their U-23 Africa Cup of Nations title to a disastrous start and their bid to secure qualification for next year’s Olympics in Tokyo on shaky ground following a 1-0 defeat to Ivory Coast at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo on Saturday.

Olisa Ndah conceded the penalty in the 70th minute before being sent off for the foul and Silas Gnaka scored from the resulting spot kick to put the Young Elephants top of Group B.

Goalkeeper Adamu Abubakar thought he had saved the penalty on the line but the referee ruled it to have crossed the line and gave the goal, although replays later suggested the entire ball didn’t cross the line.

Coach Imama Amapakabo missed the services of captain Azubuike Okechukwu and striker Taiwo Awoniyi who were not released on time by their respective clubs.

The Eagles could have taken the lead in the 65th minute but Orji Okonkwo’s goal-bound header from a corner kick rebounded off the crossbar.

Substitute, Sunusi Ibrahim, came close to getting the equaliser for the team in the 87th minute but his low shot whistled past the post with the Ivoirians holding on for the win.

This is the second time the country will be on the losing end in the opening game of the tournament having experienced same in the inaugural edition of the tournament in 2011 where they lost 1-0 loss to Morocco in their opening game before eventually crashing out.

Imama will hope to have Okechukwu and Awoniyi available when they take on Zambia in their second game on Tuesday November 12 at the Al Salam Stadium, Cairo.
