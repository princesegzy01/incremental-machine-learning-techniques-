The review panel set up to investigate Nigeria’s poor outing at the 2019 World Athletics Championships held in Doha, Qatar has been urged to extend its investigation to the 2019 African Games in Rabat.

The President, Track and Field Coaches Association of Nigeria, Godwin Ogogo, made the appeal in an interview with our correspondent on Wednesday.

The committee set up on Monday had Prof. Ken Angwueje as the chairman, while the members are Dr. Umar Bindir, Rotimi Obajimi, Ibrahim Galadima, Dare Esan, Mary Onyali, Falilat Ogunkoya, and Maria Wophill, secretary.

Both Divine Oduduru and Blessing Okagbare made it known that similar issues that led to their disqualification scare in Doha occurred at the African Games.

“I expect that they will extend their investigation beyond Doha. The challenges facing athletics go beyond what happened in Doha. There were challenges at African Games and other global competitions too,” he added.

The committee, which was handed seven terms of references including evaluation of factors responsible for the poor performance of Team Nigeria at the 2019 World Athletics Championship, is expected to submit its report next week.
