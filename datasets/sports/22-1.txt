Brugge POTM: Okereke in, Dennis out
Kelvin Ekerete

After an impressive display in October, Nigerian forward, David Okereke, has been shortlisted for Club Brugge’s Player of The Month award for October.

After going six games in the league without a goal and losing his starting place in the month of September, the Nigerian bounced back in October scoring three goals in four games including an equaliser against second-placed Standard Liege.

To win the award, Okereke will have to beat in-form goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet; forward, Krépin Diatta; defender, Clinton Mata and midfielder, Hans Vanaken.

This is the second time Okereke will be listed in the Player of The Month award, the forward lost to defender Simon Deli in the August edition of the award.

With four goals and an assist in five games, Vanaken will be favourite for the award. A surprise exclusion from the list is Super Eagles forward, Emmanuel Dennis, who scored three goals in the month of October including a UEFA Champions League brace against Real Madrid.
