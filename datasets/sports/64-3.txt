Akpeyi saves penalty in Chiefs win
Kelvin Ekerete

Super Eagles goalkeeper, Daniel Akpeyi, saved a penalty to help Kaizer Chiefs beat Cape Town City 4-2 on penalties in the first round of the 2019 Telcom Knockout championship away from home.

Cape Town took the lead in the 34th minute through Kermit Erasmus while Samir Nurkovic’s late equalizer in the 84th minute took the game to extra time which also ended in a 1-1 draw leading to penalty shootouts.

Akpeyi saved Cape Town City’s first penalty from Ebrahim Seedat while Taariq Fielies blew his spot kick off the post while Chiefs Lebogang Manyama failed to convert his but Eric Mathoho converted the final kick to see the Chiefs claiming a 4-2 penalty kick win to qualify for the quarter final of the 16 team tournament.

The Amakhosi will have to thank Akpeyi as City were the better side after the restart and Nigeria international Akpeyi became a very busy man in the Chiefs’ goal-posts in the first 20 minutes of the second half.

The experienced shot-stopper made a double save to deny South Africa international Erasmus, before saving Bradley Ralani’s effort.
