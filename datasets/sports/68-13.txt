Allegri taking English class as United speculation grows
Massimiliano Allegri has refused to deny rumours that he could be the new Manchester United head coach.

The former Juventus boss is currently out of a job after leaving the Bianconeri at the end of last season, following yet another Serie A triumph.

United’s sharp decline in form since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was given the managerial post on a permanent basis has seen Allegri linked with the role.

When questioned about the speculation directly, the Italian simply laughed and told Przeglad Sportowy, “I speak English too poorly for now, but I am learning.”

The Red Devils lie 12th in the Premier League table with just one win since the opening day, and most recently were beaten 1-0 by Newcastle United away from home.
