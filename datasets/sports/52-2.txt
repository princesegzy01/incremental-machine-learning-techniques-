Europa: Mikel returns, Aribo eyes fourth goal
Johnny Edward

Mikel Obi is expected to return back to Trabzonspor’s starting line-up when they take on Krassnodar in tonight’s UEFA Europa League clash.

Mikel missed his side’s last game against Gaziantep FK due to a thigh muscle strain but trained with the squad on Wednesday ahead of the tie.

The 32-year-old has made 11 appearances across all competition without an assist nor goal. Trabzonspor are third in Group C with just one point from two games.

His compatriot, Anthony Nwakaeme, will be looking forward to adding to his four goals in European competition.

Rangers’ midfielder Joe Aribo will set his sight on helping the Gers triumph over Porto when they meet in Thursday’s Europa League game.

Aribo only returned to Rangers’ squad last weekend against Hearts, having missed his side’s last three games due to a head injury.

He has scored three goals in 16 games in the competition and adding to his tally will be high on his mind in the encounter.

Steven Gerrard’s men are bottom of Group G tied with other teams on three points due to their inferior goal difference.
