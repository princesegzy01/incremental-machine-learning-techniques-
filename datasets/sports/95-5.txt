Leicester’s Nigerian midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has urged his teammates to move on and continue working hard after their narrow 2-1 defeat to the Reds at Anfield on Saturday.

The Foxes, currently third on the log, came into the clash on the back of an emphatic 5-1 whitewash of Steven Bruce’s Newcastle United last weekend.

Brendan Rodgers’ side have only lost once in the league prior to Saturday’s encounter at Merseyside and have been tipped by pundits as candidates for a top six finish.

The King Power outfit did show up at Anfield and gave Jurgen Klopp’s title chasing side a run for their money.

Sadio Mane had put the hosts ahead in the 40th minute but Leicester drew level in the 80th minute through James Maddison and looked like snatching a draw at Anfield.

But Ndidi and teammates would be denied of a share of the spoils as the Reds were awarded a dying minute penalty after Marc Albrighton brought down Mohamed Salah in the box.

The resultant spot-kick by Milner handed the Foxes their second defeat of the season.

But, the Super Eagles star, on his instagram handle reacted positively to the result.

“Well fought, not the result we wanted, more hard work to be done, we move on,” he wrote on his instagram page.
