Pique dismisses Messi, Griezmann rift
Gerard Pique insists Barcelona stars Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann have a perfectly normal relationship.

The former Spain defender has been quick to play down rumours regarding his two attacking teammates

Earlier this month, new signing Griezmann admitted to finding it “difficult” to connect with Barca’s superstar captain as neither of them are naturally big talkers.

It had been rumoured Messi, who hoped for Neymar’s return, objected to the club’s pursuit of the France international ahead of the Brazilian forward.

Messi has since branded that a “lie” and insisted he has no problem with Griezmann, a claim now supported by Pique.

The experienced centre-back told Spanish broadcaster Cadena SER the pair are on “very good” terms.

“Here, we magnify everything very much,” said the 32-year-old former Spain defender.

“Leo and Grizi get along, the same as Leo and (Ousmane) Dembele get along, or Leo with Pedro or (David) Villa. It’s good. With Luis (Suarez and Messi), they are almost like brothers.
