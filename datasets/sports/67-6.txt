Villarreal starlet Samuel Chukwueze alongside Liverpool star, Sadio Mane and Gunners £72m record-signing, Nicolas Pepe, are the only Africans with high market value rated in the top 50 compiled by Transfermarket and released on Friday.

Chukwueze has cemented his place in the Yellow Submarines’ first team ever since appearing for the senior side in 2018, where he netted his first senior goal in a 3-1 routing of Bilbao. The former Diamond Football Academy star then went on to score 11 more league goals that season as the Estadio Ceramica outfit finished 14th on the La Liga table.

It was a break-out performance that saw him make the Golden Boy Top 40 U-21 stars list in August, before eventually dropping out of the final 20 nominees released on Tuesday by Tuttosport.

According to Transfermarket, he is ranked 32nd out of 50 stars whose market value has shot up since January 1.

The Villarreal winger’s market value is £27m, which has seen an increase of +£22.5m (500 per cent rise)to place him above Barca’s Ansu Fati and Chelsea’s Tammy Abraham, who’re ranked 33rd and 37th respectively.

Liverpool and Senegal striker, Mane, is ranked second with a market value of £108m and market value increase: +£40.5m (60% rise).

Ivorian International, Nicolas Pepe, is fifth with a market value of £63m and market value increase of +£31.5m (87.5% rise).

Chukwueze has already scored four league goals so far for the La Liga outfit this season.
