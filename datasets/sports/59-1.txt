Go get Kane, Keane tells United
Manchester United legend Roy Keane has urged his former club to poach Tottenham striker Harry Kane.

Speaking after United’s 1-1 draw against Liverpool, the ex Old Trafford midfielder – in his role as a Sky Sports pundit – told the club to target England captain Kane in order to cure their long-standing goalscoring problems.

“Just go and get Kane from Spurs. Easy,” said Keane. They’re in disarray, go get him.

Keane’s recommendation was backed up by fellow pundit Graeme Souness, who added, “That’s where Man United should be batting, go for the best. They always have done.”

United have been toothless in front of goal this season and languish in mid-table.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decided to allow Romelu Lukaku to leave for Inter Milan, and Alexis Sanchez followed him on a season-long loan.

Marcus Rashford has not been able to convince in the central starting role, leading many, including Keane to suggest they dig deep into the pockets for a marquee signing.
