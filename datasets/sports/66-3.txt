Nigeria defender, Semi Ajayi, admitted playing against the star-studded Brazil in Super Eagles’ 1-1 draw last Sunday in Singapore has given his confidence a big boost, and revealed how he kept the South Americans’ superstar forwards quiet at the Kallang National Stadium.

The 25-year-old was handed a starting role in the friendly game, partnering stand-in captain William Troost-Ekong at the heart of the Eagles defence, after Kenneth Omeruo pulled out of the game due to injury.

Ajayi posted a decent performance, keeping the Brazilians at bay to help the Eagles secure a draw against the five-time world champions.

Speaking on his club West Bromwich Albion’s website ahead of the weekend game away at Middlesbrough, Ajayi said he hopes to carry the momentum from Singapore to the Baggies.

“I’m feeling really good. The Brazil game went really well. I’ve given myself a lot of confidence coming up against the big stars.

“Hopefully, I can carry that form into our league game on the weekend,” Ajayi told the club website.

“You want to play against the best players and test yourself. If you can come out of that with a good performance and a good result then that is even better so the trip went really well.

“I don’t really focus on their names; it is more about what they do on the pitch. I felt like myself and my teammates dealt with their threats really well and it is something we can take a lot of pride from.”
