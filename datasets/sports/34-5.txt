Golden Eaglets midfielder Ibrahim Sai’d has become the seventh Nigeria player to score a hat-trick in the FIFA U-17 World Cup.

With his goals in Tuesday’s night game against Ecuador that ended 3-2, Sai’d also emerged as the first player to score hat-trick in the 2019 edition of the FIFA U-17 World Cup holding in Brazil.

Trailing 2-1 to Ecuador with five minutes to go, Eaglets, in a repeat of the scenario played out in their opening match against Hungary, managed to turn things around completely, scoring the winner in the 89th minute.

The first Nigerian hat-trick in FIFA U-17 World Cup was scored by Nkwankwo Kanu 26 years ago, while the last one, notched by Victor Osimhen, occurred just two years before.

Confirming Sai’d’s feat, FIFA its website said, “On Tuesday, Ibrahim Sai’d became the seventh Eaglet to hit the back of the net three times in a U-17 World Cup match – more than any other nation.

“One more goal would have seen him equal another record, that of goals scored in a single game, held jointly by another Nigerian (Kelechi Iheanacho, who tallied four times against Mexico at UAE 2013).”

However, Sai’d expressed satisfaction with helping Eaglets to qualify for the Round of 16.

“I just want to make my country proud of the team,” the midfielder said after the Tuesday’s match.
