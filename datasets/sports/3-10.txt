President of the International Olympic Committee, Dr Thomas Bach, has expressed optimism on collaborating with Nigeria to develop sports in the country.

He said this when he arrived Nigeria for a two-day official visit on Wednesday.

Bach, who arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja few minutes past 4pm, was received by the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, and other top government officials.

“It is a great pleasure arriving in Nigeria, a great sporting country. I’m looking forward to a very successful meeting with the government, the International Olympic Committee and most importantly to meet the Nigerian athletes and wish them luck for their qualification and participation in the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.

“I will also have the opportunity to visit the school where the Olympic values are being promoted in an exemplary way, it’s a very rich programme and I’m really looking forward to enjoying the Nigerian hospitality.”

Listing activities line up for the IOC President’s visit, Dare said, “We hope that the next two days will be exciting as we have lined up a number of activities.

“One of the most important is the commissioning of the ANOCA headquarters which is Olympics headquarters for Africa, the visit to the school where Olympic values are taught. We will also be at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium to meet with Olympians and some of our athletes who are on their way to the Olympics 2020.”

Bach, a German lawyer and former Olympic fencer, is the ninth and current President of the IOC.
