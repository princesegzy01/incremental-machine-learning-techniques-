Silva faulted for changing Iwobi’s role

Alex Iwobi’s £34m switch from Arsenal seems to be creating tactical and formation nightmare for manager, Marco Silva.

Iwobi’s arrival did bring about options in attack like Silva himself admitted at the beginning of the season. However, finding the best position or role for the Nigeria international in the midfield seems to be a major headache for the Portuguese.

Iwobi played as number 10 against Sheffield Wednesday in the Carabao and West Ham in the Premier League impressing in both games.

But against Spurs, he was pushed out wide, a decision Liverpool Echo faulted Silva on and believes reduced the former Arsenal attacker’s influence in the clash.

“Iwobi’s influence when playing out wide had faded somewhat – and in fact he looks much more suited to playing in the No. 10 role.

“Silva first trialed that against Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup and was impressed, but it was against West Ham United that the former Arsenal man really took centre-stage.

“He was pivotal to Everton picking up all three points so comfortably that afternoon, getting in spaces between the Hammers lines and causing their defence all sorts of problems with a mixture of powerful dribbling and incisive passing.”

“But a change in formation on Sunday afternoon for the visit of Spurs pushed Iwobi back out wide.

“His influence was undoubtedly affected.

“Suddenly the 23-year-old was struggling to get on the ball. He couldn’t make those passes through to the likes of Richarlison or Walcott,” Liverpoolecho wrote.
