Balogun questions VAR in Reds, United match

Brighton defender, Leon Balogun, has questioned the decision of the Video Assistant Referee to disallow Sadio Mane’s goal in Liverpool’s 1-1 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Mane thought he had equalised for Liverpool in the first half after Marcus Rashford had put United ahead.

The goal was however ruled out after VAR had adjudged the Senegalese to have handled the ball.

Balogun however believed the call was out of place.

He took to Twitter to express his view.

“How’s that a handball? Seriously? Bounces off his thigh against his hand, which is nowhere near an unnatural position, especially if you consider that he has to ‘fight’ the defender off,” Balogun tweeted.

“If possession is gained, which he only did after he got the ball off of the defender’s feet again in my opinion.

“These handball decisions are a part of the game that always will be heavily discussed – not as reasonable as we do now though. But for me this situation is not a handball, regardless of who I’m rooting for,” he added.
