Firm advocates strong retail market for Africa
One of the leading creative advertising firms, Leo Burnett Lagos, has urged brand builders and communicators to discontinue the strategy of building retail across products but people.

The Chief Operating Officer of the company, Lekan Lawal, said this at the just-concluded 2019 Global Africa Forum on Communications held in Kigali, the Rwanda capital.

The theme for this year is ‘Speak for Africa: New frontiers for Africa’s global growth story’.

While contributing at the panel session titled, ‘The future of retail in Africa’, Lawal said, “Retail should be designed around people, not products. It should be designed in the context of multi-channel shopping. We must deliver a relevant message that meets our shoppers’ needs at every channel along her path to purchase.”

According to him, the battle is on the ground already, and Africa is one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the world.

He added that household consumption had increased even faster than its Gross Domestic Product in recent years – and average annual GDP growth had consistently outpaced the global average.

Lawal said, “The vast majority of consumer spending on the continent still currently takes place in informal, roadside markets. But the consumer today holds the most power – better connected, and better informed.”
