Lifemate Furniture last week held a meeting with its dealers, suppliers and business partners where it shared with them how the business had continued to hold its own among competitors.

According to a statement, the event held at its head office showroom at Oregun, Ikeja, Lagos.

The motive of the meeting, according to the Lifemate management, is to further restate the services rendered by the company; its journey so far and how it has been able to remain in business, delivering top-notch and quality furniture products to the Nigerian populace.

The event anchored by Nollywood producer and actor, Mr Christopher Iheuwa, took the guests through a documentary showing the journey of Lifemate Furniture since inception and how it ventured into the African market to become an integral practitioner in the furniture manufacturing industry.

They were also intimated with the company’s business frames and offerings, which covered the conception and production of home furniture products, office furniture, outdoor furniture, kitchen cabinets and sanitary ware.

The challenges being faced by the company were also highlighted.

There were quiz and raffle draws where dealers were rewarded with gift packs and throw pillows, with the ultimate giveaway prize being a hand-massage equipment.

The dealers and business partners of the company were also given the opportunity to ask questions about the services being rendered and all issues were duly responded to by Lifemate Nigeria’s Head, Channels Department, Mr Rogers.

The event also had ridiculously low prices on selected furniture products for dealers to part away with.
