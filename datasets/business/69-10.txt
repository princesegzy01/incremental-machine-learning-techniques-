The Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers has ascribed the introduction of Executive Conversion Programme to academia to the compelling need to attract top notch professionals to deepen research base of Nigeria’s capital market operations.

The President, CIS, Mr Adedapo Adekoje, said the ECP was a temporary window created to attract some of the institute’s leading examiners into securities market to upscale the quality of human capital.

He said the goal was to advance professionalism in capital market studies in order to cope with the challenges of global competitiveness.

Adekoje, who congratulated the participating lecturers, said they had an enormous task of marrying theories with practice in order to improve the quality of research that would enhance investment decision by both indigenous and foreign investors.

The first Vice President, CIS, Mr Olatunde Amolegbe, expressed satisfaction at the level of the participants’ discussion, which reflected their deep knowledge of the financial market.

He said, “The fact that you all have significant pedigree in finance-related discipline and research, we urge you to view this training as a practical approach to your theoretical background.

“This will further integrate you into the business of securities market and also impose on you the necessity to conduct research that will bring about an array of investment opportunities in the capital market.”

The Registrar/Chief Executive Officer, CIS, Mr Adedeji Ajadi, stated that the whole idea was to raise the bar for professional securities dealers in the area of research and development.
