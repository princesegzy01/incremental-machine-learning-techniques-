Sagamites Club, a private socio-economic club in Ogun State, has announced the launch of its annual leadership conference and business support initiative for local businesses in and around Sagamu.

The club, which is made up of business executives across various sectors of the economy, took it upon themselves to enrich their community and commercially empower its citizens.

The President of the Club, Mr Seni Adetu, said the business leadership conference would involve mentorship sessions for youth in the environment.

He said notable among business leaders in the private and public sectors that had been invited to share their career experiences at the event were the Vice- Chancellor, University of Lagos, Prof Toyin Ogundipe; Secretary to the government of Ogun State, Mr Tokunbo Talabi; Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Airtel Nigeria, Mr Segun Ogunsanya; and Chief Executive Officer, Deloitte Nigeria and West Africa, Mr Fatai Folarin.

Adetu disclosed that the club would announce the award of its business support funds to 10 most qualified would-be-entrepreneurs, who would be selected based on merit and business proposition.

He said, “It is a privilege to support the underprivileged; we are inspired by the fact that we are positioned to be of help in changing the narrative of our community youth, from the lamentation of unemployment and perceived laziness, fraudsters and drugs-consuming youth, to that of powerfully and gainfully- employed young adults.”
