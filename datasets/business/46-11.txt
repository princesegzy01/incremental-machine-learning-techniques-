The National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday released the Consumer Price Index which measures inflation with the index rising to 11.24 per cent in September.

The 11.24 per cent represents an increase of 0.22 per cent when compared to the 11.24 per cent recorded in August.

The prices of food items have been on a steady increase since August when the Federal Government closed Nigeria’s borders to neighbouring countries.
