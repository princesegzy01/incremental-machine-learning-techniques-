‘New VAT rate to boost budget execution’
Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja.

The Centre for Social Justice on Thursday said the decision of the Federal Government to increase the Value Added Tax from the current rate of five per cent to 7.2 per cent would increase revenue needed to finance the budget.

The Lead Director, CSJ, Eze Onyekpere, said this in a statement issued in Abuja.

In the statement, he said as a country having one of the lowest tax to Gross Domestic Product ratio, there was a need to increase the tax rate to generate additional revenue.

This, he said, was imperative following claims by the Federal Government that the country was facing fiscal crisis.

He said, “Centre for Social Justice welcomes the decision of the Federal Government in the proposal for an increase in VAT from the current rate of five to 7.2 per cent.”

He added that the new VAT rate would increase available resources for budget implementation and development across the three tiers of government.
