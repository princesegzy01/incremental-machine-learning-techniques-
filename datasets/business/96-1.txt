The immediate past President, Association of Town Planning Consultants of Nigeria, Dr Idris Salako, has asked members of ATOPCON to prepare for urban planning challenges as the nation’s population continues to grow.

Salako, who is also the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development in Lagos State, said the challenges were not insurmountable.

“As professionals in the built environment, we must brace for the urban challenges facing Nigerian cities today,” Salako said at the ATOPCON’s annual general meeting in Lagos.

He said the government still had a lot of roles to play, hence the need to key into the “THEMES” project of the Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to make Lagos a 21st Century economy.

According to Salako, the profession has made progress, as the professionals have raised the bar higher than it used to be.

“What you get by achieving your goal is not as important as what you become by achieving your goal,” he added.

The new President of ATOPCON, Mr Niyi Odetoye, who was elected at the AGM, said the association would continue to promote the development of an enabling environment aimed at the advancement of the town planning practice.

Odetoye stated that the new executive would follow, to logical conclusion, the review of the constitution that had commenced with a view to strengthening the association.
