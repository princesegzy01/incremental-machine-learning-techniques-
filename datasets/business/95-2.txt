Nigeria marks National ID Day
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

The Federal Government on Monday said agencies involved in the collation and management of the personal information of Nigerians must devise ways to protect such data from hackers.

Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, gave the directive at an event held to mark the maiden National Identity Day, organised by the National Identity Management Commission in Abuja.

Nigeria became the first country in the world to celebrate the Identity Day, following the Federal Government’s approval of the recognition and observance of September 12 of every year as National Identity Day.

The choice of September 12 as the ID-Day was informed by Sustainable Development Goals number 16.9, which advocates legal identity for all, including birth registration, by 2030.

The SGF, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Political and Economic Affairs, in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Gabriel Aduda, advised the management of the NIMC to ensure that the personal information of Nigerians in its database was protected from hackers.

He said, “The NIMC should think of ways to safeguard the captured data because protection of personal data is a fundamental human right.

“You have to think faster than hackers. Protection of personal information should be factored into data management.”

Mustapha further urged NIMC to work out ways to unify all biometric data in the country “so as to avoid multiplicity of data capturing” as was the case in the past.
