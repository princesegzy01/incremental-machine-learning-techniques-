Sigma takes pension plans to youths

The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Sigma Pensions, Mr Dave Uduanu, has urged the youths to plan towards saving for their retirement early in a bid to achieve financial independence.

He said this while speaking to youths at a master class session by Sigma Pensions at the Junior achievers conference in Lagos over the weekend.

He said, “By starting pension saving immediately you start working, you are on your way to financial independence. You can start early, how much you save depends on you.

“The trick is that, from studies, if you save 20 to 30 per cent of your income since the day you start working, you are on your way to financial independence.”

Uduanu added that as they became salary earners, they should work towards increasing their savings percentage.

He said, “Now as your income increases, the rate of increase in consumption should be lower than the rate of increase in income, meaning that, your savings rate should go up.

‘So if your income is increasing by 50 per cent a year, but your consumption is increasing by only seven per cent a year, it means that your savings rate must go up.”
