FG won’t neglect women in budgeting – HoS
’Femi Asu

The acting Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, has said the Federal Government will continue to ensure that budgets work for every Nigerian.

Yemi-Esan said her office would facilitate the formulation of gender-smart policies as well as supporting relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies in gathering reliable women-specific data for the nation’s oil and gas industry.

She spoke on Thursday in Lagos at a workshop for women in oil and gas industry organised by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board.

“We will also uphold gender-responsive budgeting through the expansion of gender desks like what obtains in the ministries of Industry, Trade and Investment and Agriculture, and which are targeted at ensuring the inclusion of women and girls in their respective activities,” she said.

The acting HoS lamented the low participation of women in the oil and gas industry, saying, “Further alarming is the almost negligible stock of women who occupy technical or sit in executive boardrooms of oil companies in Nigeria which have been dubbed a boys’ club.

“While men and women apparently set out on a general equal footing, women scarcely reach the top of the organisation. This deficit may superficially be attributed to poor ambition among women; however, a more thorough study of scenario will paint a wider picture.”

She described the NCDMB as the most cardinal stakeholder and driver of gender mainstreaming in the country, “considering its mandate as well as the various mechanisms put in place by the board.”
