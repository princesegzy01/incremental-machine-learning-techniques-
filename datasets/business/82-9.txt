The Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission, Prof. James Momoh, has urged Nigerians to support the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure in order to meet the local content required in revamping the country’s power sector.

Momoh made this plea during a visit to NASENI headquarters in Abuja, a statement signed by the Deputy Director, Information, NASENI, Olusegun Ayeoyenikan, stated on Sunday.

Momoh noted the energy sector was indeed a challenge to the country and Nigeria did not have the required local content.

He said, “For Nigeria to have stable power supply and to get it right in metering and distribution of electricity to citizens, working with NASENI is one way the country could subsidise engineering tools and add value to the growth of the sector.

“We don’t have locally-produced transformers that can work efficiently; and there is dearth of research institutes to support the sector with knowledge and research.”

According to him, NASENI has the vision and mandate for power sector research and development and therefore should be encouraged to carry them out.

He expressed confidence that the challenges would be resolved if the nation could rally support for NASENI.

Momoh expressed hope that with sufficient resources and research capabilities, NASENI would continue to produce and develop meters for the country.

In his response, The Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of NASENI, Prof. Mohammed Haruna, thanked Momoh for having confidence in NASENI.

Haruna said the agency would work together with NERC to ensure Nigerians enjoy consistent power supply.
