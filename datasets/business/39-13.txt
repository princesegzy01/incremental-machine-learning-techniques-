IT projects in MDAs recorded massive failure – NITDA
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

The National Information Technology Development Agency has revealed that ‘wide-scale failure’ was recorded in information technology projects executed by the ministries, departments and agencies of the Federal Government.

The Director-General of the agency, Kashifu Abdullahi, disclosed this at a Public Sector Consumer Protection Forum in Abuja.

A draft Framework for Information Technology Service Level Agreement for MDAs was presented by NITDA at the forum.

NITDA had recently declared that, going by its enabling laws, MDAs are required to get its clearance before embarking on any IT project.

The agency had threatened to report MDAs that embarked on IT projects without its authorisation to President Muhammadu Buhari.

In an address at the Public Sector Consumer Protection Forum in Abuja on Thursday, NITDA DG, Abdullahi, explained that the mass failure of IT projects embarked upon by the MDAs necessitated the development of the draft Framework for Information Technology Service Level Agreement.
