Oyetola stressed that the state planned to develop its agricultural, mining and industrial sectors to create job opportunities for its youth.

He assured the delegates and any other investors interested in establishing businesses in Osun of arable land, good hospitality and adequate security.

He commended the Onirun of Oke-’run, Oba Isaac Ilori, for facilitating the meeting and called on other well-meaning indigenes to encourage more investors to invest in the state to fast-track its development.

In his presentation, the leader of the Japanese delegates, Mr Masayoshi Kora, disclosed that the team had carried out investigations about the state and found it suitable for investment.

He pledged that as soon as the country’s prime minister approved their business proposals, work would commence in the state.
