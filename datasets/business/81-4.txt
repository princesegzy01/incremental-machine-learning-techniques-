FG to set up agency for Artificial Intelligence
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

The Federal Government on Monday said plans were underway for the establishment of an agency that would coordinate Artificial Intelligence and robotics in the country.

Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, gave the hint at a meeting with members of the Nigerian Academy of Science in Abuja.

According to Onu, a research institute or agency is to be set up to coordinate all research activities relating to AI and robotics.

The planned agency would work with tertiary institutions in the country, the minister added.

Noting that currently, no institution was coordinating the AI and robotics research in the country, Onu said, “We believe that when that happens, it will help us to get to know the level of our research in our universities.”
