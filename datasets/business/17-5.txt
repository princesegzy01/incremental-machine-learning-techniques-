The Rector of Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Dr Olusegun Aluko, has said that the institution has continued to upgrade its accountancy department and other departments in the polytechnic to move with the pace of technology advancement in the global space.

He said this while speaking on the recognition given to the polytechnic by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria.

ICAN disclosed it increased exemption subjects for graduates of five tertiary institutions in the country under the ICAN Cooperation Agreement with Tertiary Institutions.

It listed Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, as the only polytechnic among four other universities which had maintained high standards of tuition and learning at their departments of accounting.

Aluko said, “21st century polytechnic is highly technical now. If you don’t move along with technology, technology will leave you.

“Accounting of old days is different from now. That is part of the things that ICAN came and saw in our polytechnic. All our accountancy graduates can use almost all the softwares. It is not only accountancy department, but the whole departments in our polytechnic are on the e-platform, we are really moving with technology.”

According to him, if graduates are not equipped for the effective disruption of financial technology in the system, it would be difficult for them to get jobs.

While speaking further on the ICAN recognition, he said it showed that the polytechnic’s standard was measurable with all other institutions of its class.
