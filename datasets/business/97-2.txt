FEC approves 40% hike in VAT to raise funds
What shaped the past week?

Global: Last week, news of easing trade tensions and a new round of stimulus from the European Central Bank (ECB) drove global market activity. However, the week began on a quiet note, with U.S. and European stocks subdued by local political turmoil in the U.K and losses in tech stocks on Wall Street, while Asia-Pacific markets were positive on the back of strong data releases from the U.S. and China. On Tuesday, focus turned to the impending meeting of the ECB, driving flat trading in Europe, while a downgrade to Ford’s credit rating weighed on the U.S. stock market. Meanwhile, Asian stocks were mixed as China’s producer price index — a key barometer of corporate profitability — fell 0.8% y/y for the month of August. By midweek, European and American markets had improved on the back of thawing Sino-American trade tensions, whilst Asia-Pacific stocks were mixed as investors awaited the ECB’s decision. After the ECB delivered an aggressive stimulus package, cutting interest rates to -0.5% from -0.4% levels and introducing a new bond-buying program, global markets reacted positively, with the S&P 500 (+24bps w/w), NASDAQ (+101bps) and FTSE (+81bps w/w) all closing higher w/w. The SSE (+33bps w/w), NIKKEI (+805bs w/w) and HSI (+561bps w/w) indices also closed positive, while the DJIAA (-1630bps w/w) was the major loser for the week.

Domestic Economy: The Federal Executive Council approved a c.40% increase in the rate of value-added tax (VAT) to 7.2%. Once signed into law, this would represent the first increase since the VAT was first introduced in Nigeria in 1993 and is in line with the Federal Inland Revenue Service’s (FIRS) plan to increase Nigeria’s revenue. s. According to the Minister of Finance, the hike is aimed at increasing revenue allocation to States and Local governments in a bid to expedite the implementation of the minimum wage. The VAT was selected because state and local governments are the primary beneficiaries of the revenue (Federal – 15%, State – 50%, Local – 35%), as opposed to the general revenue sharing formula (Federal – 52.7%, State – 26.7% and Local – 20.6%). Furthermore, we note that this move is a continuation of the FIRS’ drive to improve non-oil revenues in Nigeria, following previous programs such as the VAIDS and VOARS. The taxes collected by the FIRS form a major part of Federation revenues (FIRS contributed c.60% of Federation Account Income over the past three months). Recently, the Service has also announced a VAT on online transactions scheduled to commence in January 2020 and has been considering the idea of a separate VAT on luxury items. Overall, if deployed effectively, the additional funds could support government revenue at all levels, reducing deficits and external financing requirements.

Equities: The NSE ASI closed out the week on a positive note, closing 233bps up w/w. The week began on a negative note, with losses on NESTLE (-41bps w/w), STANBIC (-541bps w/w) and ACCESS (+502bps w/w) dragging the bourse. The losses extended into Tuesday, amid bearish trading amongst heavyweight stocks such as GUARANTY (+535bps w/w), ZENITHBANK (+583bps w/w) and DANGCEM (-19bps w/w). However, the market turned positive at midweek, supported by gains in SEPLAT (+15.67% w/w), FCMB (-828bps w/w) and NESTLE. A 101bps gain on Thursday was spurred by positive activity across all sectors, with the Oil and Gas (+719bps w/w) ending the week as the best performer. The Consumer Goods (+57bps w/w) and Banking (+506bps w/w) sectors also closed the week as net gainers, whilst the Industrial Goods sector (-41bps w/w) was the sole loser for the week. Activity levels were subdued, with market turnover declining 17.6%% w/w to N14.1 billion amid weak trade activity and signs of lukewarm investor sentiment despite the positive movements.

Fixed Income: The CBN held two OMO auctions last week, offering N450 billion and selling N424 billion across the three maturities at stop rates of 11.59%, 11.79% and 13.50% respectively. They also held their bi-weekly PMA on Wednesday, offering and selling N158.65 billion across the 91DTM, 182DTM and 364DTM bills at stop rates of 11.10%, 11.79% and 13.28%. Meanwhile, in the secondary market, activity was mixed, with yields advancing 8bps w/w. Most notably, the yield on the 146DTM bill advanced 61bps w/w. In the bond space, activity was muted once again but with a positive tilt, as the average yield on benchmark bonds declined 4bps w/w, with the most notable yield movement occurring on the 15.54% FGN FEB 2020 bond, which declined 165bps w/w.

Currency: The Naira appreciated N0.04 w/w at the I&E FX Window to settle at N362.04 and appreciated N1.50 w/w to settle at N358.50 against the dollar in the parallel market.

What will shape markets in the coming week?

Equity market: With the ASI printing a positive w/w performance, significant bellwethers gaining during the week and most sectors closing higher, there appears to be an improved level of confidence in the domestic market leading to bargain hunting in fundamentally sound stocks which were trading at their lows. However, having exhibited similar trading patterns in the past, the possibility of profit-taking action on gains made last week cannot be overruled.

Fixed Income market: Due to constrained liquidity and a lack of interest on the short-term bills, we expect further yield advances in the secondary T-bills market at the start of the week. Also, we expect further muted activity in the bond space to start the week.

Currency: We expect the naira to remain largely stable across the various windows of the currency space as the CBN maintains interventions in the FX market.

Focus for the week

ACCESS BANK PLC H1’19 Earnings

Stronger asset yield comes to the rescue

ACCESS recently released its H1’19 audited results; its maiden audit post-merger. Gross earnings increased by 28% y/y and 3% q/q to N324.4 billion in H1’19 (H1 2018: N253.0 billion), with interest income contributing 84%. Interest Income grew by 46% y/y to N257.9 billion from N186.7 billion in H1’18. The bank realized a Yield on Asset (YoA) of 13.4% from 12.2% in H1’18. On the other hand, Non-Interest Income decreased by 22% y/y to N51.5 billion from N66.1 billion in H1’18. These results deviated considerably from our topline estimates, with Q2’19 Interest Income 38.9% higher than expected, while Q2’19 Non-interest Income underperformed significantly due to a net Foreign Exchange loss. That said, PBT for the period was up 62% y/y to N74.1 billion (Q2’19: N29.0, billion down 36% q/q) but 10.0% below our estimate, while PAT increased by 59% to N63.0 billion (Q2’19: N21.9 billion, down 47% q/q) 16% behind our estimate. The bank recorded Q2’19 EPS growth of 40% y/y to N1.90 with an annualized Return on Average Equity (ROAE) of 23.5% (FY’18: 19.17%) and a Return on Average Asset (ROAA) of 2.2% (FY’18: 2.5%) for the quarter.

Improved Interest income cushions Foreign exchange loss

In Q2’19, ACCESS garnered Interest Income of N162.1 billion (Q1’19: N110.8 billion), as the bank realized a 138% y/y surge in Interest Income from investment securities along with a 15% y/y rise in interest income from loans. Net Interest Income also came in strong at N98.3 billion during the quarter (up 82% y/y and 73% q/q) with NIM improving by 200bps y/y to 7.6% due to the bank’s success in containing interest expense growth to 16% y/y and 18% q/q (Cost of Funds decreased 100bps y/y to 4.8% from 5.8% in H1’18). However, the bank realized a N25.1 billion loss in Q2’19 from foreign exchange trading, revaluation losses and derivative instruments. This loss eroded the N6.2 billion realized in Q1’19 and overshadowed the impressive q/q growth of 68% in Net Fee Income (Q2’19 – N26.2 billion), thereby limiting non-interest income to just N2.1 billion for Q2’19. Furthermore, Earnings were also dragged by a 21% q/q growth in Opex to N69.9 billion tracked 12% ahead of our estimate. Operating income of N100.4 billion however missed our Q2’19 estimate by 3.7%, though the 36% y/y growth in H1’19 offset the Opex growth of 30% y/y to improve cost-income ratio to 61% from 65% in H1’18.

Restructuring, recoveries improve post-merger asset quality

ACCESS has expanded total assets by 31% since FY’18 to N6.4 trillion with liabilities (customer deposits) of N4.2 trillion up 63% YTD, expanding faster than core assets (loans and advances up 34% YTD to N2.9 trillion) during the period. Asset quality (measured by NPLs) has improved since Q1’19 (10.0%) to 6.4% in H1’19, albeit above the H1’18 (Pre-merger) figure of 4.7% – loan restructuring and a few recoveries have reduced NPLs by just over N100 billion post-merger. The banks LDR of 66% remains well above the CBN floor of 60%, while its CAR remains adequate at 20.8% flat y/y.

TP revised to N12.43 (Previous: N8.42)

We have adjusted our estimates to reflect the higher interest income realized in H1’19 and trimmed our FY’19 non-interest expectations. Our new topline estimates for interest income and non-interest income are N507 billion (Previous: N396 billion) and N190 billion (Previous: N222 billion) respectively. Operating income is adjusted slightly higher to N444 billion from N418 billion while our FY’19 PAT figure has increased to N155.1 billion (Previous: N126.5 billion). As at September 9, ACCESS shares traded at a P/B multiple of 0.4x, a 50% discount to peer average of 0.8x. The bank is on track to surpass its FY’18 ROAE of 19.7% with a H1’19 annualized ROAE return of 23.5%. Overall, we revise our 12-month Target Price to N12.43 from N8.42, following an upward revision in our 2019 ROAE estimate, and FY’19 dividend forecast to N1.08/share.
