Ted Odogwu, Kano

The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate has said it has commenced the verification of no fewer than 13,000 pensioners in the North-West.

The Executive Secretary of the directorate, Mrs Chioma Ejikeme, disclosed this on Tuesday in Kano.

She said the exercise was expected to last 10 days, describing the turnout as very encouraging. She added that all the pensioners would be captured in the data base and would be paid as and when due.

Ejikeme said the pensioners were happy and calm, as they were treated with respect, adding that they were served lunch, while the exercise was in progress.

She said, ‘’First of all, we are to get to what I will call, the baseline, and the baseline is making sure that every pensioner, who deserves to be on the data base, is brought on the date base.

“We will settle the arrears of all pensioners. When we get that done, the next step is their welfare. We are thinking about getting insurance for all pensioners.”

Commenting on the amount so far expended on the pensioners, Ejikeme said the total amount spent ran into billions of naira.
