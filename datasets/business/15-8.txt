In April, the CBN disclosed that a $44.1m was spent on debt service; it moved to $189.67m in May, the second highest amount spent on debt service by the apex bank in one month.

In June, the amount dropped to $18.57m; in July, it rose to $126m. For August and September, the figures reported by the CBN were $199.8m and $160m, respectively.

A member of the committee, Dr Robert Asogwa, in his personal statement, said, “Based on the Bond Issuance Calendar of the Debt Management Office, there were three additional FGN bond auctions in July, August and September to raise money to part-finance the 2019 federal budget while additional issuance of Eurobond is expected in the later part of 2019 or early 2020.

“As the threat of debt vulnerability continues, a coordinated domestic revenue expansion with simultaneous fiscal prudence as suggested in the last MPC meeting still remains the key to addressing the weak fiscal position of the economy.”

Another member, Prof. Dahiru Balami, said the major risks and vulnerabilities to Nigeria economy were security challenges, slow economic growth, low government revenue and growing federal and state government debts.

The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had said that Nigeria’s debt was not as worrisome as people thought.

She insisted that despite the foreign and domestic debt stock, Nigeria had no debt crisis.

Another member of the MPC, Mr Mike Idiah, said the fiscal authority would need to appreciate the urgency of implementing fiscal reforms aimed at boosting non-oil revenue mobilisation significantly, particularly the tax revenue.
