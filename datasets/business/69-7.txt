The United States Justice Department has closed its investigations into alleged corruption by oil major Eni in Nigeria and Algeria without taking any action, the Italian energy group has said.

Eni, the biggest foreign oil and gas producer in Africa, is currently on trial in Milan on graft allegations revolving round the acquisition of a giant Nigerian oilfield in 2011, Reuters reported on Tuesday.

In the case, Eni and peer, Royal Dutch Shell, were accused of buying the Oil Prospecting Licence 245 offshore field for about $1.3bn in a deal that spawned one of the industry’s largest graft scandals.

Milan prosecutors alleged that about $1.1bn of the total was siphoned off to pay politicians, businessmen and middlemen.

Eni and Shell had denied any wrongdoing.

“Today’s decision by the Department of Justice confirms the findings of independent advisors, who conducted investigations into the claims which also found no illegal activity,” Eni said.
