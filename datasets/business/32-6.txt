Council wants compulsory insurance for Nigerians
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers has written to the House of Representatives, asking the parliament to amend laws towards making insurance compulsory for Nigerians and their property.

The NCRIB also urged the House to accelerate passage of national budgets, which would lead to timely payment of premium on insurance services provided for the Federal Government’s workers and assets.

The Deputy President, NCRIB, Dr Bola Onigbogi, presented the petition addressed to the Chairman, House Committee on Insurance and Actuarial Matters, Mr Darlington Nwokocha, in Abuja on Wednesday.

In the petition, a copy of which our correspondent obtained, the council called on the lawmakers to conduct regular and periodic review of the laws on insurance to make them conform with developments globally.

The council said, “The existing insurance laws had made provision for some compulsory insurances and they include third party motor insurance, insurance of building under construction, insurance of public building, etc. However, the mode of enforcement and the agencies saddled with the responsibility of enforcement of these insurances were not provided in the law.”
