The President of Dangote Industries Limited, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for constituting an Economic Advisory Council to advise him on the nation’s economic growth and overall development.

According to a statement, he described the move as a proactive one capable of elevating Nigeria’s economy to greater heights.

Dangote, who spoke at the inauguration of the new secretariat of the Chemical and Non-Metallic Products Employers Federation, described members of the council as “tested and respected patriots, who are independent and always ready to put the country’s interest first and ahead of themselves.”

He urged the Federal Government to take advantage of the rare opportunity to strengthen the economy and put the country on the path of growth, job creation and competitiveness.

Africa’s richest man also called on all stakeholders to work with the FG to revive and restore the economy on the path of growth.

He said the government should continue to provide the enabling environment so that the private sector would thrive in the Buhari administration’s next level.

The entrepreneur described CANMPEF as the largest employers of labour, having members spread across many sectors and commended the leadership for its achievements so far.

The Minister of State for Industries, Trade and Investment, Ambassador Maryam Katagum, who represented her minister, Chief Adeniyi Adebayo, said the government would continue to initiate the necessary right policy that would propel the private sector members to thrive as the drivers of the economy.
