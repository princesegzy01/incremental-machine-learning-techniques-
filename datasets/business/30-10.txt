Dangote Group has emerged the most valuable brand in Nigeria in the 2019 Top 50 Brand survey, a statement indicated.

Dangote was closely trailed by telecommunication company, MTN, as the most valuable multinational and telecommunication brand with Glo coming third in the chart.

These top brands, according to statement, will be honoured at the #IAMBRANDNIGERIA award and gala in Lagos next month.

Dangote Group, again, took the lead this year following its 2018 feat. This made Dangote double as the most valuable overall and Nigeria brand in the 2019 review.

Dangote is the most diversified and largest conglomerate in West Africa and one of the largest in the continent.

According to the Chief Executive Officer/Country Director, Top 50 Brands Nigeria, Taiwo Oluboyede, Dangote Cement, a member of the group, is the most capitalised company on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.

“Dangote is expected to deliver its 650 thousands barrel per day capacity crude oil refinery with the world tallest atmospheric tower in the coming year,” he added.

He added that MTN, despite negative narratives had continued to grow stronger, maintaining its second placement in the annual ranking.

Oluboyede said concerning Glo, “Another telecom company, Globacom, fully owned by Nigerians, came third with 75.2 brand strength measurement points. Glo started the year with the unveiling of the World Heavy Weight Champion, Anthony Joshua as its brand ambassador. It is also a brand known for support of entertainment and sport.”
