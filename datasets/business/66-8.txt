About 314.15 million new telephone numbers have been provided for telecommunications operators from the National Numbering Plan of the Nigerian Communications Commission.

The new telephones numbers were added in the first quarter of 2019 and belonged to about 44 licensed telecom operators.

The numbering plan is used to allocate a unique national number to each subscriber connected to the national telephone system.

Some of the operators with national and states licences, according to a document on NNP from NCC, are MTN Nigeria Communications, Vodacom, Globacom, Natcom, 9Mobile, 21st Century Technologies Limited, Airtel Networks Limited and Cyberspace Limited.
