Maritime security: Navy urges IOC’s to share intelligence
Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

The Nigerian Navy has urged international oil companies operating in the Niger Delta region to ensure information and intelligence sharing as parts of efforts to combat oil theft and achieve a safe environment in the region.

The Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice-Admiral Ibok Ete-Ibas, stated this on Tuesday when he received the Managing Director of Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited, Mr Lorenzo Fiorillo, at the naval headquarters in Abuja.

The naval chief expressed concerns over the illegally- sourced petroleum products by some oil industry operators, adding that such violated global best practices. According to a release from the navy by the Director of Information, Commodore Suleman Dahun, Ete-Ibas, commended Agip for the existing collaboration between the company and the navy, particularly the provision of berthing facilities by the company to Nigerian Navy ships.

“The Chief of the Naval Staff urged international oil companies to ensure sustained information and intelligence sharing with security agencies towards a secured operating environment in the Niger Delta.

“According to the CNS, with the sustained induction of new ships into the navy’s inventory, provision of berthing facilities will enable the navy respond adequately to threats in the maritime environment.

“The CNS also requested for regular over flight reporting of incidences of maritime security interest observed in the course of Agip routine operations to the navy.”
