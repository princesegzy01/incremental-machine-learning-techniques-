Mudiaga Affe

The United Niger Delta Energy Development Security Strategy on Monday said the region would not accept the proposed amendments to the National Inland Waterways Act and the act setting up the Niger Delta Development Commission.

In a statement on Monday by its Executive Secretary, Mr Tony Uranta, UNDEDSS also rejected the resubmission of the list of nominees to the board of the NDDC which showed the Presidency’s alleged disregard for the rule of law.

The statement read, “We can no longer continue this way with fundamental injustices by the Federal Government of Nigeria, including the federal executive’s present attempt to breach both the Land Use Act and the NDDC Act. The proposed amendment to the NIWA Act is RUGA by other methods, and we reject it in its totality.
