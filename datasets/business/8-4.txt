Institute seeks policy against judgment debts
The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators Nigeria Branch has called on the Federal Government to put in place a national arbitration policy to prevent accumulation of judgment debts.

The Chairman of the institute, Mr Olatunde Busari, made the call in Lagos on Friday at a two-day annual conference tagged “Positioning Africa: The Changing Landscape in Alternative Dispute Resolution.”

Busari said it was important to improve the capacity of dispute resolvers in Africa as the continent moved to increase economic relations with other continents.

He said, “As mediation takes the center stage in the new UN treaty on mediation, it has become necessary to undertake an in-depth study of the Singapore Convention and its implication for cross border settlement in Nigeria.”

The Chartered Arbitrator, Africa Trustee, Mr Kariuki Muigua, said that the ADR was not a new concept in Africa but a way of life.

According to him, Africans have been known for hundreds of years to sit down and negotiate, meditate and arbitrate. Good neighbourliness, harmony and peace have been a key pillar of African societies.
