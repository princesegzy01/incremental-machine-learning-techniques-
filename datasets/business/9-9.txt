The Nigerian Ports Authority has said that 95 per cent of the cargoes in Nigeria was transported by road using trucks, adding that this was not efficient.

The Managing Director, NPA, Hadiza Bala-Usman, said this while receiving members of the House of Representatives Committee on Ports who paid working visit to the NPA.

Bala-Usman, who was represented by the Executive Director, Finance and Administration, Mohammed Bello-Koko, said, “Over 95 per cent of the cargoes coming into the ports are taken through trucks and that is not efficient.

“There must be multimodal means of transportation to include trains and barges in order to reduce congestion and we are working towards this.”

In his remarks, the chairman of the committee, Garba Mohammad, told stakeholders that the visit was to avail the committee with the workings of the ports and find out ways that the house could enhance port operations.
