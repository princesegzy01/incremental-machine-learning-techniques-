NIWA denies padding 2020 budget
The National Inland Waterways Authority has denied the allegation that the agency manipulated its 2020 budget by padding it with N4bn.

The National Assembly had reportedly uncovered the alleged budget padding that over N4bn had been appropriated for various items including procurement of dredgers and other equipment between 2017 and 2019, for which N1.5bn was also proposed in NIWAâ€™s 2020 proposal.

The lawmakers observed that N2.2bn was appropriated for the project in the 2018 and an additional N1bn in 2019

Responding to the report, the National Spokesman for NIWA, Mr Tayo Fadile, said the agency was not involved in any such infractions.
