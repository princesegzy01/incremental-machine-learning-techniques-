Flour Mills of Nigeria Plc has said its profit after tax increased by 16 per cent to N5.9bn for the six-month period ended June 30, 2019.

The company said in its financial statement that it sustained growth in its profit after tax while it recorded a six per cent growth in its volume.

Profit before tax increased to N8.6bn from N8.3bn in the first half of 2018 while finance cost reduced by 21 per cent to N8.8bn, compared to the N11.2bn recorded in the same period in 2018.

The company said despite the challenging operating environment and continuing pressures on the profitability of most companies in the fast-moving consumer good sector, its financial statement reflected the managementâ€™s strategy and commitment to growth and value creation.

It said although the revenue from some of its food businesses was adversely impacted by lower volumes, Pasta and Noodles recorded positive growth in base products and the sugar business continued to show remarkable growth in line with projections.

The Group Managing Director, Flour Mills, Paul Gbededo, said he was confident that the company was on track to achieving its growth targets for the year as it continued to improve operational efficiency, reduce finance cost and ultimately grow the wealth of shareholders by increasing earnings per share.
