Kaduna dry port woos northern business community
Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

The Kaduna Inland Dry Port Limited, manufacturers, northern business community and other major stakeholders on Thursday gathered in Kaduna to discuss the importance of utilising the dry port for import and export purposes.

The Port General Manager, Mr Rotimi Raimi, while speaking at the a one-day sensitisation workshop themed, “Optimising import and export of non-oil produce through Kaduna Inland Dry Port’, urged the northern business community to patronise the port.

According to him, the port offers convenient and easier means of moving non-oil products, adding that the sensitisation programme was organised to let farmers and the business community know more about the port.

He noted that by patronising the port, the economy and commercial activities in both Kaduna and the North would leap forward.

He added the port would create wealth and employment for youths in various areas of economic development.

“The dry port facility is positioned for the patronage of import and export of produce, as Nigeria is blessed with mineral resources.

“We cannot continue to rely on oil as our major source of revenue; Kaduna State has one of the best quality ginger in the world and there are many other crops and solid minerals yet untapped,” he said.

The Executive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers’ Council, Mr Hassan Bello, said dry ports would remain inactive if Nigerians failed to utilise them for importing and exporting non- oil products.
