The Kwara State Government says it is excited about the establishment of an assembly plant in Ilorin, the state capital, by a private firm.

It has therefore promised to support the firm and other investors to boost the state’s economy and make life more meaningful for the people of the state.

The State Deputy Governor, Mr Kayode Alabi, stated this in Ilorin shortly after inspecting Padson Assembly Plant at Irewolede.

The plant owned by a private manufacturer, Padson Industries, will assemble trucks, cars, tricycles and motorcycles as well as production of paints.

Alabi said that he was impressed with what he saw on the ground, describing it as “an indication that investors are ready to make use of the abundant human and natural resources available in the state.”

The deputy governor stated that the Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq-led government would create the enabling environment for businesses to thrive in the state.

He noted that the coming of the assembly plant would create employment opportunities and help in developing the state economy.

Alabi urged the management of the firm not to relent in its efforts, adding that the move would benefit the state and its people.

While conducting the deputy governor round the plant, the Chairman, Padson Industries Limited, Mr Hezekial Adedeji, called for government patronage and other forms of support such as showcasing the products to other states.

He added that if supported, the firm would create more job opportunities for Kwarans and other people living in the state.

He said that people would also be trained in automobile maintenance and repairs and other related services at the outfit.
