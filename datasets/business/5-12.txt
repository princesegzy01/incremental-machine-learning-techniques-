Bankers meet to tackle liquidity issues
Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja

Treasurers and financial controllers of non-interest banks in Nigeria have met to work out solutions to liquidity management challenges that affect non-interest banks in the country.

They met in Abuja and agreed to redefine the present narrative on non-interest financial institutions, while forging a common framework that will boost the growth and rapid development of the industry.

Speaking at the inaugural session of Non-Interest Finance Association of Nigeria, in Abuja, the Managing Director, TAJBank, Norfadelizan Rahman, said Nigeriaâ€™s non-interest banking industry had enormous potential.

He said despite the potential, the sector would require the efforts of relevant stakeholders to drive and maximise growth to ensure that it took a stronger position in the economy.

While giving examples of different jurisdictions where non-interest banking had been successful, he urged participants to add value to the industry through innovative products.

Rahman urged the association to create a clear agenda that would strengthen the industry for the development of the economy.
