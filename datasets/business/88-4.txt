Leadway Pensure Pension Fund Administrator has said a more diverse retirement plan will guarantee entrepreneurs financial freedom and peace of mind.

The company said in a statement that rather than concentrate all efforts and resources in the running of a business, entrepreneurs could start preparing for retirement by exploring other alternatives while still running the business.

The Brand and Corporate Communications Manager, Leadway Pensure PFA, Bamiyo Awonusi, said the company had five retirement plans that would be beneficial to entrepreneurs.

He urged entrepreneurs to establish a passive income, set up a self-running business, get a financial advisor, have a home before retirement, and open a retirement savings account.

Awonusi said, “You can open a retirement savings account with a PFA. The benefits of opening a retirement savings account (also known as pensions account) are enormous.

“Your future financial future is secured as you are guaranteed regular income from the time you hit the age of retirement (usually 50 years and above). Also, your contributions are invested to yield valuable returns.”
