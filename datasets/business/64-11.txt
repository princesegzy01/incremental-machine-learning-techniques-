Car dealers besiege Customs office with vehicle documents
Anna Okon

Car dealers on Wednesday visited the Nigeria Customs Service, Federal Operations Unit, Zone ‘A’ with documents of their vehicles for inspection.

This followed the raid on some car sales’ outlets in Lagos by men of the NCS Comptroller General’s task force and officers attached to the FOU. This led to the closure of a number of car marts.

It was gathered also that those who had their papers inspected were later escorted by the Customs officials to the car sales points for further inspection of the vehicles.

“If the vehicles are found to be genuinely imported, the shops would be opened,” a customs officer told our correspondent.

Customs had shut some car marts inside the popular Berger Yard along Oshodi Apapa Expressway on Saturday.

It was learnt that the service shut the marts on suspicion that they harboured cars smuggled into the country through the Seme border.
