9mobile is set to deploy smart off-grid technology to power its new telecom sites as part of its plans to expand voice and data services in Nigeria.

A statement on Tuesday stated that 9mobile’s infrastructure partner, Raeanna Nigeria Limited, had selected Clear Blue Technologies International for the pilot of the project in two sites situated in Southern Nigeria.

It said the pilot sites would serve as proof of concept for a the construction of 100 2G/3G/4G sites in urban and suburban areas of Nigeria by 2020.

“The two sites in southern Nigeria are proof-of-concepts for a planned much larger 2G/3G/4G project. 9mobile and Raeanna hope to roll out 100 sites in 2020 that will deliver voice and data connectivity in urban and suburban areas of Nigeria,” the statement said.

“Based on the success of our previous collaborations, Clear Blue was the only choice to be the power systems provider for this exciting new project,” said Executive Director of Raeanna Nigeria Limited, Tunji Alabi.

Clear Blue said its engineers uses its Illumience platform to manage, control and operate all power systems remotely, ensuring the high availability and service levels needed for telecom services.

9mobile in August secured $230m loan facility from Africa Finance Corporation to improve network efficiency for the growth and profitability of the company.
