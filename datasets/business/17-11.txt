‘Property co-ownership, crowd-funding boosting real estate investment’
Adelani Adepegba

The Managing Director, Drekford Global Concept Limited, Mr Daniel Oparinde, has said that property co-ownership and crowd-funding are boosting investment in the real estate sector in the country.

He noted that co-ownership of property had reduced the investment cost and enabled many young Nigerians to dabble in real estate business, which he described as viable, lucrative and more stable than the money market.

Oparinde told journalists in an interview in Abuja that his company was already providing a platform for co-ownership of properties for many Nigerians who could not otherwise afford the huge capital required in real estate investment.

He said his firm had democratised real estate investment by encouraging crowd-funding for property ownership, noting that Nigerians could now own property at a very low amount.

He stated, “We have tried to democratise real estate investment by making sure that people can come in with a small amount compared to the big amount that is expected in the times past and this comes by way of crowd-funding or co-ownership.

“For instance, in some of our projects like the Seasons’ Apartment, we have platforms for co-ownership. What that means is that you can co-own a property with other owners or other investors.”
