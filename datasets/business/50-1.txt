The Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria has revealed plans to honour a former governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, for his strides in housing provision.

The association said its national executive council had finalised plans to institutionalise the former governor’s contribution in an annual programme known as Lateef Jakande Annual Lecture on Housing.

In a statement signed by the spokesperson for REDAN, Mr Festus Adebayo, the association said Jakande’s achievements in the area of housing, especially when he was the governor of Lagos State from 1979 to 1983, had been unparalleled.

“The event which will take place on November 21, 2019 in Lagos will be attended by developers, engineers, architects, surveyors, town planners, and all relevant stakeholders in housing,” Adebayo said.

He added that the council looked critically at his contribution to homeownership in Lagos where the houses he provided were still giving succour to thousands of Nigerians after many years.

“The council therefore considered it necessary to institutionalise an annual lecture series in his honour which will be proffering solutions to housing issues and recommending ideas that will advance Nigeria’s housing sector,” he added.

According to him, given his significant contributions, Jakande who was the pioneer president of REDAN is very befitting of such an honour from an organisation he once led successfully.

Adebayo said, “It is an appreciation of his immense contributions. There is no better gift stakeholders can give to Alhaji Jakande for his meritorious service over the years than to celebrate him while he is still alive.”
