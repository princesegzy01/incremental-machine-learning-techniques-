Firm launches new lab facility
Symrise Nigeria has launched its new application laboratories in Lagos.

According to the Managing Director of the company, Rudy McLean, the laboratories would deepen the company’s presence in West Africa and service Nigeria’s consumer demands by sourcing their production inputs locally.

He said the company would also help Nigerian manufacturers create affordable consumer brands such as beverages, toothpaste, cereals, detergents, washing liquid, beauty products and personal hygiene products.

“Making such items affordable is central to the company’s strategy because of the unique economic situation in the Nigerian market,” he added.

Speaking on what informed the decision to do business and build application labs in Nigeria, the President, EAME Fragrance and Oral Care, Thomas Dressler, said, “Even though we have a large sales department here, the products for the Nigerian market were developed outside the country.

“To serve Nigerians better, we need to be close enough to the Nigerian people and products to understand them and give better-suited products to the Nigerian consumers. That informed our decision.”

On his part, the Vice- President, Flavour Sales EAME, Alexander Lichter, added that doing business in Nigeria had its own challenges.

He, however, said, “Challenges are not exclusive to Nigeria; we see all the challenges in all other countries where we have a presence and we are used to it. However, the prevailing factor for us is that we recognise the opportunities in West Africa and Nigeria and we tap into them.”
