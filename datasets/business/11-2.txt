Reps uncover FCT IRS illegal accounts
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The House of Representatives has uncovered a commercial bank account being maintained by the Federal Capital Territory Inland Revenue Service.

The House Committee on Public Accounts on Thursday grilled top officials of the FCT-IRS, who denied authorising transactions on the account, for several hours.

Chairman of the committee, Mr Wole Oke, said the panel, at its last investigative hearing, uncovered the FCT-IRS account domiciled with Polaris Bank.

Based on this, Oke said the committee summoned the Managing Director of the bank who availed lawmakers a copy of the statement account the agency maintained with the bank.

Appearing before the committee in Abuja on Thursday, the Director of Treasury, FCTA, who is also Vice-Chairman of the FCT-IRS, Mr Isiaku Ismaila, insisted that the account was not operated by the FCT Treasury after the introduction of the TSA.

Ismaila also claimed to have contacted his Head of Centre Pay Office to ask about the said account.
