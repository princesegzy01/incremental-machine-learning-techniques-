The Association of Registered Insurance Agents of Nigeria has urged the agents in the industry to embrace insurance in order to boost the industry.

The President, ARIAN, Ademola Ifagbayi, said this during the 2019 Insurance Awareness Fitness Walk tagged, ‘Secure child education, secure the future, save Nigeria’, in Lagos.

Agents and some other stakeholders in the industry trekked from Yaba to Oyingbo market and educated people on how to secure their lives and properties with insurance.

He said, “Insurance agents are the middlemen between policyholders and insurance companies. Agents should embrace ICT platforms in the sale of insurance products and services for better and faster service delivery to policyholders across the country.”

The ARIAN boss observed that it could be difficult for some parents to send their children to tertiary institutions if no proper arrangements were made.

He urged parents to plan for their children’s education from an early age through insurance plans.

A policyholder,Segun Adeyemi, urged insurance agents to take advantage of the social media platforms to reach out to the uninsured in the country.

Adeyemi, said technology would help to make insurance agents more relevant, while increasing yearly premium income of the industry as well as improved service delivery.

He said the agents assisted their respective companies to initiate easy ways of paying premium and settling claims.

According to him, digital technology plays a vital role in business transformation.
