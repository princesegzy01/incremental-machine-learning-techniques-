Access Bank says it is committed to driving digital compliance with regulatory rules.

The Managing Director, Access Bank, Herbert Wigwe, said this during a seminar on digital compliance by the bank for its managers in Lagos.

Wigwe, who was represented by the Executive Director, Business Banking Division, Chizoma Okoli, said, “In Access Bank, we take compliance seriously because it is important, it drives the way we do business and we ensure we keep compliance with all the regulators and all those involved. Now we are talking about digital compliance because that is the way to go.”

“When an organisation digitises its processes, it goes global and it is able to monitor its operations and everything it does,” he added.

He, however, said that the bank was aware that digitisation also had its own threats.

“If you digitise most of your processes, it will help you to know your customers better,” he said.

The Associate Director, Corporate Governance, Enterprise Risk Management & Compliance, PriceWaterHouseCoopers, Chukwunomnso Anyichie, said technology had come to stay, and it was no longer a choice but a must for organisations to digitise their process.

She commended Access Bank for recognising digitalisation in compliance level and its operations.

According to her, the large number of senior management team that attended the seminar showed the importance that the bank attached to digital compliance.

The Managing Director, Data BRO, Mr Abimbola Adesoyoju, said, the institute would continue to identify with Access Bank in all its efforts at deepening regulatory compliance in the sector.
