Agencies risk sanctions for non-performance — Communications minister
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

Minister of Communications, Dr Isa Ibrahim, has warned agencies under the ministry that there would be sanctions if they fail to meet up with set targets.

The minister recently issued Key Performance Indicators to the heads of various agencies under the ministry.

The KPIs would form the basis for periodic assessment of the establishments and their managements.

Speaking while declaring open the 2019 Strategic Retreat of the board and management of the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited in Abuja on Thursday, the minister warned that agencies which failed to perform would be sanctioned.

“We will measure your performance from time to time, where you do well, you will receive a lot of encouragement but where you go wrong, you will definitely be sanctioned,” Ibrahim said.

The strategic management retreat was aimed at developing an action plan to restructure NIGCOMSAT.

Ibrahim said the company must improve on its level of visibility and commercialisation to be able to deliver on the investments made by the Federal Government in establishing it.

He noted that ongoing debate over the status and future of the agency had led to a dilemma.
