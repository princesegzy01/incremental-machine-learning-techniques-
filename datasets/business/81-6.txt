Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi

The Standards Organisation of Nigeria has met with local steel manufacturers to discuss standards in preparation for the African Continental Free Trade Agreement.

The Director General of SON, Osita Aboloma, at an emergency meeting with steel producers, said it was basically to prepare operators of the organised steel sector on the need to adhere to quality.

According to him, the organisation is currently spearheading the harmonisation of standards within Africa and the West African sub-region

He stated that Nigerian steel producers needed to take advantage of the biggest market in Africa and the world.

He said, “If you adhere to standards in Nigeria, your goods will be accepted anywhere in the world because of the AfCFTA Nigeria has signed.”
