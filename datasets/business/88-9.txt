AAAN AGM to focus on advertising challenges
The Association of Advertising Agencies of Nigeria will Friday (today) begin its 46th Annual General Meeting /Congress in Lagos.

The AGM/Congress, which was scheduled to hold in July in Asaba, Delta State, was rescheduled due to circumstances the association said were beyond its control.

A statement from the group gave the theme of this year’s AGM as ‘The war within: Solutions for survival’.

The President of the association, Mr Ikechi Odigbo, reiterated that the AAAN aimed to use the AGM as a platform to engage in intellectual and critical discourse on the challenges facing the business and practice of advertising in Nigeria and advocate unorthodox solutions in rebuilding and rebranding the industry.

The Chairman of the Events Planning Committee, Mr Doyin Adewumi, said that the association would invite its senior members to lead the discourse on the theme.

He further stated that the impact of the discourse would be beneficial to the delegates and members.

To underscore the importance of the AGM, the association added that it had invited Vice Chairman, Troyka Holdings, Mr Jimi Awosika, as the keynote speaker. Panellists would include Group CEO, X3M Ideas, Mr Steve Babaeko; the CEO, Brandzone LLC, Mrs Chizor Malize; and the CEO, BBDO, Mr Igbo Amadi-Obi.
