The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has given a new firm, DJSD Aviation Support Services, an Approved Maintenance Organisation Certificate.

The document will enable the organisation to carry out series of maintenance activities on Hawker and Boeing aircraft.

The Managing Director, DSJD, Daniel Erin, said the certificate would enable the firm to carry out maintenance on Hawker 700/800 and 900, as well as the B737-300/400/500 series airframes.

The NCAA said the certificate with registration number AMO/5N/DAS was approved “upon finding that the organisation complies in all respects with the requirements of the Civil Aviation Regulations Part 6 relating to the establishment of an Approved Maintenance Organisation and is empowered to operate an Approved Maintenance Organisation.”

Erin said there were many Hawker aircraft operating in the country’s aviation sector.

He said, “We also have a lot of the B737 in operation by scheduled operators; they are 40 or more in number.

“The DJSD Aviation Support Services will contribute to the reduction of capital flight.”

He explained that the certification process was a rigorous and meticulous exercise carried out by the regulatory agency.

“It has been an interesting thorough job done by the NCAA in making sure that all is intact,” he said.

According to him, the issuance of the certificate is a testament to the fact that the Federal Government is out to assist operators in reducing the cost of aircraft maintenance.
