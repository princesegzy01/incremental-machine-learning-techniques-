FG plans national register for the poor
Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

The Federal Government is planning to establish a national register for the poor living in Nigeria.

According to the government, the register will aid its plans of lifting millions of poor people out of poverty, as it will enable it to know the exact number of the poor in Nigeria.

The government has often stated that it plans to lift 100 million poor Nigerians out of poverty within a period of 10 years

Speaking during the commemoration of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, said a unified register for the poor would be opened soon.

She said, “We are going to have a register. We know there is one that is in existence but we are going to improve on it. Our first step is to have data because without data, we will not be able to achieve what we have set out to achieve. So, a unified social register is coming up very soon.”

Farouq said her ministry had poverty eradication as a fundamental part of its mandate and would drive the fulfilment of President Muhammadu Buhari’s vision to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.

“Under my watch, the ministry will attempt to empower every child and adult living in poverty by putting in place strategic programmes and interventions that will aid economic growth, address social needs like health, social protection and education,” she said.

Farouq added, “This is in line with the Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty in all its forms by 2030.”
