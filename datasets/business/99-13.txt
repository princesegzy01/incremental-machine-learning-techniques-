CWAY Group through its flagship brand, the 75cl bottled water, has won the 2019 edition of the African Brand Congress Merit Award in the table water category.

In a statement by the Head, Marketing and Brands, CWAY Nigeria Drinking water Science & Technical Company Limited, Paul Iraoya, the award exemplified the brand as the choice among consumers, indicating the confidence the public had in the quality of CWAY brands.

He recalled that CWAY table water won the 2018 award of World Quality Alliance as the premium table water that year, adding, “The 2019 award consolidated the position of CWAY as the market leader in drinking water category.”

CWAY said it had in the last 20 years witnessed fast-paced development and now regarded as a self-sustaining company moving towards a global enterprise, operating 16 plants across Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, India and China.

Thirteen of these plants are located in Nigeria – Lagos, Ota, Kano, Kaduna, Abuja, Benin and Port Harcourt with thousands of employees as beneficiaries of these investments in host communities, according to the firm.

In pursuant of global best practices, it said, “The company employs state-of-the-art water technology equipment sourced from the best manufacturers globally. Similarly, CWAY’s corporate skill acquisition concerns include human capital development with regular staff training programmes aimed at transferring technology from the company’s expatriate personnel to indigenous Nigerian employees.”
