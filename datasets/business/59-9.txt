The Nigerian Airspace Management Agency says it plans to install VSAT stations in 26 airports across the country to boost communication in the airspace.

The Managing Director of NAMA, Capt. Fola Akinkuotu, said the plan was in line with the agency’s resolve to eliminate blind spots in the nation’s airspace.

He said the agency last week completed the installation of a VSAT station at the Jos Airport, and successfully integrated the VHF radio into the network in that sector.

“This new installation has greatly improved the upper airways radio communication in the North-East sector to the delight of air traffic controllers and pilots alike,” Akinkuotu said.

He said under the ongoing AIS Automation project, the installation of VSAT stations had been completed in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, NAMA headquarters and Jos.
