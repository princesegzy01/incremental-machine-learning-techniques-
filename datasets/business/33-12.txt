Peter Dada, Akure

Vehicle Inspection Officers, on Tuesday asked the Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, to encourage the deployment of technology for vehicle inspection operations in the state.

The Local Organising Committee of the forthcoming National Conference of the VIO made this known during a visit to the governor.

The committee which was led by its chairman, Mr Adebayo Olusoji, said the adoption of new technology in vehicle inspection had made the operation of the VIOs more effective.

Olusoji, who stated that the committee would go round the states of the South-West, ahead of the conference, holding in Lagos State, explained that the motive of the visit to the state was to ensure and encourage states to key into the technological system of vehicle inspecting.

According to him, many states in the country were lagging behind in the use of technology.

He noted that only Lagos State and the Federal Capital Territory were already making use of the technological system.

He appealed to the Ondo State Government to deploy more personnel to the vehicle inspection office.

He said, “We want other states to emulate what we are doing in Lagos and Abuja. We don’t chase vehicles again in Lagos, we deploy technology for our work, instead of chasing vehicles.

“At the national conference we are going to showcase, to other states, how far we have gone in Lagos and Abuja. With the new technology, we achieve standard, safety and more revenue generation. “

Akeredolu urged the VIOs not to compromise the standard of their operations for the sake of the safety of the road users .
