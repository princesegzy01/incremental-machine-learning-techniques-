The joint venture partners in the 35,000 barrels per day Oil Mining Lease 25 are to evaluate the damage done on OML 25, the Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, has said.

JV partners in OML 25 include NNPC and Shell Petroleum Development Company.

NNPC’s boss recently brokered a peace deal on OML 25 between the corporation’s JV partner, Shell and Belema Oil Limited and host communities.

In a statement issued in Abuja on Sunday by the Acting Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs, NNPC, Samson Makoji, Kyari explained that the evaluation on OML 25 would enable SPDC to come up with a plan for restoring production in the oil mining lease.

The NNPC boss also disclosed that the shutdown of the facility prevented a revenue inflow of about $1.7bn through crude oil sales.

According to the statement, the NNPC boss spoke during a stakeholders’ visit to host communities and facilities of OML 25 in Kula Kingdom of Asari-Toru Local Government of Rivers State.

He said the NNPC had the mandate of the President to work with various stakeholders towards bringing lasting peace to the oil producing host communities and by extension the entire Niger Delta region.
