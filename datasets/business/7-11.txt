Moan Homes and Facility Management Limited has unveiled its Future Landlord promo to tackle accommodation problem in Lagos State.

The Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Mr Chibuzor Okonkwo, on Friday at the unveiling programme held in Lagos said it was unfortunate that many low-income earners in Lagos were homeless, while many were struggling to pay their rents.

He said, “The scheme is a lottery promo project. Over the years, we have observed that a lot of people are still not able to own at least a plot of land. Housing project has been very difficult in Nigeria unlike the developed countries where there the people can access mortgage facility with ease.

“We are taking advantage of the lottery commission to create opportunities for Nigerians to own properties in the country.

“We are starting with Lagos. From there, we will expand our scope to other states. We chose to start in Lagos because we have identified that no matter how cheap accommodation is in the state, a lot of people are still homeless.”

Okonkwo said the target of the firm was to ease the accommodation burden of artisans, market women and low-income earners.

The Administrative Manager of the firm, Mrs Nkem Anerobi, urged Nigerians to invest in real estate, saying it is a long-term investment they would not regret.

“Our mission is to provide top-reserved and strategic residential and commercial land and property for both the high and low-income earners in Nigeria with the consciousness of growing absolute reputation for integrity and total satisfaction,” she said.
