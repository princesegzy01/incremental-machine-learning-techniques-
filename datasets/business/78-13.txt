Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has said the ministry will encourage Nigerians to develop inventions that will provide solutions to problems confronting the nation.

The minister spoke when he received a mathematics inventor, Prof. Dikeoha Okwu, in Abuja on Tuesday.

Onu also spoke on the need to encourage children to develop interest in mathematics.

According to him, no nation in the history of humanity has become truly great without effective application of science, technology and innovation.

He observed that the inventions developed by Okwu were important as they would make children familiar with what they could meet in the field.

Okwu, at the event, displayed his inventions, including mathematical instruments that can be used in schools.
