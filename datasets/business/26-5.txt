The Risk Managers Society of Nigeria has proposed the engagement of risk managers in different facets of the economy and the civil service structure.

The President, RIMSON, Raymond Akalonu, said this during the 2019 national risk management conference with the theme, “Emerging risks: Rising to the challenge,” in Lagos.

He said, “RIMSON has accordingly proposed the engagement of qualified risk managers as part of the civil service structure. Apart from national infrastructure and assets, so many decision-making processes could be enhanced through effective risk management.

“Areas such as national budget planning, urban and regional planning, waste management, urban renewal, national population and immigration policy thrusts, sea level control, erosion and other ecological issues.

“National policies on education, national agric policies, monetary and fiscal policies, health and safety policies, and national security policies to mention only a few, remain critical focal points for risk based supervision and control in order to guarantee better results and national development,” he added.

The tragic incident of petrol tanker fire incident on Otedola Bridge in Lagos in 2018 and the recent Upper Iweka, Onitsha, Anambra State incidents were are sordid and avoidable, he said.

He disclosed that RIMSON made a researched submission to the Lagos State Government in respect of the Otedola Bridge incident.
