FG to establish 37 small businesses clusters
Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says the Federal Government has commenced the process of establishing clusters for small businesses in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT.

Osinbajo’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, in a statement in Abuja, said the vice president spoke on Thursday in Birnin Kebbi at the inauguration of the National Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Clinic, the 24th in the series.

Osinbajo said the gesture was in the consolidation of the efforts of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration in growing the MSMEs sector in Nigeria.

“One of the Next Level projects which we intend to do for MSMEs is what we call Shared Facilities for MSMEs.

” We plan to have 37 clusters across the nation, this will provide opportunity for MSMEs to walk into fully equipped clusters with specific facilities for end-to-end production of their products.

“So, the Federal Government has identified a minimum of one cluster per state and in Kebbi State we have the commercial fishing cluster to be commissioned in next year by over 9000 MSMEs to access daily.”

Speaking further on the resourcefulness of the Nigerian youth, the vice president said their talents and creativity were all that countries required to achieve greatness.

He said that one of the things that emerged from just going around Kebbi State and all over the country was, the evidence that there was creativity, talent and so much enterprise and people were prepared to work hard.

“Young and old, people are making their contributions to the development of the economy and that is what makes countries great.

“It is the individual work of small businesses, young entrepreneurs that make counties great all over the world,” he said.
