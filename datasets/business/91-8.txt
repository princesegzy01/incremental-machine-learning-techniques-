Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

Minister of Communications, Dr Isa Ibrahim, has directed parastatals under the ministry to attain the International Organisation for Standardisation certification for compliance with international best practices.

The minister gave the directive at an event held to celebrate the award of ISO 27001:2013 certificate to the National Information Technology Development Agency, in Abuja on Tuesday.

The award certified that NITDA had met the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system.

ISO 27001 is an information security standard, part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards, which is published by the International Organisation for Standardisation and the International Electrotechnical Commission under the joint ISO and IEC subcommittee, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27.

Organisations that meet the requirements of the standard are certified by an accredited certification body following successful completion of an audit.

The minister directed other agencies under the Ministry of Communications, including the NCC, the Nigerian Postal Service and the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited to begin the process for the certification.
