Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

The Secretary-General of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Mohammed Barkindo, has commended the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation for its ongoing reforms aimed at changing the fortunes of the corporation.

Barkindo commended the national oil firm after inspecting its pavilion at the ongoing 24th World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.

The OPEC scribe said he was glad to see the corporationâ€™s management pursue the dreams of its founding fathers despite the challenges of contraction in investment that had affected the global energy industry.
