PTAD to enrol pensioners on health insurance scheme
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The Executive Secretary, Pension Transition Directorate, Dr Chioma Ejikeme, has said that the directorate is working on how it will enrol pensioners on the National Health Insurance Scheme.

She dropped the hint on Tuesday while speaking in Lokoja at the North-East verification of government parastatals’ pensioners under the defined benefit scheme.

She said that the directorate had commenced the process and was convinced that pensioners would be enjoying the benefits soon.

She said that the directorate was taking the step because as pensioners advanced in age, they would face certain health challenges requiring timely interventions.

“We are taking into consideration the fact that as pensioners get older in age, they usually face health challenges and enrolling them on the scheme will help in reducing their suffering,” Ejikeme said.

Ejikeme also warned the pensioners to beware of an ongoing scam when fraudsters would call them and promise to help in resolving their pension issues and asking for payments in advance.

The executive secretary said no PTAD employees would “under any circumstances ask anyone for money before rendering any service.”
