Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja

The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, has said that the Federal Government is targeting to grow the economy through non-oil exports.

The minister said this while making a presentation at the Nigeria Investment Showcase, Guildhall, London, on Thursday.

A statement signed by the minister’s Special Assistant on Media, Mr Julius Toba-Jegede, quoted him as saying that a lot of initiatives were being implemented to achieve the government’s objective to boost non-oil export.

He gave some of these initiatives to include the development of six special economic zones; establishment of several agro-processing zones and the development of a national trading platform.

He said, “Our new national ethos envisages a Nigeria that is export-oriented, high producing, high growth and offers productive infrastructure for businesses large and small.

“It is ambitious and sets out to achieve transformational economic growth, by leveraging our demographic dividends and comparative advantage in mineral deposits and agriculture, to provide an opportunity for long-term oriented investors.

“These pipelines of investment opportunities include but are not limited to the development of six special zones, the establishment of several agro-processing zones and the development of a national trading platform.”
