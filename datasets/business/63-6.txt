The United Nations Development Programme and the Global Environment Facility has recommended the bio-control substance, Aflasafe, for use by farmers of maize and groundnut to reduce the effect of the fungi infection on export and the health of Nigerians.

Aflasafe is an anti-toxic fungi infection product developed by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture to tackle poisonous toxins produced by fungi.

The bio-control substance was promoted for use at a three-day training organised by the UNDP and GEF on Good Agricultural Practices for maize and groundnuts production and family nutrition, for extension workers from Gombe and Adamawa.

Speaking at the event, Mr Zakariya Iliya of Harvestfield Industries, noted that the dreams of many exporters of the grains had been crushed due to the traces of Aflatoxin found in the grains after being exported.

According to Iliya, as a result of the effect of the fungi infection on export and the health of the people, the IITA developed the Aflasafe product to control the toxin in maize and groundnuts, adding that it was introduced to produce high quality and cost-effective bio-control way of tackling Aflatoxin.
