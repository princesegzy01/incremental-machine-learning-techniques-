The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has engaged Russian firms and the state company to rehabilitate Nigeria’s four refineries.

The NNPC’s Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, who disclosed this in a message he retweeted on Wednesday, also stated that gas infrastructure development was being discussed with the Russian investors.

He stated that a team involving the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva; the NNPC’s Chief Financial Officer, Umar Ajiya; the NNPC’s Chief Operating Officer, Refineries, Mustapha Yakubu; among others, engaged the investors at the ongoing Russia, Africa Economic Forum in Sochi, Russia.

“The team engaged Russian state company and private entities to secure development cooperation of mutual benefit,” Kyari retweeted.

He added, “Refinery rehabilitation and gas infrastructure development on the front burner.”

Nigeria’s four refineries had over the years been performing abysmally, as they continue to fail to meet up to 50 per cent of their capacity utilisation.
