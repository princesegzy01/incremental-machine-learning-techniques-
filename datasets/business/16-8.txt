Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday in Abuja said Nigeria remained a major trading partner of Canada.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Osinbajo said this at the Nigeria-Canada Investment Summit 2019 with the theme, ‘Reaching Greater Heights.’

The vice president said Nigeria was one of the 10 reforming economies in the world, adding that the summit focused on the six major sectors of the country’s economy.

“The six sectors listed in the summit namely: education, healthcare, mining, power, infrastructure and agriculture, are the crucial sectors and are very important for the Nigerian economy.

“We encourage all our partners to maximise all the platforms provided and prospects available for businesses to prosper. Our trade and investment sector in Nigeria has remained a major trading partner to Canada in Africa.

“Canada imports consist of minerals, fuel, cocoa, rubber and many more while it exports vehicles equipment, manufacturing equipment and software.”

The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, said, “Nigeria in particular ranks among Canada’s top three trading partners in Africa with an estimated import and export receipt of $377m, $360m worth of goods, respectively.”
