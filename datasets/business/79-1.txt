MDAs not patronising us, says NASENI
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

The National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure has said it is not being patronised by the Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government despite President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s Executive Order 5.

Executive Vice Chairman of NASENI, Prof. Mohammed Haruna, said on Tuesday that the Executive Order 5 had not translated into better patronage for the agency from the MDAs.

Executive Order 5 stipulates that Federal Government establishments are to give preference to Nigerian professionals in the award of contracts for products and services.

Speaking at the Abuja International Trade, Haruna observed that NASENI had not been receiving adequate patronage from institutions of government.
