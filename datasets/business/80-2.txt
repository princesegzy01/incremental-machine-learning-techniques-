Anna Okon

Training institution, Dale Carnegie, is set to host Chief Executive Officers, senior leaders, human resources directors, managers and other key organisational leaders in a one-day conference aimed at improving engagement, happiness and productivity in the workplace.

According to a statement from the organisers, the conference with the theme ‘Building the workplace of our dreams’ is scheduled to hold in Lagos in October and will offer organisations innovative ideas on how to build a workplace where people feel happy, engaged and empowered to give their very best.

The statement issued by the Country Director, Dale Carnegie Training, Patrick Nwakogo, indicated that the company was bringing its over 100 years’ experience in over 90 countries to the conference.

Nwakogo said the speakers and discussants, who were carefully selected for their expertise and experience in the area under discuss, would share ideas on how to create work environments that enable people to unleash their full potential, stimulate growth and success for their organisations in particular and the economy in general.

He added that currently, only 20 per cent of the workforce was unleashing its full potential while the rest were intentionally withholding their best efforts, doing just enough to retain their jobs, adding that this was a loss for everyone.

According to the statement, the conference, which is designed to be an annual event, is part of activities to mark Dale Carnegie’s sixth year anniversary in Nigeria.
