Discos now taking less power than requested — TCN
Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

Power distribution companies are now taking less quantum of electricity than what they requested, the Transmission Company of Nigeria announced on Thursday.

TCN also faulted claims made by Discos when the distributors claimed that they were not rejecting electricity load allocated to them by the transmission company.

Documents made available to our correspondent by the transmission company in Abuja on power nominations made by Discos and what the distributors eventually collected showed that the Discos took less than what they requested for.

In the document, TCN stated that on August 22, for instance, Kano Disco nominated to take 310.60 megawatts of power, while the Multi Year Tariff Order allocation to Kano Disco was 359.38MW.

TCN said, “It is important to clarify that MYTO allocation is a percentage of electricity on the grid that is made available to all the Discos.

“Discos day ahead nomination is what the Discos say they can off-take out of the MYTO allocation for the next day, while actual consumption is what they eventually take from the available MYTO allocation at the TCN/Disco interface points.

“For Kano Disco, even though it nominated to take 310.60MW, it was able to actually off-take only 154.17MW, leaving a total of 205.21MW representing 57.1 per cent of MYTO allocation to it unutilised.”
