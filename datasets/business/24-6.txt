Institute urges FG to establish planning commission
The Nigerian Institute of Town Planners has called on the Federal Government to establish a national planning commission to address the issue of urban and regional development across the country.

The National President of the NITP, Mr Ezutah Ezutah, made the call while addressing journalists in Abuja, ahead of the forthcoming 2019 edition of the national conference of the institute and its 50th anniversary scheduled to hold in Ibadan with the theme: ‘Regenerating Nigerian Cities for Sustainable Development’.

According to him, in Nigeria, there is provision in the law for the establishment of the National Planning Commission at the federal level since 1992, adding that the act has not been established.

He said that the conference was intended to address environmental problems militating against functional and efficient city systems and to call the attention of all stakeholders and proffer enduring solutions.

Ezutah said, “We will use the conference to appeal to our members in the Senate and House of Representatives to use their offices to ensure the implementation of the Nigerian Urban and Regional Planning Act.

“The programme will be used to encourage members to ensure the use of basic principles of the profession to achieve excellence. The urban regeneration has become a key focus among built environment professionals in developing countries.”

He said when created the national planning commission would support in the formulation of the national policies for urban and regional planning; initiate, prepare and implement national physical development plan, regional and subject plans as well as establish and maintain urban and regional planning standard.
