President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed the National Auditor of the All Progressives Congress, George Muoghalu, as the new Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority.

Muoghalu’s appointment is coming one month after Buhari named the immediate past NIWA MD, Senator Olorunibe Mamora, as the Minister of State for Health.

Muoghalu is also the fourth MD of NIWA in the past seven years.

The Chairman of the Anambra State chapter of the Civil Liberties Organisation, Vincent Ezekwueme, hailed Buhari for the appointment.

According to a CLO’s statement, Ezekwueme described the appointment as the best Independence Day gift to the South-East.

“This is a welcome development and cheering news to the people of the South-East and Nigerians. This is the best Independence Day gift to the South-East. The President has provided the opportunity towards resuscitation of the moribund Onitsha seaport,” the statement read in part.

The statement also called on Moghalu to live up to the expectation of the President and Nigerians by being committed in the discharge of his assignments.

“Moghalu as a moralist, selfless, patriotic, humble, honest and servant leader must bear the interest and social well-being of the citizens at heart by rehabilitating the decrepit and deplorable Onitsha seaport to boost economic activities in the South-East, as well as give them a sense of belonging,” he said.

Between year 2013 and now, NIWA has had Mrs Mariam Ciroma, Boss Mustapha, and Mamora as substantive chief executive officers, while Danladi Ibrahim, a senior director at the agency had performed the role of acting MD.
