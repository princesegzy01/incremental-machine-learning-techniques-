47 million Nigerians don’t have access to toilets — Minister
Sunday Aborisade, Abuja

The Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, has said that Nigeria leads other nations in terms of poor hygiene with about 47 million citizens not having direct access to toilets.

Adamu, who appeared before the Senate Committee on Water Resources to defend the 2020 budget of his ministry on Monday, said only inhabitants of 14 out of the 774 local government areas in the country were not practising open defecation.

Adamu said, “Nigeria is the second largest country in the world where we practise open defecation. 47 million people practise open defecation in this country. They don’t use toilets because they don’t even have provision for toilets in their homes.

“This is not dignifying. It is not good for women. Girls no longer want to go to school whenever they are experiencing their monthly flow because there are no water sanitation facilities in most schools.”
