Samuel Awoyinfa

As part of activities marking the 2019 Global Sustainability Week, employees of the pan-African conglomerate, the Dangote Group, on Thursday flagged off a Waste-to-Wealth initiative to create a sustainable environment.

A statement from the company also indicated it would generate revenues from environmental waste, and also give back to the host communities.

It added that the company marked the week with the theme, ‘Our community, our passion’ with various activities held in the Lagos Head Office and across the plants and business units.

These activities, it said, focused on investment programmes directed towards turning waste to wealth, and reviving reading culture in young children in host communities.

The Dangote Group said the employees took the initiative to St. George Primary School and Aunty Ayo International School in Ikoyi, Lagos.
