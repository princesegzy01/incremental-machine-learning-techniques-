Sixt expands to haulage, driving academy
Coscharis Mobility Limited, a member of the Coscharis Group and franchisee of Sixt Rentals in Nigeria, says it is expanding into heavy duty haulage.

The firm said it planned to roll out 50 Ford trucks preparatory to a formal inauguration next year.

It added that as part of its expansion drive, it also planned to open a mobility driving academy.

At the firmâ€™s sixth anniversary celebration recently, the Managing Director of Coscharis Mobility Limited, Mr Christian Chigbundu, said the firm had since 2014 turned challenges in the environment into opportunities.

He said the strategy had enabled it to deliver value for money.

According to Chigbundu, the footprints of the firm in the past six years includes short and medium-term car rental service; long term car rental; short and long-term leases; fleet management and consulting; haulage and supply chain management; and outsourcing and human resources consulting.

He said some corporate customers in the industry had already keyed into the haulage project as a way of phasing out their old fleet of trucks.

He disclosed that the Sixt network had also been expanded with offices in Port Harcourt, Abuja, Uyo, Enugu and Kano, with plans to open more in 2020.Ojikutu said the government must also revalue its investment in the industry before establishing a national carrier, adding that this would help the country to compete with its contemporaries globally.
