The Chairman, NBCCâ€™s Presidential Inauguration Dinner Committee, Mr Olufemi Olubanwo, said the committee would showcase the chamber as the foremost bilateral chamber in Nigeria, diligently striving to deepen Anglo-Nigerian trade and investment.

According to a statement, during the forthcoming dinner, the NBCC will inaugurate Mr Kayode Falowo as its 16th president, and decorate the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu as a patron of the chamber.
