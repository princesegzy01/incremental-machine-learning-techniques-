Ogun remains number one destination for investors â€“Abiodun
The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has said that Ogun State remains the first choice for investors in the country, saying that his administration was consciously working towards retaining that status.

Dapo added that the state with its rich human and natural endowment could not be compared with any other state in terms of access to land, seaport and availability of arable land.

According to a statement issued by the state government on Wednesday, Abiodun stated this at the 34th Annual General Meeting of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria.

The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Noimot Salako Oyedele, urged foreign investors to take advantage of the one-stop arrangement created by the recently passed Ogun State Investment Promotion Law.
