The Housing Development Advocacy Network has expressed concern over the recent World Bank’s ease of doing business rankings which rated Nigeria poorly in the ease of registering property.

The group said the government, members of the National Assembly, state governors and other stakeholders should look into the problem of property and title registration which had been a major problem for many years.

According to the group, the challenge of property registration contributes to the poor performance of the country’s housing, mortgage and construction sectors.

The group noted that property registration and titling had been one of the areas of concern in the country’s housing sector.

It explained that the report confirmed the fears about the ease of doing business in the housing sector which had made its growth stagnant.

“If the bureaucratic bottlenecks associated with property and title registration are reduced, it will significantly attract more investors and establish a process that will create mass affordable housing for Nigerians who need them most,” the group said.

The World Bank in its report placed Nigeria in 183rd, far below its African peers such as Ghana and South Africa and ranked above only seven countries out of the 190 surveyed.
