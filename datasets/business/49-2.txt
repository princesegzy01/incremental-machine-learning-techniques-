The Benin Electricity Distribution Company Plc says it will roll out 572,392 meters in the next two years across its franchise areas covering Edo, Delta, Ondo and Ekiti states under the Meter Asset Provider scheme.

This was contained in a statement made available to our correspondent in Lagos on Sunday.

The breakdown, according to the statement, shows that Edo State will have 190,000 meters; Delta, 200,200 meters; Ekiti, 67,452 meters; and Ondo, 114740 meters.

The Executive Director, Commercial, Mr Abu Ejoor, said to kick-start the scheme, it would initially take up to three months and it would eventually pick up with expected increase in monthly rate across its franchise areas.

Ejoor said that in Edo State, the scheme would commence in two major locations, which he gave as GRA to Ihama in Benin City and Okpela in Auchi North.

He urged the customers to cooperate with enumerators going round various locations and should respond promptly to request for completion of their enumeration forms.
