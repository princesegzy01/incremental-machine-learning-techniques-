Buy Nigeria-made goods –CBN
Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt

THE Central Bank of Nigeria on Monday called on Nigerians to patronise home-made goods in order to contribute to the growth of the nation’s economy.

The CBN also said that consuming only foreign goods would only help in developing the countries where such goods were manufactured to the detriment of Nigeria’s economic growth.

Director of Communications of the CBN, Isaac Okorafor, made this call during the CBN fair organised in Port Harcourt with its theme as ‘Promoting Financial Stability and Economic Development’.

Okoroafor urged those condemning Federal Government’s closure of the borders to have a rethink, adding that the decision was in the best interest of the nation.

He explained that no country would develop by only presenting papers on podiums and at the same time relying on foreign goods without producing locally.
