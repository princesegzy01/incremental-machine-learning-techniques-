The Federal Government, through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, had signed an agreement to end gas flaring in the Niger Delta region.

The decision was taken following the consideration of a motion by Senator Betty Apiafi on “The need to monitor the Nigerian Flare Commercialization Programme towards ending Gas Flaring by 2020.”

The Senate also mandated the panel to immediately review and recommend upwards penalty for defaulters of Nigeria’s Gas flaring laws.

It also urged the Federal Government to intensify efforts to diversify from crude oil to natural gas production.

Apiafi had drawn the attention of the Senate to laws against flaring of associated natural gas in Nigeria.

She lamented the manner in which such laws were being disregarded by International oil companies operating in Nigeria.

She said the action of the IOCs has made Nigeria lose huge financial resources while residents of the region are now at great risk of contracting ailments.
