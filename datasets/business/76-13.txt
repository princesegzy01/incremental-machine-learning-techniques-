French energy major, Total, will make a Final Investment Decision on a Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas project by the end of the year and expects first LNG by 2023, the company’s Head of Production, Arnaud Breuillac, has said.

Early this month, The PUNCH reported that the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas named the SCD Group as preferred bidder to construct the $10bn NLNG Train 7 project.

SCD Group is a joint venture consortium, comprising Saipem, Chiyoda and Daewoo. SCD JV consortium would be undertaking the engineering, procurement and construction project for the Train 7.

Breuillac, in a report by Reuters on Wednesday, said the expansion in Nigeria would add seven million tonnes per year to an existing 22 million tonnes per year plant.

He spoke in New York during the company’s Investor Day, stressing that the group aimed to grow the share of gas output to 22 per cent of its portfolio by 2025 from 14 per cent in 2018.
