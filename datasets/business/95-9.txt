The Minister of Power, Mr Sale Mamman, says the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari will deliver uninterrupted power supply to Nigerians before the end of its tenure.

Mamman said the completion of all major power projects in the country would bring about stable and quality electricity supply.

He gave the assurance after the inspection of the 215-megawatts Kaduna Power Plant, 132/33KV Kudenda Substation and Mando transmission line in Kaduna on Friday, according to a statement on Sunday.

Mamman, who was in company with the Minister of State, Mr Goddy Agba, said aside from increasing generation capacity, the Kudenda Substation would provide voltage support to Kaduna, Kano and Jos and improve the quality of electricity distributed to the public.

He expressed satisfaction with the level and quality of work done on the projects but warned contractors against any delay in the completion of the projects.
