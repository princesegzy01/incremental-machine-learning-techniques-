HND/degree division: Court okays ARCON, aggrieved membersâ€™ settlement
Peter Dada, Akure

The dichotomy in the membership registration of the Architects Registration Council of Nigeria has been resolved as the Federal High Court has granted the council and its aggrieved members the permission to settle the matter out of court.

Some members of the council, possessing the Higher National Diploma certificates, had approached the court to challenge what they called alleged marginalisation by the leadership of ARCON.

They accused the council of denying them the membership registration.

It was gathered that the leadership of the council, under leadership of Architech Dipo Ajayi, had allegedly directed that any member who did not possess a university degree would not be registered as a full-fledged member.

At the Federal High Court, sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Tuesday, the counsels for both parties agreed to discontinue the case and settle the matter amicably.

The judge, Justice Abdul Dogo, in his ruling, agreed with the counsels that the case be settled out of court, after listening to their terms of settlement.

In a reaction, the counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Yinka Agboola, noted that the agreement was reached after a series of meetings between the aggrieved members and the leadership of the council.

One of the aggrieved members, Dr Oloruntoba Kayode, expressed the belief that the leadership of ARCON would soon honour its part of the agreement in the best interest of all.
