A new online platform has been unveiled for the benefit of content creators who wish to make income from educational videos.

The platform, Trainquarters, provides a platform for video trainers to sign onto a customised website, upload their online courses and get paid for the videos.

Speaking during the inauguration of the platform in Lagos recently, the Founder, Trainquarters, Stephanie Obi, said the platform would greatly assist Nigerians to take advantage of the $197bn global online training market.

The graduate of computer science who said the platform was inspired by her personal experience of witnessing challenge during her attempt to organise online courses, said the platform was tailored to fit people who experienced the same challenge of launching their online courses, keeping them secure and getting payment for them.

She said Trainquarters was an all-in-one platform that made it easy for Africans to create and sell online courses.

Explaining the way the platform works, she said, “As soon as you have an account, there is already a website customised for you, all you need to do is put your name.

“There is also already a school built, you just need to start selling your course.”

She explained that in Nigeria, it was difficult to create and sell knowledge because of the infrastructural challenge.

She said, “There is a huge education gap in Nigeria. The education system does not prepare people for real life. We hope that the platform will lead to more training programmes in Africa.”
