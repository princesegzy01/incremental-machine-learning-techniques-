The Delta Air Lines Foundation says it has made a multi-million dollar commitment to an international advocacy organisation, Global Citizen’s Global Goal Live, for a year-long campaign to mobilise resources to end extreme poverty.

The foundation said the advocacy would also help to address climate change and reduce inequality by 2030 as outlined by the 2015 United Nations Global Goals.

Delta’s Chief Executive Officer, Rd Bastian, said the commitment to the Global Citizen movement was born out of the determination to make the world better and more connected.

“We’re looking forward to the opportunity to be part of this remarkable effort to end extreme poverty and improve the world around us,” he said.

Bastian, according to the group, will co-chair Global Citizen’s private sector CEO Coalition, which also includes CEO Chuck Robbins of Cisco, Hans Vestberg of Verizon, Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson and Chief Marketing Officer Marc Prichard of P&G.

The foundation said its partnership with Global Citizen illustrated its commitment to connecting the world while making it better through environmental stewardship, diversity and inclusion, and community development.

“Delta and Global Citizen will join forces to activate the leading voices on the world’s most significant social and economic challenges while climbing towards a more sustainable future,” it added.
