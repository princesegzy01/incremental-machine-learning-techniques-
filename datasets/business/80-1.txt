The management of EgyptAir says as a way of identifying with Nigeria’s 59th independence anniversary, it will give passengers discount on fares.

The airline’s Country Manager, Mr Muharram Abdulrahman, said EgptAir would offer its Nigerian customers 50 per cent discount on business class for tickets issued between September 30 and October 7, 2019.

He said the discount would be between Cairo and most of the airline’s international destinations.

“This is in line with the carrier’s plan to provide the optimum service for the best and competitive fares,” he added.

The airline said it had also extended its codeshare with United Airlines in an effort to expand its network in North America.

“Subject to the agreement, EgypAir customers can now book their flights to Boston, San Francesco, Los Angeles and Chicago through Washington, starting from September 12. EgyptAir is keen on expanding its network in North America especially after inaugurating the new non-stop service to Washington in June, providing integration for EgyptAir network,” the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the airline, Capt. Ahmed Adel, said in a statement.

The airline noted that customers could fly to the new destinations through Cairo to Washington on its newest Dreamliner B787-9 equipped with full flatbed seats in business class and personal screen in all classes.
