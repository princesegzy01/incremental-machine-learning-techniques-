An Owerri-bound Air Peace flight from the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, on Tuesday morning made an air return over engine failure.

The aircraft, which departed the airport at 07.35am with 90 passengers and six crew members on board, returned at 8.06 am.

The Corporate Communications Executive, Air Peace, Stanley Olisa, said the aircraft was already airborne when the pilot noticed a change in the parameter of one of the engines and aborted the flight.

“He reported the incident; took precautionary measure and returned to base in line with Air Peace safety operational procedures,” Olisa said.

The Accident Investigation Bureau said it had been notified of the incident which involved a Boeing 737-500 aircraft with registration number 5N-BUJ, adding that it had commenced investigation.

The General Manager, Public Affairs of the AIB, Mr Tunji Oketunbi, said from the information provided by the Air Traffic Control, the flight crew declared engine failure at 07:47 local time and subsequently made an air return to Lagos.
