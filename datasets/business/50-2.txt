Royal Exchange Plc says its gross written premium rose by 15 per cent in 2018 to N14.7bn from N12.8bn in 2017.

The Chairman, Royal Exchange Plc, Mr Kenny Odogwu, disclosed this during the company’s annual general meeting in Lagos.

A breakdown of the figure revealed that the net premium income for the period amounted to N9.1bn which was a 29.7 per cent growth over the 2018 figure; while net underwriting profit amounted to N9.73bn in the financial year under review.

Underwriting profit went up to N3.67bn in 2018 from N1.05bn in 2017, while net income stood at N4.35bn, from N2.4bn in 2017.

A further analysis of the operating results showed that the total assets of the group witnessed a growth of 6.74per cent, from N33.2bn in 2017 to N35.53bn as at December 31, 2018.

Net claims paid for the period under review amounted to N3.1bn, an eight per cent marginal reduction from the 2017 figure of N3.42bn.

The chairman noted that despite the harsh operating environment, the group was able to deliver a better result in 2018 against the previous years.

He said this was achieved through cost optimisation initiatives, innovation in key categories and extensive retail market expansion as well as by participating in large-ticket financial transactions.

Odogwu said, “Royal Exchange Plc envisions a situation where the retail insurance market should be able to contribute between 50-60 per cent of our revenues in the future, as the retail market is the future of insurance in Nigeria, considering the population of the country.”

He stated that with the recent approval from the National Insurance Commission to undertake agricultural insurance, the company had entered into strategic alliances with various stakeholders in the agricultural space to drive insurance with that sector of the economy and in the couple of months, revenues would start coming in from there.

He said, “Royal Exchange Plc will in the years to come, continue to be an aggressive player in the retail market in Nigeria and will be looking at different strategies to increase its product offering and visibility in the marketplace, while not losing track of the corporate market, where the returns and margins, are getting thinner, yearly.”.
