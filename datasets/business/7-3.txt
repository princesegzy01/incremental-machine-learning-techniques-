The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority says a new platform has been created for pilots and airline operators to report incidents of birds or wildlife strike on an aircraft.

The NCAA stated that the International Civil Aviation Organisation evolved the new format known as the European Coordinating Centre for Accidents and Incidents Reporting System.

According to the regulatory agency, the ECCAIRS is an excel-based format and will now be used for ICAO bird strike information system reporting.

The General Manager, Public Relations of the NCAA, Mr Sam Adurogboye, said on Sunday that airlines had been notified in a circular.

“This notification was contained in an advisory circular with reference NCAA/AAS./BHC/04/006/11/132 dated July 30, 2019 to all airports/airline operators, pilots and aircraft engineers,” he said.

Adurogboye stated that in view of the development and in accordance with the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig. CARs) 2015, Part 12.6.23.2 and Aerodrome Standards Manual, Section 13.2.4.2, it had become mandatory for airlines to follow the process.
