Telecommunications operators have condemned the proposed nine per cent communications service tax the 9th National Assembly plans to re-introduce.

The operators under the aegis of the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria said the 8th National Assembly which earlier considered introducing the tax in 2016 had shelved the idea after the intervention of the association.

Also, network operators belonging to the Association Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria said the proposed nine per cent tax would make life difficult for an average Nigerian as communication is presently the most affordable basic need of everyone.

The President of ATCON, Olusola Teniola, noted in a statement on Thursday that ATCON executives met the former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on November 8, 2016 where the senators acknowledged that the growth of ICT was critical to the creation of jobs and reduction in youth unemployment.

The ATCON president noted that the association suggested that the tax base be widened to allow more businesses to pay taxes.
