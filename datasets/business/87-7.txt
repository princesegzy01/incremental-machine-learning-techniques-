The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association has rewarded mattress and bedding products manufacturer, Mouka, with a brand new ambulance for safe work environment.

NECA rewarded the mattress manufacturer with a Peugeot ambulance, which it said was based on the outcome of its 2018 Occupational Safety and Health audit exercise. It described the company’s efforts at maintaining safe workplace as exceptional.

A statement added, “The award is the result of NECA’s partnership with the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund geared towards executing the Safe Workplace Intervention Project. This is designed to ensure the effective implementation of the Employees’ Compensation Act 2010 being implemented by the NSITF through intervention programmes that would make the workplace safer for employees.”

The audit was said to have been conducted in March 2018 and its results made available in 2019.

The audit is an initiative under the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment which saw the Kaduna Plant of Mouka Foam emerge winner for its exceptional performance in the OSH management systems.

The Chief Operating Officer Mouka, Mr Femi Fapohunda, while congratulating Mouka’s Kaduna Plant team, reiterated the company’s safety slogan “safety first, safety always.”

He emphasised that this should remain the watchword and practice of all Mouka workers nationwide.
