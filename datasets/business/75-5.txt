Hollandia unveils new pack design
Hollandia Evap Milk, one of Nigeria’s evaporated milk brands, says it has unveiled a new attractive pack design in order to connect with evolving consumers.

The new packaging, it adds, shows the nutritious benefits of the milk as well as other striking features to connect with consumers.

The statement read in part, “Evident in the new pack design are the brand’s royal blue background, signifying its modern and trendy values, and its gold logo, depicting its premium positioning.

“The vibrant rising sun symbolises a new beginning and the breakfast occasion which the brand is associated with.”

According to Chi Limited’s Managing Director, Mr Deepanjan Roy, consumers familiar with the old brand pack design can be assured of the same great taste, quality and numerous nutritional benefits of their favourite milk as it transits to a trendier pack design.

“The new pack design was done to connect evolving active consumer lifestyle and the benefits of Hollandia Evap Milk. Hollandia Evap Milk is an all-rounder, for consumers desirous of a daily healthy boost of mental, physical energy for an active day,” he stated.
