First Bank of Nigeria Limited says there is a need for more attention and support to be given to the Nigerian textile industry and the manufacturing sector.

The bank said as part of efforts to promote the country, it set aside October 2 for its workers to wear locally- made textile attire adorned in the bank’s 125th anniversary logo.

It stated that this was in commemoration of the 59th independence anniversary of Nigeria and to portray the bank’s impact across the country, in line with its 125th anniversary themed ‘Woven into the fabric of society.’

A statement from the bank said, “The blue coloured material designed with a combination of the bank’s iconic 125th anniversary logo; meshed with the elephant head in the yellow gold dynamic shape;

“The figure 125 written in the dreamer font with the number ‘5’chipped out of an elephant tusk; the weaving needle; the embroidered fabrics from different cultures – Yoruba Adire, Tiv Lishi, Ghana Kente, the Scottish kilt.

“The vibrant colours of the logo represent the nations, peoples and the diversity we foster.”

It stated that the native attire fashion was part of its trust in the diverse opportunities the textile industry provided, and its contribution to national growth and development.

The bank said the job opportunities, youth and women empowerment, entrepreneurship could not be over emphasised.
