Russia targets Africa to broaden energy influence
Russia is looking to increase energy cooperation with African countries as it strives to play a more influential role in global energy markets.

Africa is already a major producer of key commodities, but with its population and economies growing steadily, the continent is also emerging as a major demand hub.

President Vladimir Putin is hosting the Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi this week.

S&P Global Platts quoted analysts as saying an increase in dialogue could translate into new deals in oil and gas exploration and production, LNG and oil trading, as well as nuclear power.

Indigo Ellis, head of Africa at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said African governments would welcome Russia’s renewed interest as they “are slowly waking to the realities of China’s murky lending, and long aware of the West’s conditional, and ever scarcer loans.”

“Russia offers ‘no strings attached’ investment for African countries that seem to be a win-win for both parties,” Ellis said, adding that she expected trade agreements and partnerships for energy, mining and defence to emerge from Sochi.

“While defence contracts have so far been Russia’s primary modus operandi in engaging with African governments, Russia will curry favour across Africa through more energy deals.”

“Moscow will try to make as much as hay as possible about its growing investments in the region at the Russia-Africa summit.”
