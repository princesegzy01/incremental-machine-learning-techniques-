Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

Transaction advisers for the establishment of the country’s national carrier, Nigeria Air, have concluded their studies and met with the Federal Government to submit their findings.

According to the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, the plan to establish a national carrier for Nigeria was still being pursued vigorously.

Sirika said these in his office in Abuja on Thursday while playing host to executive officers of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.

He also stated that there had been budgetary provision for the construction of a second runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.

The minister said, “Regarding the second runway (for Abuja airport) and national carrier, it is becoming practically the major questions that everyone asks me whenever they see me.

“Every Nigerian is asking for the national carrier and every professional is asking for the second runway.

“Well, to tell you, the second runway project is in the budget and it will be procured by God’s grace.

“The national carrier is in the pipeline and in the next one hour I will be meeting with the transaction advisers.

“They are in town and they have concluded their baseline studies and we are moving to the next stage. So that is also on course.”

Responding to requests for an upgrade of communication systems at control towers across airports in Nigeria, the minister told his guests that the government was doing a lot in that regard.

He also called on airlines to also improve their communications systems in order to function effectively with the gadgets being installed at airports.
