Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi

The office of the Auditor-General for Local Governments in Lagos State is set to embark on state-wide project inspection in all the 20 local government areas and 37 local council development areas.

Specific attention would be paid to completed and ongoing projects executed by the local governments and local council development areas between January and December 2018, the office said.

A statement, signed by Mrs Adesumbo Abolarin for the office of the Permanent Secretary and Auditor-General for Local Governments, stated that this yearâ€™s exercise would commence on October 10 and end October 25.

Abolarin said in order to ensure a hitch-free exercise, professionally qualified and knowledgeable engineers in diverse fields from the Ministry of Works and Infrastructure, Ministry of Transportation, New Towns Development Authority and Lagos State Development Property Corporation had been co-opted to strengthen the audit team with requisite technical competence.

She said the audit report would provide effective parameters for assessing the performance of local government administrators.

According to her, reports of past editions were widely accepted and therefore the report of this edition will not depart from laid down standards to achieve the goal of the exercise.

Abolarin said the outcome of the inspection would be published and circulated widely, and enjoined personnel to cooperate with the inspection teams towards timely completion of the assignment.
