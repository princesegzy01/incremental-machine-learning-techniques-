A domestic carrier, Air Peace, has been named the company of the year at the 2019 Business Hallmark People of the Year Awards.

In a statement, the airline said its Chief of Finance and Administration, Mrs Ejiroghene Eghagha, received the award on behalf of Air Peace.

While receiving the award, Eghagha was quoted as saying that it was a great delight to know that Air Peace was being recognised as the company of the year.

“It gladdens me and, of course, the entire team to know that Air Peace, West Africa’s largest carrier, is being recognised today as an airline that has significantly contributed to the growth of Nigeria’s aviation industry,” she added.

Eghagha said the five-year journey of the airline had not been devoid of challenges but added that collective determination and visionary leadership had kept the organisation soaring to the top and achieving more firsts.

She added that the airline would continue to blaze the trail in the provision of safe and best-in-class flight services to all its customers.

The award, which was organised by the Hallmark Newspaper Group in Lagos, was presented by the Chairman of the event, Professor Anya O. Anya, with the support of Chief Marc Wabara and Mrs Priscilla Oti.
