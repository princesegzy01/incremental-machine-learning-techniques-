Only law-abiding freight forwarders can practise – Amaechi
Anna Okon

The Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, has said freight forwarders who do not follow the established processes as stated by law will not be allowed to operate in Nigeria.

He enjoined all freight forwarders to take advantage of the certification process put in place by the Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria to become professionally fit and competent by obtaining the international diploma in Freight Forwarding and Supply Chain Management.

Amaechi, whose ministry supervises the CRFFN, gave the indication in Lagos during a sensitisation workshop organised by the CRFFN and the ADG International Resources, tagged, ‘Freight forwarding as a career’. He said, “Only those who obey the law will be allowed to operate, and getting certified will be the first step towards implementing the CRFFN law. Those who have refused to function within the law will be compelled to do so.

“Professionalising freight forwarding will no doubt improve the ease of doing business ratings and reduce smuggling activities which is dangerous and inimical to the country’s economy. Any educated and enlightened freight forwarder will always find the space to fit in.”
