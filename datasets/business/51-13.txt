The baggage cabin of a Royal Air Maroc flight was on Friday found open after the aircraft landed at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos.

The opened cabin was said to have been discovered by aviation security operatives at the airport.

The General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, who confirmed the development, said investigation had commenced into the incident.

She stated that the flight with registration number CN – ROR landed at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport at about 0404hours on Friday, October 11, 2019 with its baggage cabin door opened.

According to Yakubu, confirming the incident, aviation security officials that escorted the aircraft upon landing noted that all necessary security landing procedures were observed as the aircraft was landing.

She explained that there were no invaders around the aircraft, adding that the security personnel suspected that the opening must have been as a result of force landing.

“Further investigation revealed that all passengers on the flight got their luggage intact, except for a certain Tazi Larbi, whose luggage with tag number 829116 did not come on the flight because it was left in Morocco. Appropriate agencies have, however, commenced investigation into the incident to ascertain the cause,” Yakubu said.

She stated that despite the incident, the aircraft pushed back at about 0530 hours and was airborne to Morocco at 0540 hours.

The airline has, however, not made any comment on the incident.
