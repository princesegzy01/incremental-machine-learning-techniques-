Group may sue oil firms for gas flaring
Patrick Odey, Uyo

A group, Network Advancement Programme for Poverty and Disaster Risk Reduction, says it has concluded plans to drag ExxonMobil and

Frontiers Oil to court over alleged flaring gas and causing spillage.

President of the group, Alhaji Al-Mustapher Edoho, said this on Saturday while briefing newsmen in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.

He explained that the action became necessary after its petition to the companies for records of mitigation fell on deaf ears.

Edoho said, “We petitioned the oil firms demanding records of mitigation system to cushion the effects of gas flaring, oil spills and other environmental effects and what we got as responses are not satisfactory to us.”

He blamed government for being insensitive to the plights of the people of the oil bearing communities of Onna, Ibeno, Eket and Esit.
