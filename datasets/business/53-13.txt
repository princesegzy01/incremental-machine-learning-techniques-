Ogun targets increased cocoa exports
Determined to improve its agricultural production through exports of farm produce, Ogun State Government has taken steps to improve the quality of its cocoa produce, so as to meet up with demands in the international market.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Agriculture, Dr Adetunji Oredipe, made this known in his keynote address at the 2019 Annual Produce Stakeholders workshop and cocoa pre-season meeting, organised by the Produce Department of the Ministry of Agriculture in Abeokuta.

He noted that the state government had sought tailored cocoa fertilizer blends, which would rapidly improve yields from 300kg per hectare to about 500kg per hectare.

He urged stakeholders in the cocoa industry to join hands with the government to increase productivity of existing produce and develop new plantations for improved exportable agricultural produce.

He said, “This workshop has come at the right time, as the state is preparing for the new cocoa season. The global market as we have known, is good for our cocoa, with the global demand of 3.7 million metric tonnes of cocoa beans annually, we are trying to accelerate our production capacity to ensure we contribute a large chunk of the global demand.”
