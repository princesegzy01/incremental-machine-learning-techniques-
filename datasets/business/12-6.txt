Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

The Federal Government through the Ministry of Works and Housing has commenced the harmonisation of all procedures of land acquisition and transfers across the country.

According to the Permanent Secretary, FMWH, Muhammad Bukar, the harmonisation process will create seamless access when one is acquiring a piece of land.

Bukar said this on Wednesday at the ongoing 8th Meeting of the National Council on Lands, Housing and Urban Development in Abuja.

He also explained that the move would promote home- ownership targeted at low and middle-income earners in Nigeria.

He said his ministry in conjunction with the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria was focusing on rent-to-own or rental purchase scheme as well as the Cooperative Housing Programme for the construction of mass housing units for interested citizens.

In his address, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Capital Territory Administration, Chinyeaka Ohaa, stressed the need to develop the housing sector to enable Nigerians wishing to own their houses to do so with little or no strain.
