Enyo Retail and Supply, a firm in the downstream oil and gas sector, has rolled out series of exciting and rewarding activities to further enhance customer experience as part of the celebration of this year’s international Customer Service Week.

The firm dubbed it ‘The Magic of Service’ and said the theme recognised that good service was magical.

A statement from the organisation said, “It can turn an unhappy customer into a satisfied long-term customer. It can turn an occasional customer into a repeat customer.

“And it can turn any customer into your biggest fan and advocate.”

The firm added that the week offered it another opportunity to appreciate and remind customers of their continued commitment to their satisfaction.

The activities to mark the week were given as an upgrade of their loyalty programme – Enyo ThankU, with the new upgrade, which allowed the customers to earn points on every Enyo product and service.

In addition, the week gave Enyo retail corporate workers present at their outlets opportunity to engage customers to elicit their feedback.

Commenting on the week, the Chief Executive Officer, Enyo Retail and Supply, Abayomi Awobokun, said, “The theme of this year’s customer service week ‘Magic of Service’ aptly describes the mantra of Enyo.

“We are committed to continually offer our customers across all product and service offerings, top-notch customer experience that will stand us out, not just in the downstream oil and gas industry but in the service industry generally.”
