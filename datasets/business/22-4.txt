The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria has increased exemption subjects for graduates of five tertiary institutions in the country under the ICAN Cooperation Agreement with Tertiary Institutions.

The institutions are Benson Idahosa University, Igbinedion University, Bowen University, Al-Hikmah University and Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro.

This was disclosed during the signing of a Mutual Cooperation Agreement between ICAN and the five tertiary institutions in Lagos on Wednesday.

President, ICAN, Mazi Nnamdi Okwuadigbo, said, that ICAN’s MCATI aimed to deepen the standards of learning and dissemination of knowledge of accounting in Nigerian tertiary institutions.

He said, “I encourage you to continue to raise the standards higher as we all collectively work at strengthening the human capital base in our country. Undoubtedly, today’s event is an endorsement of the quality of your institutions’ accounting education.

“Accounting graduates from your institutions will now study using the integrated ICAN/NUC/NBTE Approved Accounting Curriculum. Your accounting graduates would now be granted 11 subject exemptions as against seven subjects’ exemption under the normal ICAN accreditation scheme.”
