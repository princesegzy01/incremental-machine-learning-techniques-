IEI Anchor Pension Managers Limited says its pension assets under management rose by 35 per cent to N92bn in the 2018 financial year, from N68.2bn in 2017.

A statement issued by the company said Chairman, Senator Jonathan Zwingina, disclosed this during IEI Anchor’s 2018 annual general meeting in Abuja.

He said the company maintained its growth trajectory as its Retirement Savings Accounts grew from 117,031 in 2017 to 131,047 in 2018.

Operations of the company, he added, ran smoothly, thereby leading to its general growth.

He said the management of the PFA was committed to ensuring that strategies put in place were driven to continually grow the company.

Zwingina promised the customers constant engagement and satisfaction, adding that the firm would work tirelessly to sustain the growth to the benefit of its shareholders and other stakeholders.

Its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr Glory Etaduovie, said the fees earned by the firm increased from N661m in 2017 to N774m in 2018, representing a 17 per cent growth.

He stated, “RSA fund unit price (now Fund II) grew from N2.21bn in 2017 to N2.42bn in 2018, a growth of 9.62 per cent as retiree fund unit price (now Fund IV) grew to N2.85bn, a growth of 11.44 per cent during the year under review.

Profit after tax, he said, increased from N1.4m in 2017 to N34.01m – a growth of 2,329 per cent in 2018.

While stating that the 2018 performance was targeted at driving and ensuring customer satisfaction, he added that the customer service centre at its head office was given a major facelift to make it more welcoming and comfortable to its clients, among other initiatives.

In 2019, he said the PFA intended to continue in its quest to satisfy its customers with a wider market base, while increasing the use of technology to reach and serve them.

He stated, “Our theme for 2019 is ‘Inclusion and |Digitisation’. We intend to bring everybody on board by reaching out to every segment of the economy. We will be relying more on technology to achieve this goal.”
