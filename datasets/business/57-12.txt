Nigeria’s population, a liability, says Sanusi
Ifeanyi Onuba, Abuja

The Emir of Kano, Mohammadu Sanusi II, has said that the Nigeria’s huge population is currently a liability to the country.

He said this on Monday during a panel session at the 25th Nigerian Economic Summit in Abuja.

The session was attended by the Founder of the Kukah Centre, Bishop Mathew Kukah, and Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi.

The session focused on how demographic realities could be transformed into social and business opportunities and the implications on internal migration, sustainable peace and security.

The emir said that the potential of the country’s huge population had yet to be tapped as the right policies to harness the future of the young people were still lacking.

Sanusi attributed the rate of kidnapping, armed robbery, insurgency, farmers-herders crisis to the level of population growth.

He said, “People say that our population is an asset but we are yet to get there. Nigeria’s population is currently a liability because problems such as kidnapping, armed robbery, Boko Haram, drug addiction are all tied to the population that we have.

And the question is how do you turn that into a productive one?”
