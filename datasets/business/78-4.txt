A non-governmental organisation, Gobir Organisation Foundation, has empowered 500 women traders in Kwara State with interest-free loans to boost their trade and alleviate poverty in the society.

The Chairman of the foundation, Yakub Gobir, said at the launch of GOF that the loans were given to the traders with the collaboration of Zenith Bank Plc.

He gave the amount disbursed at the programme as between N10,000 and N50,000, depending on the organisation’s assessment of the business proposal of each person, stressing that the foundation was also giving training to the beneficiaries in basic financial intelligence and entrepreneurship.

He said, “The aim of the foundation is to alleviate poverty which has become a major issue of concern in both Kwara State and nationally. The initiative was targeted at empowering the womenfolk, often recognised as the most vulnerable in our society.”

Gobir said that the 500 beneficiaries were selected from among the traders that met the conditions drawn by the financial experts of the foundation in four local government areas in the Kwara Central senatorial zone.
