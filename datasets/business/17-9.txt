Equity market-listed securities on NSE
The equities market sustained its bearish streak amidst profit taking activity. The lethargy performance was despite the positive Q3’19 financial results churned out by most corporates.

Consequently, NSE All-Share Index and market capitalisation both depreciated by 0.21 per cent to close the week at 26,293.30 and N12.799tn, respectively.

With this, the NSE ASI has returned negative 16.34 per cent year-to-date.

Hence, we saw two of the five sub-indices close in negative territory: NSE Banking and NSE Consumer Goods indices moderated by 0.46 per cent and 0.66 per cent to 316.56 points and 505.82 points respectively.

On the positive side, NSE Insurance, NSE Oil/Gas and NSE industrial indices rose by 0.33 per cent, 4.96 per cent and 1.05 per cent to 119.89 points, 235.70 points and 1047.79 points respectively.

We expect the key performance indicators to close in negative territory amidst bearish investor sentiment; however, we expect pockets of bargain hunting as value investors take advantage of the low prices even as dividend yields become attractive.

NASD – Unlisted securities

As at close of trade week, market capitalisation increased to N502.37bn from last week’s previous N499.72bn, which shows a 0.53 per cent increase in capitalisation. Also the NSI for the week ended November 1, 2019 recorded an increase from 695.57 points to 699.25 points.

Money market

Money market rates dropped by an average of c.130bps as liquidity remained relatively robust. Consequently, OBB and overnight rates closed the week at 3.00 per cent and 4.07 per cent, respectively.

During the outgone week, the apex bank sold N363.09bn worth of OMO bills; hence, the total outflows worth N495.65bn offset the total inflows from the matured T-bills worth N413.19bn.

We expect funding rates to remain within the single-digit region for most of next week, however, OMO T-bills and Retail FX auctions are expected to put pressure on rates closing the week.

Bonds market

The FGN bond market opened the month on a bearish note as yields retraced aggressively due to profit-taking and general investors’ apathy towards FGN bonds at these current yield levels.

The 2026 and 2037 papers took the most hit, increasing by 37bps and 30bps DoD while the 30-year bond remained steady throughout the trading session despite seeing most of the market flows. Consequently, yields trended up by an average of c.15bps across the benchmark yield curve.

We expect the market to remain order-driven as Local Investors cherry-pick FGN Bonds with attractive yields. The current regulatory stance on OMO T-bills is expected to provide strong support for FGN bonds in the short term.

Treasury bills market

The Treasury Bills market closed the trading week on a bullish note, as we saw improved demand flow through the market with more clarity on the settlement of NTB and OMO Bills. Offshore investors also used this opportunity to trade out their large NTBs holdings for higher-yielding OMO T-bills.

Local investor demand was largely skewed towards the newly issued 364- day NTB maturity, with most trades consummated within 10.50 per cent to 10.75 per cent. Yields dropped by an average of c.39bps across the benchmark yield curve, with clients trades dictating market direction.

With about N1.477tn worth of OMO T-bills maturing this month vis-a-vis N276.00bn of NTBs, we expect demand for NTBs to get more aggressive in the coming weeks as local investors (excluding banks) remain locked out from OMO Tbills trading. The NTB vs OMO T-bills switch strategy by offshore players is expected to persist in the near term as spreads get wider.

Foreign exchange market

At the interbank, the Naira/USD spot rate and SMIS rates remained stable to close the week at N307.00/$ and N358.13/$ respectively. The I&E FX window closing rate depreciated further by 9k to close at N362.75$. The Naira remained stable at the parallel markets, as both the cash and transfer rates closed unchanged at N358.00/$ and N362.50/$ respectively.

In the outgoing week, CBN injected a total of $210.00 million into the foreign exchange market; of which $100.00m was allocated to Wholesale (SMIS), $55.00m was allocated to Small and Medium Scale Enterprises and $55.00m was sold for invisibles.

We expect the naira to remain largely stable across the various windows of the currency space as the CBN maintains interventions in the FX market.
