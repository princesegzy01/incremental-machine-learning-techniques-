How to cancel a loan application
Nike Popoola

Loan applications are not considered binding contracts, so if you find a better deal after you have already submitted an application, or if you decide that you simply no longer want the loan, you may cancel it without facing repercussions. You do not need to submit the cancellation in writing. However, even with a verbal cancellation, it is still a good idea to take a systematic approach, according to https://www.sapling.com.

Cancellation process

You can cancel a loan application at any time before you sign the loan agreement and the funds are dispersed. One exception is mortgage refinancing loans which offer a longer window.

The easiest ways to initiate the cancellation are by phone or email. Either way, the procedure is the same. Contact the lender and tell it that you want to cancel a pending loan application. Provide the necessary personal identification information, such as your full name, date of birth any application number. It is not necessary to give a reason for the cancellation. However, if you are cancelling because you found better terms elsewhere, you may be able to get the lender to match or beat them by letting it know. You also can tell the lender if you are going to reapply at a later date so it can keep your information on file.

Fee refunds

Fee refunds generally are a matter of individual lender policy, as well as the kind of loan you applied for. Mortgage lenders, for instance, often will refund fees you paid at application for actions that have not been been performed, such as a credit check or appraisal. With other lenders, the fees go completely toward processing your application and you cannot receive a refund. Confirm the fee refund policy with your lender to be sure.

Understand loan option

According to https://www.consumerfinance.gov, Knowing what kind of loan is most appropriate for your situation prepares you for talking to lenders and getting the best deal.

A loan “option” is always made up of three different things:

Loan term

Interest rate type

Loan type

In general, the longer your loan term, the more interest you will pay. Loans with shorter terms usually have lower interest costs but higher monthly payments than loans with longer terms. But a lot depends on the specifics – exactly how much lower the interest costs and how much higher the monthly payments could be depends on which loan terms you’re looking at as well as the interest rate.

What to know

Shorter terms will generally save you money overall, but have higher monthly payments.

There are two reasons shorter terms can save you money:

You are borrowing money and paying interest for a shorter amount of time.

The interest rate is usually lower—by as much as a full percentage point.

Rates vary among lenders, especially for shorter terms. Explore rates for different loan terms so you can tell if you are getting a good deal. Always compare official loan offers before making your decision.

What to know

Your monthly payments are more likely to be stable with a fixed-rate loan, so you might prefer this option if you value certainty about your loan costs over the long term. With a fixed-rate loan, your interest rate and monthly principal and interest payment will stay the same. Your total monthly payment can still change—for example, if your property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, or mortgage insurance might go up or down.

Adjustable-rate mortgages offer less predictability but may be cheaper in the short term. You may want to consider this option if, for example, you plan to move again within the initial fixed period of an ARM. In this case, future rate adjustments may not affect you. However, if you end up staying in your house longer than expected, you may end up paying a lot more. In the later years of an ARM, your interest rate changes based on the market, and your monthly principal and interest payment could go up a lot, even double.

Explore rates for different interest rate types and see for yourself how the initial interest rate on an ARM compares to the rate on a fixed-rate mortgage.

Understanding adjustable-rate mortgages

Most ARMs have two periods. During the first period, your interest rate is fixed and won’t change. During the second period, your rate goes up and down regularly based on market changes.
