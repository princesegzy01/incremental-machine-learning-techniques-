the Department of Petroleum Resources has commenced a radiometric survey of the Bida Basin in Niger State in line with Federal Government’s aspiration to diversify oil and gas exploration across all basins in the country.

The Director, DPR, c, gave the indication when he paid a courtesy call on the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Bello, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso.

Shakur was quoted in a statement as saying that the objective of the radiometric survey “is to determine the hydrocarbon prospect of the Bida Basin.”

He said the exercise would cover 12 local government areas of the state.

The DPR boss solicited the cooperation of the state government in the sensitisation of the people in the affected local government areas to ensure a safe conduct of the programme.

The governor promised to give the DPR maximum support including the provision of adequate security for the survey team.

Bello said the state government was delighted to have the DPR, being the petroleum regulatory agency of Nigeria, carry out the survey in the state.

The DPR director also paid a visit to the Emir of Bida, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, to seek his cooperation and support for the radiometric survey.

The emir, according to the statement, assured the agency that he would support the programme and assist in the sensitisation of his people.
