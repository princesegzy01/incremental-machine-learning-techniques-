‘More foreign investors attracted to Nigeria’s property market’
Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi

The Managing Director of API Events, Kfir Rusin, says Nigeria’s property market has become attractive to regional and international real estate investors as the country diversifies its economy.

Rusin stated that Nigeria as well as Ghana’s property markets had progressed and evolved amidst tough trading conditions.

“The region’s real estate ecosystem is increasingly diversified and sophisticated, yet requires transparency, regulatory and policy certainty to attract and retain investments,” he said.

Speaking ahead of the 5th West Africa Property Investment Summit, coming up in November, Rusin said the West Africa’s real estate had become increasingly attractive to the DFIs, private equity firms, institutional and global investors.

He stated that this year’s WAPI theme, ‘Uncovering the next real estate investment cycle’, was developed with buy-in from local and international stakeholders, who believed in the region’s real estate market.

“With more than 400 delegates attending and 70 speakers confirmed, including several globally respected thought leaders, this year’s WAPI Summit will again advance the real estate agenda across the West African real estate value chain.” he added.

According to him, this year’s global investment keynote speaker will be REITWAY Global’s Chief Investment Officer, Garreth Elston.
