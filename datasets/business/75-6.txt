We are paying taxes, say DISCOs
Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

Power distribution companies on Thursday said it was incorrect for an executive of PriceWaterhouseCoopers to claim that no Disco had paid any tax since the power sector was privatised since 2013.

Speaking under the aegis of the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors, the umbrella body of Discos, the power firms stated that they had been paying taxes to both the federal and state governments.

The Executive Director, Research and Advocacy, ANED, Sunday Oduntan, stated that the Discos were paying different taxes even though they were challenged.

Oduntan stated that as responsible corporate citizens, all members of ANED took their tax obligations to the federal and state governments, as applicable, seriously.

He said, “As a result, the Discos diligently pay all necessary taxes that apply to their operations.

“These taxes include the minimum Company Income Tax, Withholding Tax and Value Added Tax.”

He said the Discos would like to encourage all parties interested in the growth and success of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry to constantly and diligently verify their information.
