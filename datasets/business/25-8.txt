We’ve automated all tax processes – Fowler
Nike Popoola

The Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service, Mr Babatunde Fowler, has said that improvement in revenue collection in the country over the last four years is partly due to the adoption of technology.

He said this made payment process more convenient in addition to providing information to taxpayers.

The FIRS chairman stated this at the inaugural edition of the Nigeria e-Government Conference in Lagos.

In a keynote address delivered on his behalf by the Assistant Director, e-Services and PEBEC Coordinator, FIRS, Dr Zainab Gobir, he said the FIRS had automated all its processes.

A statement said he explained that processes such as e-registration as well payment of stamp duty and Value Added Tax had benefited from the automation, an improvement on the service’s operations before 2016.

“Now, with all these initiatives put in place, our revenue has gone up tremendously, comparing it from 2015 to now. So, this goes to tell you that the FIRS is all about innovation and we are all about continuously improving our technology to better serve the taxpaying public and to serve the nation as a whole,” he said.

Fowler said that as part of its commitment to the utilisation of technology, the FIRS had a functional website which Nigerians could interact with and get their feedback promptly without visiting its physical office.

He stated, “The FIRS website is very robust to the point that if you check your phone now and visit our website, it would tell you the closest (FIRS) office to where you are.

“You can do your tax payment and enquiries on your phone in your house, in your offices, anywhere.”
