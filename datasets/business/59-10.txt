Science and tech budget paltry, says academy
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

The Nigerian Academy of Science has described as paltry and insufficient the amount budgeted over the years for the country’s science and technology sector.

The Ministry of Science and Technology, which has the mandate of implementing the National Policy on Science, Technology and Innovation, is one of the ministries that receive the least amount for capital projects.

In 2018, the total allocation for capital expenditure for the ministry and its 17 agencies was N43.2bn. The ministry’s allocation for capital expenditure rose slightly to N48.1bn in 2019.

Speaking in an interview with our correspondent, President of the Nigerian Academy of Science, Prof. Mosto Onuoha, observed that the allocation for science and technology in successive budgets was ‘laughable’.

“Our science and technology agencies are very poorly funded. The budget for science and technology is laughable,” Onuoha said.

Onuoha noted that the development suggests that the Federal Government did not value science and technology, especially its research and development component, which he described as ‘vital’ for the country’s progress.
