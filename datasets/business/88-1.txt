Jenniez School of African Interior Design organised its annual blueprint empowerment conference for entrepreneurs in Lagos.

The school said the annual blueprint conference aimed to empower interior designers, skilled workers, creatives, manufacturers and small and medium enterprises in the interior design industry.

According to a statement, the conference, which is in its second edition, seeks to empower attendees with practical tools, guidance and motivation and the professional networks needed to take their interior design businesses to the next level.

The Founder, JSAID, Jennifer Chukwujekwe, said the conference, which was themed ‘Collaboration within the interior design industry’, sought to represent and promote the built industry through advocacy, outreach, high standards, integrity, education and investment in the community.

She said, “It is one of the few programs that brings together design industry partners annually, to build partnerships and collaborations, and to foster peer learning and knowledge sharing around design.

“This conference provides an innovative platform for the public to hear from great thinkers and doers from a myriad of design related fields, and debate and discuss the most significant ideas, trends and issues of the day.”
