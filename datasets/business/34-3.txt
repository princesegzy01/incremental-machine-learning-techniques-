The immediate past coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps in Osun, State, Mr Emmanuel Attah, has been appointed as the first coordinator of the NYSC in the South-West.

Attah was redeployed to Osogbo, the Osun State capital where he will coordinate the NYSC in the six states in the region including Lagos State.

Attah, who confirmed his redeployment to our correspondent on the telephone said the new office would decentralise the scheme’s activities and make monitoring of corps members easier.

He said the zonal office would be in charge of all the six states in the South-West Zone and would be saddled with the responsibility of monitoring the mobilisation of corps members.

Attah said, “The NYSC has created zonal offices in the six geo-political zones. This will decentralise the activities of the zone and make monitoring much easier than before.

“The management of the scheme wants things to be done better and the interest of the corps members is paramount in every decision.

“The zonal office will bridge the distance between Abuja and each of the states and at the end it will benefit corps members more.”

Attah, who served as Osun State NYSC coordinator from January 2017, was recalled to the corps headquarters in Abuja in June 2019 to become the Deputy-Director, Training and Executive Decisions.

He has resumed in his new office in Osogbo.
