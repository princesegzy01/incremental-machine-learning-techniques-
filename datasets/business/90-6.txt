Itex Integrated Services Limited, a financial technology company, has been granted a super agent licence by the Central Bank of Nigeria to operate in the financial sector.

A statement by the company on Tuesday said the licence would enable Itex to provide basic financial services such as account opening, BVN capture, funds transfer, cash withdrawals, bill payments to the unbanked, particularly in rural areas.

According to the company, the licence will also enable it to recruit more agents to carry out financial services.

Commenting on the achievement, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Itex Integrated Services Limited, Mr Ernest Uduje, expressed his excitement at the full approval the company received to be a super agent.

He said “We are indeed happy to have qualified for this licence. Our primary goal is to provide ease of financial services and transactions for our customers, including those in the rural areas. This licence gives us an opportunity to provide these services on an even larger scale, thus providing financial empowerment to the unbanked and under-banked.”
