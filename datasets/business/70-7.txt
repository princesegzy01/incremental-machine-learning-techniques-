Seaport: Cross River gets FGâ€™s business case certificate
Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

The Federal Government on Monday issued a Business Case Certificate to Cross River State for the state to go ahead with plans to construct its deep seaport.

Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, who came for the OBC at the Federal Ministry of Transportation in Abuja, said the certificate would enable the state to take the next step towards the implementation of the deep seaport.

Ayade was received at the FMT by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.

The minister told journalists on the sidelines of their meeting that the Nigerian Ports Authority would sit with the state to determine how much it would invest in the ports.
