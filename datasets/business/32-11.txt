Funding, RoW delay 30,000km telecom infrastructure

The laying of 30,000 kilometres of fibre optic infrastructure in the six geopolitical zones of the country is yet to commence one year after the licensing of infrastructure companies by the Nigerian Communications Commission.

The operators said securing funding for the project had been difficult because policies surrounding right of way had been inconsistent.

According to them, building a business case has been difficult while the estimation of capital expenditure required for the project is not convincing investors.

Speaking on behalf of the licensed holders on Wednesday, the President, Association of Telecommunication Companies of Nigeria, Olusola Teniola, said the cost of infrastructure roll-out was enormous because states and local governments failed to comply with the N145 per linear metre that was fixed by the National Executive Council as charges for right of way.

He said state and local governments charged more than N500 per linear metre, making the investment unprofitable for the infracos.

He said the South-West, South-East and South-South were regions known for high cost of right of way.

“In the South-West, especially Lagos, the right of way is still an issue and in the South-East and the South-South, access to the right of way is difficult. The cost is a serious deterrent to rolling out of infrastructure. It has not been normalised to N145 per linear metre as was agreed by the National Executive Council some years ago. Obviously, the cost of deployment is quite exorbitant and if the subsidy is not sufficient, it will render the project unviable,” Teniola said.
