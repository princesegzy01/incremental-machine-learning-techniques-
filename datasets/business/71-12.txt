Edo State Government has been listed among the top seven states in Nigeria that are up to date with the Contributory Pension Scheme guidelines and remittances of funds into workers’ Retirement Savings Accounts.

A statement from the state said this achievement was linked to Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki’s pension reforms, which focused on benefitting the state’s workers.

It added that the rating was contained in the second quarter 2019 report of the National Pension Commission, which listed Edo State alongside Delta, Ekiti, FCT, Jigawa, Kaduna and Lagos as up to date in their remittance of pension fund deductions from the salaries of their employees as well as in remitting their own part of contributions into the RSAs of their employees.

“Under the Governor Obaseki-led administration, Edo State has migrated the state’s workers to the CPS, ensuring that workers benefit from the numerous advantages of the scheme,” the statement said.

It added that the governor had continued to clear arrears owed pensioners by previous administrations in the state, while the government had presented no less than N50m to the next of kin of deceased beneficiaries under the CPS since the commencement of the scheme in 2017.

According to the statement, the governor has also set up modalities to enrol local council workers into the CPS to enable them to benefit from the improved scheme.
