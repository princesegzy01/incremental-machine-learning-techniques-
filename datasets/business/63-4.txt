The National Agricultural Seeds Council has raised the alarm over the existence of adulterated seeds in Plateau State and other parts of the country.

The North-Central Regional Director of NASC, Mr Sola Adelere, who spoke at a forum in Jos on Thursday, therefore, warned farmers and other stakeholders against buying seeds from roadside peddlers and unknown sources.

Adelere said, “The quality and the maintenance of seed planted will determine the ultimate yield.

“However, there have been reported cases of seed adulteration in the state and this is affecting agricultural productivity, profitability and sustainability, which in turn put a threat to food security and self-sufficiency hence the meeting, to discuss the way forward.”

The regional director said he had, however, been assured by the Director General of NASC, Mr Philip Ojo, that the National Agricultural Seed Act would be implemented to the letter and all those found wanting would face the full wrath of the law.
