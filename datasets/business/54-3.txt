Allianz to reduce marine risks with portal
Nike Popoola

Allianz Nigeria, local operating entity of global insurer, Allianz, says it is providing a self-service insurance portal that allows users to book short-term marine insurance covers.

It stated that the Nigerian fast-moving consumer goods industry continued to be imports-intensive because of the need to ship in essential items necessary for local manufacturing.

These imports were not only capital intensive but were also associated with significant risks such as theft, damage (either by fire or water) and loss in transit.

It stated that frequent importation required frequent insurance covers which took up administrative time for quotes, rates and insurance certificates either directly from the clients or insurance brokers.

The B2B Sales Director, Allianz Nigeria, Mrs Taiwo Tella-Ndukwe, stated, “Here at Allianz Nigeria, we have developed an online application, a ‘Marine Portal’, designed to enable business people service their marine insurance needs by reducing administrative turnaround time in generating quotes, sending emails, issuing insurance certificates, and so on.

“It also caters to business interruption by allowing the opportunity to work on weekends and public holidays. Then there is the cost savings element for both parties by obviating the need for use of stationery items such as papers, stamps, and the like.”
