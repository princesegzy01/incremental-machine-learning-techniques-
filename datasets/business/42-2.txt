There was a mild drama on Wednesday at the Industrial and General Insurance Plc headquarters in Lagos as workers protested against the alleged sacking of over 60 employees by the company.

During the protest, the workers were seen carrying placards and chanting solidarity songs.

It was gathered that the sack letters were distributed to the affected workers via Whatsapp.

The workers accused the company of owing them 20-month salaries.

The PUNCH learnt from the protesters that efforts to get company’s Managing Director, Racheal Emenike, to pay their outstanding salaries were rebuffed, as she reportedly claimed that the debt was not incurred during her tenure.

The Chairman, Coalition of IGI Staff, Samson Onipede, said, “IGI has been going through liquidity issues overtime and staff members have been enduring and sacrificing for the company. But when the MD came in eight months ago, everyone thought that she would take the company in a new direction to save it from liquidation, but it turned out to be a mistake.”

But the spokesperson for the company, Mr Steve Ilo, said, “It’s true some workers were disengaged in continuation of the ongoing turnaround programme aimed at reviving the company.

‘Those affected came to our office in the morning to protest the decision. For the management, it was a hard decision to make. But the measure was long overdue and it had to be taken in order to save the company from sudden death.”
