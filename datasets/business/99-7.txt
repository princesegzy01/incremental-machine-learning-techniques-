ABC names Sunfresh continental award winner
Sunfresh has been named as the winner of the 2019 Africa’s Best Premium Quality Bread Award.

The announcement was made at the 5th edition of the African Brand Leadership Merit Awards organised by the African Brand Congress held in Lagos.

Sunfresh is manufactured by FoodCo Nigeria Limited, a diversified consumer goods company with interests in retail supermarket chain, quick service restaurants, entertainment and manufacturing.

Speaking on the award, Convener of ABC, Desmond Esorougwe, stated that the decision to award Sunfresh the prize was taken following research conducted by the body’s technical committee on different brands across the continent.

He said, “This award is based on rigorous work and subsequent recommendations from our technical committee following a survey carried out on selected brands across Africa.

“We are impressed by the positive feedback from respondents about the Sunfresh Bread range in the baking and confectionery category. I must say, this award is well-deserved because the brand is only six years old but in its relatively young lifespan, it has made significant impact on the market especially in the areas of innovation, quality and customer satisfaction.”
