Saham Unitrust Insurance Nigeria Limited has made its travel insurance solution available online to enable customers to conveniently get their travel insurance policies from any part of the world.

The company said this was part of its efforts to be innovative and continue to make insurance more accessible to the public.

It added that the company had continued to improve its services in a bid to remain competitive in the ever dynamic business world and meet the needs of the insuring public.

Explaining the benefits of its cover, the company said the travel insurance cover would serve the travellers better, reduce operational costs and improve professional efficiency.

According to the firm, unlike the current system where every transaction is typed on individual workstations and stored in multiplicity of places, the new solution is designed to run on an enterprise database platform that will allow all transactions to be generated at the click of a button.

A statement by the firm said it had sealed a partnership arrangement with Swan International Assistance to provide travel insurance for intending travellers to all Schengen countries and worldwide coverage against emergency medical assistance; repatriation and evacuation; urgent medical expenses; repatriation of mortal remains; emergency dental coverage; trip cancelation; sea and mountain search and rescue; as well as loss of baggage and passport.

Saham Unitrust is a limited liability company licensed in 1986 to carry out all forms of general insurance transactions including oil and gas.
