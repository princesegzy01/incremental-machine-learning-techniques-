Professionals seek periodic tax review
Nike Popoola

Tax professionals have said there is need for periodic review of tax policy and legislation in order to provide clarity and ensure synergy between tax policy, tax legislation and and tax administration.

Some tax professionals spoke during seminars organised by the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria, which took place in Abuja and Lagos.

The seminar was on current issues in Nigerian taxation, and it focused on issues such as Value Added Tax, stamp duties, new Joint Tax Board TIN registration and Police Trust Fund Act.

They mentioned the need for justiciability of the directive principles of state policy to promote accountability, regular update of the database to widen the tax net, eliminating inherent loopholes, and full deployment of technology to aid tax administration and to simplify tax compliance procedures.

According to them, there was also a need for education of taxpayers in order to encourage voluntary compliance.
