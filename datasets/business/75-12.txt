‘Obsolete curriculum responsible for graduate unemployment’
A staff solutions architect for VMWARE, Mr Deji Akomolafe, has linked the graduate un-employability in the country to obsolete curriculum used by Nigerian universities and training centres.

Akomolafe saidthis while briefing journalists at the African Engineering Education Association International Conference held at the University of Lagos.

He described Virtualise Africa as a corporate responsibility programme that VMWARE created to help in solving the problems of youth unemployment and knowledge gap in Africa.

“We realised that people are interested in technologies and they gravitate towards the easy-to-access disciplines like web development and programming but stay away from the complicated high-paying essential components like virtualisation, cloud and technology,” he said.

Akomolafe added, “The reason they do that is because those disciplines require extensive investment and not just financially but in resources like network access, data access and general infrastructure.

“What we are trying to do is if Africa is claiming that they have high unemployment rate, we need to be able to re-evaluate the reason for this. Is it because the jobs are not there or that the jobs are out there but we are not producing professionals who can take advantage of the jobs?”

He noted that the reason for a disconnect between education and its direct impact on the society was because training centres and universities in Nigeria teach students using dated curriculum, which makes the students redundant and unfit to meet current job requirements in the labour market.

The President, Africa Engineering Education Association, Faculty of Engineering, University of Lagos, Prof. FunshoFalade, said engineers had the skills to analyse and proffer appropriate solutions using scientific ideas.
