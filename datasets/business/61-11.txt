The Nigerian Ports Authority says between January 2018 when it received court injunction stopping it from shutting down terminal B and June 2019 when the terminal was finally shut down for safety reasons, BUA enjoyed peaceful occupation of the premises and berthed 117 vessels made up of liquid and dry bulk cargoes.

NPA stated this on Friday while refuting fresh allegations of disobedience to court order on termination of its lease, brought against it by BUA, operators of Terminal B in Port Harcourt port.

The NPA had recently stopped vessels from berthing at the terminal when BUA wrote to it to inform it that the quays walls were in a state of disrepair and the terminal was almost collapsing.

In a statement signed by the General Manager, Corporate and Strategic Communications, NPA, Jatto Adams, the agency said the agency did not disobey court order concerning the termination of the lease.
