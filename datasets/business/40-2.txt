Ogun on investment opportunities
The government of Ogun State says it is irrevocably committed to deepening its investment potential towards retaining its status as the largest industrial hub in the sub-Saharan Africa through urgent and massive construction and rehabilitation of interstate and critical intrastate roads.

The state governor, Dapo Abiodun, gave the assurance at the Ogun West Senatorial District’s Town Hall meeting on 2020 budget and Medium Term Expenditure Framework for 2020-2022 in Ilaro.

Abiodun highlighted some of the roads to include Lagos-Abeokuta, Epe-Lagos and Ogijo- Ikorodu roads among others, saying it was important to embark on road infrastructure to attract more investment to the state.

He said Ogun West Senatorial District had great potential of becoming another world-class industrial hub of the state, due to the proximity of two local government areas in the district, namely Ipokia and Imeko-Afon, to Lagos State and international markets.

He said these roads would be included in the budget.

The governor added that more model school buildings would be converted to technical and vocational training centres. “Unfortunately, the model school in Ilaro has been recommended for demolition because it has been adjudged by professionals to be structurally defective,” he added.

In his remark, a former governorship aspirant in the state, Prince Gboyega Isiaka, appealed to Governor Abiodun to declare an emergency in the roads in Ogun West Senatorial District, urging indigenes to support the government through prompt payments of taxes and levies to aid rapid development.

The Olu of Ilaro and Paramount Ruler of Yewa Land, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, pledged allegiance of his people to the governor Abiodun- led administration.
