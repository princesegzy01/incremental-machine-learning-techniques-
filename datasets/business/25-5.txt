Experts, including business advisers at Detail Commercial Solicitors, have said family businesses need effective collaboration, resilience and good corporate governance structure to achieve multigenerational success.

They spoke at the ninth Business Series organised by Detail Commercial Solicitors, with the theme, ‘The Future of Family Business – Building Multigenerational Enterprises’.

The Associate Partner, Detail Commercial Solicitors, Chukwudi Ofili, said there was a need for effective collaboration between business founders, generations that will take over and employees

He said, “Effective collaboration between founders, the next generation and non-family staff by utilising an effective corporate governance structure is essential to the future of a family enterprise.”

According to a statement, the event was hosted in collaboration with Nike Anani, a coach assisting next generation family members in family businesses.

She was quoted as saying, “To build resilience in our family businesses, we must diversify by building up a performing investment portfolio that has a low correlation with the existing family business, in terms of asset type, geography, industry and currency.”

The Co-founder and Executive Director, Falcon Corporation Limited, Audrey Joe-Ezigbo, highlighted the importance of intentionally managing workplace and family relationship.

She also stressed the need to place the right structures and frameworks in place “to ensure that a business outlives its founders.”
