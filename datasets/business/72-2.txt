Domestic carrier, Air Peace, on Friday commenced flight service to Warri.

The inaugural flight operated with an ERJ 145 aircraft arrived at the Osubi Airport, Warri at 11.15am, piloted by Capt. Crosby Otobo.

The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Air Peace, Mr Allen Onyema, said the move to extend operations to Warri was part of the airline’s ‘No city-left-behind’ project.

Onyema, who was represented by the Manager, Ground Operations, Air Peace, Mr Adeyemi Ayodeji, said Warri was the 16th city the airline was operating into in Nigeria.

“We want to assure our passengers that this is just the beginning. We have plans to introduce flights from Warri to Port Harcourt and from Warri to Abuja,” he said.

He explained that the airline had five regional routes in West Africa and on July 5, 2019, began flight operations to Sharjah, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

According to him, Mumbai in India and Guangzhou, China will soon come on board as part of the airline’s expansion on the international routes with its fleet of B777 aircraft.

Onyema added that the flight to Warri would be once daily and assured the airline’s passengers of on-time departure and safety which he said were important to the airline’s operations.
