‘MSMEs should champion rebuilding of Borno’
Kayode Idowu

The rebuilding process of Borno State should be championed by Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Development Bank of Nigeria Plc, Mr Tony Okpanachi, has said.

Speaking at the maiden MSMEs summit organised by the bank in Maiduguri on Tuesday, Okpanachi said: “Before the outbreak of insurgency, over a decade ago, Borno State had a reputation as one of the thriving nerve centres of the North-East, owing to the strength of its commercial, trading and export potential. It was truly an ecosystem where MSMEs thrived.”

He noted that though there were challenges, he added that the bank would partner with the state government in its Ten Point Agenda that included growing the economy and to ensure that the rebuilding process continued with the MSMEs at the fore.

Okpanachi said as part of DBN’s mandate of providing sustainable financing, Maiduguri was chosen as a veritable location to host the first ever DBN MSMEs Summit, which was a direct response to the layers of exclusion occasioned by insurgency.

He, however, said a major challenge faced by the MSMEs “ is their inability to structure and put together a bankable business plan which makes banks view them as high risk and therefore unwilling to finance them.”

He said DBN would put together an immediate capacity building plan that would involve assembling a number of MSMEs in the state and making them go through an extensive capacity building programme.

This, he said, would equip them with the relevant know-how and make them attractive to the participating financial institutions.
