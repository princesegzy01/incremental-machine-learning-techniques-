August power collapse dents grid stability in Q3
Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

After recording eight system collapses in the first and second quarters of 2019, Nigeria’s power grid tried to stabilise in the third quarter but witnessed a collapse on August 30.

It was observed that apart from the August 30 incident, the grid recorded no collapse in the months of July, August and September.

Data obtained by our correspondent from the Federal Ministry of Power on Wednesday in Abuja showed that in July 2019, power generation on the grid revolved around 5,092.9 megawatts and 2,646.2MW.

An analysis of daily power generation figures for July showed that the highest peak of 5,092.9MW was recorded on July 16.

The lowest quantum of energy, 2,646.2MW, delivered on the grid during the month was recorded on July 12.

In August, the grid maintained some stability for most part of the month but collapsed totally to 20MW on August 30.

It, however, picked up the next day as peak generation climbed to 3,930.5MW, while the lowest generation on August 31 was 2,877.4MW.

The highest quantum of energy generated on the grid in August was 4,956.3MW and it was supplied by power generation companies on August 18.

In September, the grid recorded no collapse, as power released by Gencos hovered around 2,137.6MW and 4,860.6MW.

The highest grid generation figure of 4,860.6MW was recorded on September 13, while the lowest quantum of power, 2137.6MW, supplied to the grid by Gencos during the month was on September 4.

Only one report on grid performance had been released for October 2019, as a peak of 4,330.1MW and a lowest figure of 2,837.7MW were recorded on October 1.

The Managing Director, Transmission Company of Nigeria, Usman Mohammed, on several occasions had said the TCN was working hard to stabilise the country’s power grid and that this had started paying off.

He also explained that the about $1.6bn loans from international multilateral donors had helped in stabilising grid frequency.
