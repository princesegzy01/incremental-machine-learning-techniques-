Mr Bigg’s extends new combo store
In its bid to reposition its brand, one of the leading quick service restaurants, Mr Bigg’s, has opened a new state-of-the-art combo store at Amuwo Odofin, Lagos.

The first of its contemporary restaurant was opened in Northwest Filling station in Victoria Garden City, Lekki in July 2019.

Residents of Amuwo Odofin and Festac Town, suburbs in Lagos, have thus commended UAC Restaurants Limited, owners of Mr. Bigg’s, for locating the contemporary combo store housing two of its brands, Mr Bigg’s and Debonairs Pizza, in their neighbourhood.

Recall that UAC Restaurants Limited recently commenced remodelling of its Mr Bigg’s stores nationwide in a new initiative aimed at positively redefining the lifestyle of its numerous customers.

While commending the new state-of-the-art combo store housed by Peridot filling station at Amuwo Odofin, a businessman, Ademola Shabi, said, “The location of this store could not come at a better time than now.”

Shabi, who said he is a fan of Debonairs Pizza, described the new combo store as a fantastic place for family hangout.

He added, “Unlike other outlets, this new one meets international standard with quality service and good ambience for all occasions.”

Another customer, Linda Moneme, who visited with her family expressed joy over the new store particularly the modern facilities and excellent customer service.

She said, “A good family restaurant is one that offers delicious food that reminds people of the favourite meals their mothers cooked when they were kids.

“Apart from good food, the new store also possesses capacity for customer service and its response time beats others in this area.”

UAC Restaurants Limited promised to sustain excellence in its wide variety of dishes, pastries and confectioneries to the delight of its teeming consumers.
