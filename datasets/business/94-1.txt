The Federal Government will today Tuesday September 17, 2019 inaugurate 98.8KW solar hybrid mini grid power plant at Kare-Dadin Kowa, in Kebbi State.

This is part of its commitment to providing equitable access to electricity across regions in Nigeria.

It did this, according to statement, through the Rural Electrification Agency.

Kare-Dadin Kowa is a small riverine community in Argungun Local Government Area of Kebbi State, which is said to have a total population of about 3,180 people, whose major vocations are agriculture and fishing.

According to the statement, the newly inaugurated solar hybrid mini grid system would provide clean energy to 483 residential buildings, 82 commercial buildings and serve over 3,000 inhabitants of Kare-Dadin Kowa.

It added that a total of 565 high grid solar panels had been installed to power homes, businesses, places of worship, schools and health centres among others.

The Nigerian Rural Electrification Agency is the implementing agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria tasked with electrification of unserved and underserved communities.

It provides equitable access to electricity across Nigeria to maximize the economic, social and environmental benefits of rural electrification grants; to promote off-grid electrification, and stimulate innovative approaches to rural electrification.

REF projects are said to be administered using a Public Private Partnership model. The first phase of the project would energise 12 communities and deploy 19,000 solar home systems.
