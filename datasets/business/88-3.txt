‘TVS’ll continue to invest in Africa’
The Executive Vice-President, International Business, TVS Motor Company, RDilip, has said that the firm will continue to invest in Africa, especially the Nigerian market.

This assurance came on the heels of the company’s feat of having crossed one-millionth (product) mark in the unit sales of its TVS HLX series of motorcycles, which was launched in 2013.

According to him, the company also provides two-wheelers and three-wheelers for personal use as well as for commercial point-to-point transportation.

RDilip, who said the company had been operating in the country for over a decade, noted Nigeria was an important market for the products.

He said, “Nigeria is an important market for our company and we have been present here for over a decade. With the help of our distributors, our products have found acceptance in the market with TVS HLX becoming the fastest growing motorcycle in its category.

“The quality and reliability synonymous with TVS Motor Company has resonated strongly with our customers. Certainly, the investments made by the company and our distributor, particularly in our assembly plants and service centres across the country, have been critical to this.

“The one-million (product) milestone is a reinforcement of TVS Motor Company’s endeavour to continue offering superior products and complement them with dedicated customer satisfaction initiatives.”

He said the company would continue to innovate and come up with new products as it aimed to be on top of its game in about 60 countries across the globe.
