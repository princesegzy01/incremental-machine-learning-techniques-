From the data, it shows that Nigeria exported additional goods worth N7.3bn in the three months from April to June.

According to the NBS, the bulk of export transactions in Q2 was conducted through Apapa port, valued at N4.4tn, or 96 per cent, followed by Lilypond port which recorded N73.2bn and Tin Can Island port which recorded N6.9bn.

In terms of imports, Apapa Port also recorded the highest transactions valued at N1.84tn or 46.1 per cent. This was followed by Tin Can Island (N788.8bn or 19.7 per cent) and Port-Harcourt-3 (N444.3bn or 11.1 per cent), Calabar Port -N143.6bn, Port Harcourt-1-N80.5bn, Warri Port -N51.7bn.

Increase in trade volume in Apapa port compared to the other ports in Lagos is attributable to the rehabilitated 2-kilometre Apapa/Wharf road.

The project which began in 2017 June was jointly funded by AG Dangote Construction, Flour Mills and the Nigerian Ports Authority. It was completed in September 2018.

Since the completion of the road, traffic flow has been smooth up to the Apapa port gate.

Speaking about the improved situation of things in the area, the President General, Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, Adewale Adeyanju, commended the government for the work, saying that it had eased a lot of problems for operators in the area.

The National Coordinator, Save Nigeria Freight Forwarders, Dr Osita Chukwu, said the improved traffic had restored business to the area and also brought down cost for people doing business at Apapa port.

He called for speed in the ongoing rehabilitation of the Apapa/Oshodi and Mile 2 axis.
