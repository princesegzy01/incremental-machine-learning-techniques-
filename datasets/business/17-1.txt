Farming equipment procured by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will be sold to farmers at 50 per cent discount, the ministry has said.

The Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mustapha Shehuri, in a statement on Sunday, was quoted as saying that the move was to show governmentâ€™s determination at improving the production capacity of farmers.

He said the gesture was to also help actualise the food sufficiency policy and income generation initiative of the current administration.
