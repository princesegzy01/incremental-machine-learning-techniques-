Minimum wage implementation divisive –TUC
Anna Okon

The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria has frowned on the recent announcement by the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Dr Chris Ngige, that federal workers on Levels 1 to 6 had been paid the N30,000 National Minimum Wage.

The union described the move as divisive.

It stated that the real issue with minimum wage was with workers from grade level 7 upwards and not the ones below.

“The workers on grade level 1 to 6 are very few. Majority of the workers are on grade level 7 and above,” the Secretary of the Lagos State chapter of the union, Abiodun Aladetan, told our correspondent on the sidelines of a two-day annual workshop organised by the TUC, Lagos State Council on Wednesday.

Also speaking to our correspondent on the sidelines of the event, the Chairman, TUC, Ogun chapter, Mr Olubunmi Fajobi, said the implementation of the minimum wage to levels 1 to 6 by the government was an attempt to divide the labour force.
