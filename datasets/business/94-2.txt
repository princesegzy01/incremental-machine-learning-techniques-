Patrick Odey, Uyo

The Niger Delta Monitoring Group, a non-governmental organisation, with support from Oxam in Nigeria, has appealed to the Federal

Government to rescind its decision to increase the rate of valued-added tax.

It asked the government to rather block all financial leakages, illicit flows and capital flights in all sectors of the economy.

This was part of the recommendations contained in a communiqué issued by the Executive Director of the group, Dr George-Hill Anthony, at the end of a two-day Impact Harvesting Gathering and Co-Hearing event in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.

According to the recommendations made available to our correspondent on Monday, the group called on the Federal Government to step up effective security apparatuses to provide an enabling environment for the economy to thrive.

The recommendations read in part, “The Federal Government should step up effective security apparatuses, which will provide enabling environment for a thriving economy.

“Rather than an increased in VAT, government should block leakages, illicit financial flows and capital flight in all sectors by stimulating citizens-ownership of anti-corruption crusade.”

The group called on the state governments including Akwa Ibom State that had yet to key into the Open Governance Partnership to inaugurate and support the initiative in order to fast-track development through participatory democratic process.
