95% of technology used in Nigeria imported — NOTAP
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

The National Office for Technology Acquisition and Promotion has expressed concern at the huge sums being spent by Nigerian organisations to acquire relevant technology, saying 95 per cent of technology being utilised in all sectors of the country’s economy were imported.

Director General of NOTAP, Dr Dan-Azumi Ibrahim, said this in Abuja on Thursday.

He said, “The quantum of money that goes out of Nigeria as licencing fee (for technology transfers) is too high and should be of concern to all patriotic Nigerians.”

He blamed the development on poor funding of research and development in the country, a situation which he said had made it difficult to generate technology locally.

Nigeria faces a bleak future if the situation was not reversed, he warned.

“So long as we continue to use our scarce foreign reserves to import goods and services, we can’t develop as a nation,” Ibrahim added.

He said the situation could change if Nigerians patronised made-in-Nigeria products and services, in line with the Federal Government’s local content policy.

However, he observed that, despite poor funding of research and development, Nigerian researchers were making efforts to generate technological innovations.

“If you look at the number of publications in both national and international journals, we are among the highest in Africa, but this does not translate to economic development,” he noted.
