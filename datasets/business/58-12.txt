Dealers tackle Customs for sealing car shops
Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

The Association of Motor Dealers of Nigeria has urged its members to remain calm as AMDON will use every legal means to pursue the resolution of the current issue between car dealers and the Nigeria Customs Service.

AMDON said the recent sealing of car marts by the NCS was done out of mere suspicion and was an infringement on the collective right of car dealers to do business in Nigeria.

The association’s National President, Ajibola Adedoyin, who said this during a press briefing in Abuja on Sunday declared that the action by the NCS was unacceptable.

He said, “AMDON is not in support of non-payment of duty on vehicles as we have always maintained. But we found the recent action by the NCS as brazen, intimidating, harassing and utter disregard of our rights to survive.

“We are using this medium to advise our members across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory to remain calm and law-abiding while we use every peaceful and legal means to pursue the resolution of this matter.”

Adedoyin stated that car dealers were shocked by the dimension of sealing their outlets by the NCS for several days “only for suspicion that 90 per cent of all vehicles on the premises did not pay duty.”

He challenged the customs to deal with erring officers in its workforce, as they connived with fraudsters to bring in cars into Nigeria without proper clearance.

The association demanded an immediate unsealing of its members’ car marts, stressing that the sealing of car shops would never be a solution to the issue of non-payment or customs duty.
