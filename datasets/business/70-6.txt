The North-West centre comprises seven states, which are Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Jigawa, Sokoto and Zamfara.

The Executive Secretary, , Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate, Dr Chioma Ejikeme, disclosed this at the North-West verification centre in Kaduna on Monday.

She said out of the over 13,000 pensioners targeted for the verification in the zone, over 8,000 had completed the exercise with pensioners in Sokoto State being the first to complete theirs.

She also disclosed that pension liability in the country, now stood at over N10bn.

Ejikeme said PTAD was committed to ensuring that pensioners were treated with respect and dignity that they deserved, having served their father land meritoriously.

According to her, PTAD will commence payment of pensioners as soon as the verification was over and funds made available, adding that the verification would take into consideration harmonisation.

The PTAD boss said, â€œThe whole idea (verification) is to compute what we owe the pensioners; what we have been able to pay them; whether they are getting their monthly pensions and what they are supposed to get.
