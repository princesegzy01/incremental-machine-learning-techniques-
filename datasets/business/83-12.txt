Experts from across the world will join their Nigerian counterparts to seek solutions to issues challenging the real estate industry in Nigeria, the International Real Estate Federation, FIABCI Nigeria has said.

The President, FIABCI Nigeria Chapter, Mr Adeniji Adele, said the organisation was a platform for learning, networking as well as harnessing immeasurable experiences and opportunities.

He stated that the Principal at World Citizen Consulting, Bill Endsley, and Director of Operations and Finance at Michael Consults, Thomas Cardman, would join other Nigerians to focus attention on real estate issues when stakeholders gather for the FIABCI International Real Estate Consultants programme this week.

According to him, this year’s edition of the annual programme, which is to be hosted in Lagos, on September 26 and 27 by the FIABCI-Nigeria Chapter, will focus on insightful discussions that will touch on both global and local real estate issues.

“It is expected that the international speakers at the FIREC programme will be bringing global perspectives to the endless search for solutions to the problems of this sector in Nigeria,” he said.
