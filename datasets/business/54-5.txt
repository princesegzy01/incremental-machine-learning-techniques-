FBNQuest says it is committed to empowering women in collaboration with She Leads Africa, a community for young African women looking to build successful careers and businesses.

A statement said it supported the ‘SLAY Festival’ event which took place in Lagos recently.

The firm said the third edition of the SLAY Festival featured mentorship and interactive experiences that cut across business, investment, career, and technology, among others.

Since the inception of the festival, over 4,000 women had been brought together to learn new skills, build their networks and connect with their favourite brands, it added.

Initiated in 2017, the partnership was established as an innovative approach towards educating and engaging women on the importance of investing and estate planning.

It stated that the overall objective was to ensure that women imbibed wise investment and financial planning habits, in order to enable them to be more deliberate about preparing for the future and achieving their short, medium or long-term financial goals.

Commenting on the alliance, the Head of Communications and Knowledge Engagement at FBNQuest, Lolade Sasore, stated, “We believe strategic partnerships are an important tool for achieving real impact, and we are committed to collaborating with reputable organisations to deliver wider and more sustainable results across our different businesses.

“We started this partnership with SLAY over two years ago to help women become more aware and confident about investing, because we know there is an immense opportunity for economic growth and social impact when more women invest for the future.
