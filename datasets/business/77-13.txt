Nigeria’s oil production projected to decline through 2050

A net decrease in crude oil production will occur in Nigeria and West Africa between 2018 and 2050, the United States Energy Information Administration has said.

The EIA, in its latest International Energy Outlook 2019, predicted that crude oil and lease condensate production by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will grow by 37 per cent between 2018 and 2050, from 35 million barrels per day in 2018 to 48 million bpd in 2050.

It said OPEC would continue to supply a large portion of the world market, accounting for over 40 per cent of global oil supplies through the projection period.

The EIA said, “OPEC crude oil and lease condensate production is largely concentrated in the Middle East, which increases from 27 million bpd in 2018 to 39 million bpd in 2050, a 44 per cent increase. Production from large, low-cost oil resources in the Middle East remains a critical part of global crude oil supply during the projection period.

“OPEC countries in North Africa and South America increase crude oil and lease condensate production but represent a smaller share of total OPEC growth. A net decrease in crude oil and lease condensate production occurs in Central and West Africa because of increasingly less cost-competitive onshore and offshore resources.”

According to the EIA, renewable energy will displace petroleum as the most-used global energy source in the late 2040s, but oil demand is not expected to peak before 2050.

The forecast sees global renewable energy demand increasing by three per cent per year between 2018 and 2040, driven by electricity demand and government policies.

The EIA expects liquid fuel consumption to decline to 27 per cent as a share of global demand in 2050, from 32 per cent in 2018.

Natural gas is expected to be the world’s fastest-growing fossil fuel out to 2050, with demand rising by 1.1 per cent per year, compared with liquid fuel growth of 0.6 per cent per year and coal growth of 0.4 per cent per year.

The EIA said world residential energy consumption per person (energy intensity) would increase by 0.6 per cent per year from 2018 to 2050, as residential energy consumption (1.4 per cent per year) would grow faster than world population growth (0.7 per cent per year).

It said, “Although residential energy intensity in Africa grows by about 16 per cent from 2018 to 2050, it remains the least energy-intensive region.

“Residential energy consumption in Africa grows by an average of 2.5 per cent per year from 2018 to 2050— which is faster than its population growth of 1.9 per cent per year.”
