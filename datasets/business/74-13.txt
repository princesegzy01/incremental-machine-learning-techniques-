The Chairman, Choice International Group, Chief Diana Chen, advised Nigerian business community and the Organised Private Sector to devise strategies that will enable them to access the $60bn Prosper Africa Initiative and other Global Africa funding for Africa projects and business ventures.

Chen, who is also the Vice Chairman, China-Africa Business Council, said this in Lagos while speaking at the Global Capital Strategy Session 2019 at the Nigerian Stock Exchange.

She said it was time Nigerians moved to access the funding and attract investments to grow and transform businesses and peoples’ lives.

A statement from the CIG quoted her as saying, “This would only take Nigerians to trigger development in the country and not the outside world.”

According to her, the Nigerian business community should immediately come together under one umbrella to invent strategies that would enable them to access the funding seamlessly while also making the best use of the facility.

Nikky Okoye Organisation, facilitators of the Global Capital Strategy Session 2019, titled, ‘$60bn Prosper Africa Initiative and other Global Capital funding for African Prospects and Business Ventures’, said the session was aimed at helping the business community devise technicalities of accessing the funding.

Chinese President XI Jinping last year in Kenya announced the $60bn funding over the next three years at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.

FOCAL is the equivalent of TICAD designed to accelerate China’s engagement with Africa, regarding financial support.
