Benin port to get petroleum products from Dangote jetty
The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki and the President of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, have inspected ongoing work at the Dangote Jetty and Port operated by Dangote Group in Lagos.

The port serves as an inspiration for the Benin River Port, being developed by the Edo State Government and China Harbour Engineering Company Limited, according to a statement from the Edo government house.

The statement quoted the governor as saying that key among the issues discussed during the inspection was how Dangote’s port would be linked to the Benin River Port to supply petrochemical products to the port in Benin.

According to him, the duo discussed areas of cooperation and support for the Benin River Port, which will have facilities to receive products directly from Dangote’s plant.

The Benin River Port is also expected to serve as a sister port to the Lekki Deep Seaport, being developed by China Harbour Engineering Company Limited. The preliminary tests for the Benin port project have been finalised, the statement added.
