A real estate firm, 4point Real Estate Investment Limited, has unveiled an initiative for prospective homeowners, known and ‘Buy and Build’.

The Chief Executive Officer of the firm, Mr Wale Olayanju, said the initiative was introduced to boost investment in its estate, Wealthgate Park in Lekki, comprising land offered as serviced plots for residential use.

“It is an initiative to boost local investment in Nigeria’s real estate industry through the middle-class citizens that constitute over 23 per cent of the nation’s population, thereby creating thousands of jobs and promoting inclusive growth,” he said.

He said it was also intended to allow savvy investors to broaden their property portfolio.

“Building on the antecedent of our past projects, the estate which has verifiable documentation will feature well-planned residential houses, green area with recreational facilities and relaxation centre, waste disposal system, perimeter fencing, 24/7 security, interlocked road, potable water, efficient drainage system and uninterrupted power supply,” he said.

According to him, the estate is currently being developed at a location that has recorded great appreciation in property value over the last few years and will ultimately guarantee a high return on investment to astute investors and subscribers.

Olayanju added that the subscribers to the housing scheme would not have problems with land grabbers or government officials as the company had put plans in place to protect their interests.

He added that all documents regarding ownership were available and would be given to each subscriber upon purchase.
