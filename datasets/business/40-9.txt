MTN, Nestle support World Teachers Day
MTN Nigeria and Nestle Nigeria Plc have supported this year’s celebration of the World Teachers Day.

A statement obtained on Thursday said the companies’ sponsorship of the event held in Ota, Ogun State received the commendation of teachers in state.

The state Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Teachers, Mr Titilope Adebanjo, said though the union went through tough time during the last administration in the state, the present administration under Dapo Abiodun had initiated a good working relationship with them.

He, however, appealed to him to ensure prompt teachers’ promotion; payment of leave grants from 2015 up to date; employment of teachers to replace retired ones in primary and secondary schools, as well as regular release of subventions to schools and unions.

The NUT Chairman for Ado Odo/Ota Local Government Area, Safar Asade, called on the government at all levels to invest more in training and the educational system, especially the training of the teachers, adding that no education system could rise above the quality of its teachers.
