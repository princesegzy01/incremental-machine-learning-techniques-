The Advertisers’ Association of Nigeria says it has made additions to the 18th Annual General Meeting and Marketing Excellence Awards, which will hold in Lagos.

A statement signed by its Executive Secretary, Ediri Ediale, indicated that winners of the Marketing Excellence Awards would now be showcased in the directory of all World Federation of Advertisers’ member companies.

It added that the entries for the awards would now be assessed by local and international assessors, and it would host members’ round-table conference this year.

The statement read in part, “The theme of the AGM is ‘Navigating the Nigerian marketing communications regulatory landscape, while the theme of the awards is ‘Business value of creativity’ where local and international professionals will be sharing insights into the value of creativity.

“The awards offer the ultimate platform for improving brand awareness and loyalty, by increasing the respective recipients’ prestige.

“Awards winners will be acknowledged as industry leaders and named the elite in their industry.”

The event, according to the statement, is the most prestigious and respected awards in the Nigerian marketing community, which provides opportunities for organisations to gain competitive advantage by having their projects, initiatives, contributions, products and services recognised.
