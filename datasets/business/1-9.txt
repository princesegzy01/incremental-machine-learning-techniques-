The Central Bank of Nigeria has endorsed the Association of Corporate Treasurers of Nigeria to boost corporate treasury function in the country.

The Deputy Governor, Economic Policy, CBN, Joseph Nnanna, made this known to the members of the ACTN governing council during their courtesy visit to him in Abuja last week, a statement said on Thursday.

Nnanna, while urging the ACTN to be research oriented, said the association should interface with the CBN in the partnership to boost corporate treasury through its financial markets department.

The Chairman, ACTN governing council, Zeal Akaraiwe, noted that the association could play a vital role in partnering the CBN in the area of providing feedback on policy issues.

He reiterated the value the ACTN could add to the process and quality of policies if CBN could depend on it for certain statistics they would require for more informed policies.

Nnanna said the CBN was trying to de-risk the real sector and expressed willingness to partner with the ACTN in that regard to move the economy forward.
