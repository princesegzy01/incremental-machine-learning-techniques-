The Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, on Monday said the Lagos-Ibadan railway would commence commercial operations by November/December.

During a tour of the rail project being handled by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, the minister, who was accompanied by the Minister of State for Transport, Gbemi Saraki, and the Managing Director, Nigerian Railway Corporation, Fidet Okhiria, said laying of tracks had been completed.

Amaechi said redirecting petroleum pipelines along the construction zone was the most difficult part of the job, adding that the contractor had found a way to manage the situation so as not to shut down the country’s supply of fuel.
