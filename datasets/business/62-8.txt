Laws against building collapse not implemented — Fashola
Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, on Thursday said Nigeria had adequate laws to check the menace of building collapse as well as to prosecute offenders, but noted that many of such laws were not implemented.

Fashola, who said this in his office while playing host to a delegation from the National Building Advisory Committee, led by its Chairman, Mohammed Faworaja, also stated that any individual found culpable in a building collapse incident must be made to face the law.

The minister said, “Anytime it (building collapse) happens like that, somebody must have acted wrongly at the design, materials or any other stage. Let him be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted. At least, such action will make people sit up and do the right thing.”

He noted that the absence of a building code was not a major cause of building collapse.
