38 million Nigerians get national identification numbers
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

Thirty-eight million Nigerians have so far enrolled for the National Identification Number, the National Identity Management Commission has said.

The Director-General of the NIMC, Aliyu Aziz, disclosed this on Monday at a Pre-Bid Conference for Prospective Data Collection Service Providers on the Digital Identity Ecosystem Project.

The Digital Identity Ecosystem Project seeks to license private sector organisations to enrol Nigerians on the NIN, under the supervision of the NIMC.

Currently, the NIMC has about 1,000 enrolment centres spread across the country.

Aziz noted that with the involvement of private service providers in the project, it was expected that the enrolment centres would rise to 10,000.

He said the commission was targeting that all Nigerians would be fully enrolled in the next three years.

“So far, we have enrolled 38 million Nigerians out of 200 million.

“We are licensing the service providers to provide the service and we believe that with our 1,000 centres now, with the private sector coming in, we can have up to 10,000 centres and that means that in any ward, you will be able to have access to enrolment.

“Every enrolment machine is capable of enrolling about 100 people in a day. And it means that in the next three years, we will be able to enrol every person.”

Reacting to the criticism trailing reports that the commission was to charge N3,000 for renewal of the National Identity Card, and N5,000 for its replacement, Aziz explained that the card cost about N3,000 to produce.
