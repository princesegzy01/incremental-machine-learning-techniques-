Oil, gas leaders to discuss human capital devt
Leaders and other stakeholders in the oil and gas industry will converge on Lagos this month to discuss human capital development in Nigeria and other African countries.

The organisers of the Africa Oil & Gas Talent Summit said the annual pan-African meeting of oil and gas business and Human Resources leaders was also designed to help bridge the skills gap in the industry.

The Summit Director, Mr Emmanuel Emielu, said at a press conference in Lagos on Wednesday, “abundance of people does not necessarily mean availability of human capital. It is therefore no surprise that Africa’s oil sector is heavily challenged with the human capacity, skills and expertise to deliver the needed innovation, agility and creativity.

“This why the focus for this year’s event is on how to expedite the transformation of Africa’s “abundant people” into “abundant human capital” for a sustainable Africa oil and gas sector.”

He announced that the conference would take place in the last two days of the month.

Emielu said, “The conference started in 2015 to provide a pan- African platform for prioritising the human capital discourse in Africa’s oil and gas industry, and as a necessary complement to the other events focused on technology, policy and finance. It is people that put technology, policy, and finance to work.”
