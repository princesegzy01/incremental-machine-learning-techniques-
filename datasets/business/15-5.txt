The Head, Africa Region, International Professional Managers Association, United Kingdom, Prof. Taiwo Feyi-Sobanjo, has called on professional managers across the country to remain relevant to the economic growth of the nation by upholding professionalism in their dealings.

According to a statement from the headquarters of IPMA Africa, Feyi-Sobanjo made the call during the 2019 Joint Induction programme of IPMA-UK and International Expert Consultants-UK held in Lagos.

He said, “I encourage us to contribute our quota to the growth of the institution and be good ambassadors in Africa and beyond, by demonstrating and practising our enhanced professional competence that has put us in line with global best practices.

“As professional managers, we must be broad and adventurous and ensure that the interest of our client, employers, and the nation at large is central to our work. We should at all times discharge our allotted and acceptable responsibility with honesty, dignity and integrity to achieve meaningful development.”
