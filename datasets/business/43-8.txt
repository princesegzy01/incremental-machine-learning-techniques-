The nation’s stock market has resumed its losing streak after a one-day break, where investors recorded N11bn gains on Monday.

Investors have counted losses totalling N41bn in two days as the equities market took a fall on Tuesday, extending its losing trend to Wednesday.

At the end of trading on Wednesday, the All Share Index declined by 0.12 per cent to 26,513.65 basis points following major losses posted by MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, Guaranty Trust Bank Plc and Dangote Flour Mills Plc.

Performance across sectors was bearish as four of six sectors recorded losses.

The consumer goods and banking indices emerged the only gainers, up by 0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent, respectively on the back of gains in Nestlé Nigeria Plc, GTB and Fidelity Bank Plc.

On the flip side, the industrial goods index led the laggards, down by one per cent following sell pressures in Lafarge Africa Plc, while the oil and gas index shed 0.3 per cent due to price depreciation in Oando Plc.

Similarly, the insurance and AFR-ICT indices fell by 0.2 per cent on account of sell-offs in Wapic Insurance Plc and MTN Nigeria.
