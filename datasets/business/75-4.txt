Mamador gifts mobile kitchen to graduate food hawker
A graduate food hawker, Josephine Adegahi, whose story went viral on the social media recently, has been located and provided with a mobile kitchen by Mamador, a brand within the PZ Wilmar Food Ltd.

The company said it was doing this under the programme titled Mamador Empowerment Programme, which is geared towards encouraging entrepreneurship among Nigerians within the food sector.

This, it added, was part of its plans to ensure consumers had access to healthy and tasty meals.

The firm said it kick-started this programme with the presentation of the gift to the graduate food hawker in Abuja.

A statement from the company read in part, “The food hawker, Josephine Adegahi, caught the attention of the brand as her story which revealed she was a graduate selling food with the aid of a wheelbarrow, went viral on social media.

“She was subsequently contacted by the Mamador team and gifted a branded Mamador mobile kitchen as well as Mamador products, ranging from the cooking oil to the recently launched seasoning and spread for bread.”

Speaking at the presentation was the Category Development Manager, PZ Wilmar Ltd, Toyin Popoola-Dania, who expressed her delight at the launch of the Mamador Empowerment Programme.

“I am particularly excited at the launch of this programme as it presents another opportunity for Mamador to support individuals and families. The mission of the programme is to provide equipment, products, materials and other support for entrepreneurs within the food sector to help take their businesses to the next level profitably while improving access to healthy and tasty meals among consumers,” she said.

Popoola-Dania also had kind words for the beneficiary of the programme, stating that the brand was impressed by her drive to support herself, her family and improve her standard of living.
