Nigeria to reap benefits of agric investment â€“Minister
Adelani Adepegba, Abuja

The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sambo Nanono, has said that the nation will benefit from the African Continental Free Trade Agreement through the ongoing investment in the agricultural sector.

He said this in Abuja on Monday, during a six-day agriculture technology training programme sponsored by the Embassy of China in Nigeria and organised by Green Agriculture West Africa Limited.

Nanono explained that the trade agreement would give the farmers comparative advantage to market their products, adding that this was the rationale behind the signing of the AfCFTA by President Muhammadu Buhari in July.

The minister, who was represented by the Director, Agribusiness, Processing and Marketing, Alhaji Muyi Azeez, said that the training would help in improving agricultural productivity in the country.

The Managing Director, Green Agriculture West Africa Limited, Mr Wang Jun, said his firm had invested in mechanised farming in Kebbi State with the aim of building a platform for China-Africa agricultural development.
