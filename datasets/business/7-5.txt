Redeemer’s University, Ede, Osun State has given three of its students seed funds to implement their business proposals.

The students were presented their cheques on Thursday during one of the events marking the Bursary Week of the institution.

According to the bursar of the university, Mrs Olutayo David, the gesture is meant to encourage entrepreneurship among students as part of the celebration of the institution’s maiden Bursary Week.

She said the bursary department of the institution, having received business plans from many students, reviewed the proposals and selected the best three.

David said the grant would be used by the beneficiaries to start their businesses, adding that the gesture would encourage the students to acquire skills required to develop new ventures and start-ups such as innovative thinking, business creativity, business planning, proposal writing, risk-taking abilities and business management skills.

She said, “To encourage entrepreneurship, a competition was held among students of the institution where students were urged to develop business proposals.

“Three winners emerged and were presented with the sum of N200,000 as seed money to start or continue their proposed or existing businesses.”
