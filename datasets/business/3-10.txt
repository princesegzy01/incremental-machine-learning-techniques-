The West African Container Terminal operating at Onne, Rivers State has received commendation from freight forwarders for reducing vessel waiting time to zero.

The freight forwarders attributed the performance to improvement in service delivery of the terminal.

WACT also received commendation for its massive investment in cargo handling equipment to take care of growth in container volume at the port.

The firm reportedly invested N5bn in the acquisition of modern cargo handling equipment including two mobile harbour cranes, 14 specialised terminal trucks and two reach stackers, according to a statement.

The Chairman, Association of Registered Freight Forwarders of Nigeria, Onne Port, Gabriel Okonkwo, said, “There has been substantial increase in import volume; and to measure up with that, WACT has acquired a lot of equipment to ease cargo clearance and we commend them for that because they are doing very well.

“Every week, they receive between three and four ships. They are keeping up with the demand. They can receive vessels, do loading and drop containers for examination, all at the same time.”

The Chairman, National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders, Onne Port, Emma Nnwamkpa, said, “WACT is operating very well. They brought new equipment over the last six months; so, we don’t have any delay in working at the facility.”

The Chairman, Flat and Cargo Trailer Drivers Association, Adolphus Ugwu, was also quoted as saying that the upgrade and massive investment at the terminal had brought about high level of efficiency.
