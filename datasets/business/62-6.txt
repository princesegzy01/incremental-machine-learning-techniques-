Let’s sell electricity directly to eligible customers — Gencos
Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja

Power generation companies are pushing for the full implementation of the Eligible Customer policy of the Federal Government following the recent reduction in the payment of their invoices from about 80 per cent to 15 per cent.

On May 15, 2017, the former Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, declared the Eligible Customer policy which permits electricity customers to buy power directly from generation companies in line with the provisions of Section 27 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act 2005.

But industry operators told our correspondent on Thursday in Abuja that the policy had not been fully allowed to take effect.

Also, power generation companies complained that their payments from the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading company for energy delivered to the grid had reduced tremendously, dropping from about 80 to 15 per cent.

The Chairman, Mainstream Energy Solutions Limited, the concessionaire for Kainji and Jebba Hydro Power Plants, Sani Bello, urged the Minister of Power, Sale Mamman, to consider the Eligible Customer initiative as it would also benefit the Federal Government.
