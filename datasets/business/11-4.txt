The Federal Government has raised a fresh alarm on the looming dangers of deforestation across Nigeria as an aftermath of the rampaging climate change.

The Minister of Environment, Dr Mohammad Mahmood, raised the alarm at the opening of the 2019 Farming Systems Annual Workshop at the Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria, Ibadan.

He said, “The major challenges facing the country is how to achieve sustainable food security for a population that is almost 200 million while minimizing further environmental degradation.”

The minister who spoke through the Permanent Secretary, Mrs Ibukun Odusote, said, “Better food system management to reduce food loss and waste is needed in Nigeria by focusing on technical and logistical strategies to reduce post-harvest losses.

He stressed that deforestation was now a visible and pronounced environmental problem in the country.
