Dterling Bank Plc says it is now active in West Africa on SWIFT Global Payments Innovation.

A statement from the bank said the SWIFT GPI improved the customer experience by increasing the speed, transparency and end-to-end tracking of cross-border payments.

The Executive Director, Corporate and Investment Banking, Sterling Bank, Yemi Odubiyi, said the introduction of SWIFT GPI had transformed cross border payments for the benefit of its customers.

Odubiy stated, “As a key player committed to the digital transformation of Nigeria’s financial sector, we have delivered the solution and all its benefits to our customers.

“Sterling is the first bank in Nigeria and West Africa to achieve SWIFT GPI implementation, as this was driven by our commitment to provide faster, transparent and traceable international payments.”

The bank stated that other benefits of SWIFT GPI included, receiving confirmation message when beneficiary had been paid, ensuring remittance data was unchanged when payment arrived at the destination bank, stop and recall – Allowing payment messages to be immediately stopped in case of fraud or error, no matter where they were in the GPI transaction chain.

It added that around 40 per cent of SWIFT GPI payments were credited to end-beneficiaries within five minutes; 50 per cent were credited within 30 minutes; and almost 100 per cent within 24 hours.
