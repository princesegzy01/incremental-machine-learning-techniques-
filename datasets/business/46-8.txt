BATN unveils corporate recycling programme
The British American Tobacco Nigeria says it has unveiled its corporate recycling programme as part of its sustainability week.

The foundation added that it also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a waste recycling company, Recycle Points, for responsible disposal and recycling of BAT’s physical waste through a corporate recycling programme.

The Area Director, BAT West Africa, Yarub Al-Bahrani, was quoted as saying that sustainability was vital to the company’s business and to securing its future.

“On the back of our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the 18th consecutive year and being the only tobacco company to be included in the prestigious World Index, sustainability for us at BAT is not just a buzzword.

“Sustainability is a crucial part of our business and also a key enabler for securing the future of our company and creating shared value for our consumers, our shareholders and our stakeholders,” he said.

Al-Bahrani noted that through the activities lined up for the sustainability week the company had aligned with the global community in commemorating the International World Clean Up Day, a day set aside by over 157 countries and 18 million volunteers worldwide to clean up the planet from waste of different forms.

He noted that as a multinational business, BAT had long been aware of its responsibilities towards harm reduction, responsible corporate behaviour and the need to address environmental issues on a global scale and within its host communities in line with the Sustainable Development Goals.
