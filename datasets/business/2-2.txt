’Femi Asu

Eko Job Centre, a public-private initiative with the Lagos State Ministry of Wealth Creation and Employment, has been launched with the aim of tackling unemployment in the state through the deployment of 20 hubs.

The Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said at the unveiling of the initiative that the deliberate employment intervention policies of the Lagos State Government were significantly impacting on wealth creation.

Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment, Solape Hammond, said the new partnership would help the government to increase its impact.

A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr Folajimi Lai-Mohammed, said, “Today’s event is themed around corporate social responsibility. Basically what we are trying to do is to see how we can put a bill into law whereby we can encourage employers of labour within Lagos State to provide a certain quota of their employment to our job boards in the Ministry of Employment and Wealth Creation.”

Lai-Mohammed, who is the chairman of Eko Job Foundation, said the centre was designed to provide a full range of assistance to job seekers and employers.

He said, “Eko Job Center is aiming to deploy 20 hubs in the main local governments of Lagos. These will serve as a direct contact point for job seekers. The Job Center hub in Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Area is our pilot location and has been successfully deployed and completed.”

According to him, the vision of the job centre is to resolve employment-related issues by bridging the gap between employers and employees in Lagos State.
