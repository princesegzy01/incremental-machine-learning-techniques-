Trading reverses on NSE, up by 0.39 per cent
The crucial market indices of the Nigerian Stock Exchange rebounded on Wednesday with 0.39 per cent after dropping for five trading sessions.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the growth is due to bargain hunting by investors on some middle and large capitalised equities.

Specifically, the All Share Index rose by 105.95 or 0.39 per cent to close at 27,153.53, against 27,047.58 recorded on Tuesday.

Also, the market capitalisation inched up by N52 billion or 0.39 per cent to close at N13.209 trillion in contrast with N13.158 trillion on Tuesday.

The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are Nestle Nigeria, Seplat, Cement Company of Northern Nigeria, May and Baker Nigeria and FCMB Group.

Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said that in spite the positive performance of the benchmark index, they expected market performance to be bearish in subsequent sessions in the absence of any market catalyst.

Nevertheless, they added that they did not rule out the possibility of bargain hunting activities.
