The Nigerian subsidiary of global financial services provider, Old Mutual Limited, says it has commenced a campaign with its new e-commerce website tagged ‘Doing great things is now a click away’, as part of its commitment to helping Nigerians achieve their dreams and plan a positive future.

A statement said the launch of the new e-commerce website was in line with the brand’s commitment to increase insurance penetration in Nigeria by making it more accessible to customers across the country.

It said the new site afforded users the opportunity to easily navigate through Old Mutual’s tailored product offerings and made instant purchase of solutions that aligned with its personal goals, as well as existing customers to make claims.

The Executive Head, Marketing, Old Mutual, Alero Ladipo, noted that launching the revamped website was not only connected with the brand’s drive to deepen insurance penetration in Nigeria, but also intended to increase the accessibility of its insurance solutions to help Nigerians achieve a better and more fulfilling future.

“This website speaks to every Nigerian; we want them to think about the great plans they have for themselves and their families, and to seek the right partner to help them achieve those goals. A great future does not just happen, it results when people make the right plans and have the right protection for those plans.”

She added, “Buying insurance should be an activity that fits into our everyday life and we should be able to purchase insurance ‘on the go’ or make a claim. The claims functionality demystifies the illusion the ‘insurance companies don’t pay claims’.”
