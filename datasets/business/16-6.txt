Feyisayo Popoola5

The Nigerian Stock Exchange has intensified efforts to ensure the security of information in the capital market.

The NSE on Thursday held the 7th edition of its bi-annual Nigerian Capital Market Information Security Forum, themed, ‘The Nigeria data protection regulation: Achieving compliance.’

The one-day event brought together leading industry data privacy and security experts and capital market stakeholders to share actionable information on the prevailing data protection regulation aimed at achieving privacy by default and privacy by design.

The forum also highlighted how organisations could comply with the regulation on an ongoing basis as a means of protecting client data and boosting investor’s confidence.

The Chief Risk Officer, NSE, Mr Rasaq Ozemede, said, “The event provides participants a perfect opportunity to get deeper understanding of present and developing trends in Information Security through case studies.

“Case studies on topics ranging from how industry is redefining their Data Protection Regulation practice to developments in protecting Personally Identifiable Information and data protection regimes.”.
