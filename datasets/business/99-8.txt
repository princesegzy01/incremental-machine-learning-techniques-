‘Business-friendly environment’ll encourage youth entrepreneurship’
Dayo Ojerinde

The Managing Director of Dewdrops Cakes Limited, Mrs Ezinne Okonkwo, has urged the government at state and federal levels to create enabling environment for businesses to thrive.

This, he said, would encourage the youths to shift their attention from hunting for white-collar jobs to entrepreneurship.

Okonkwo at an event organised by her firm tagged, ‘Dewdrops Uncut Learning 2’, said having business-friendly environment would boost the baking industry and youths would meaningfully be engaged.

She said, “My aim is to groom fresh and professional bakers to have all-round knowledge about baking, including the business aspect of baking. The era of seeking white-collar jobs is gone; our youths must be encouraged to be self-reliant and employers of labour. They can only do this if the government creates an enabling environment for them to thrive.”

Okonkwo noted that the baking industry had created employment for many citizens and still had the potential to engage many more.

She added that the industry needed constant supply of electricity and potable water as well as the supply of quality raw materials.

A board member of the Nigerian Association of Cake and Sugarcraft Professionals, Mr Tosan Jemide, urged cake artists to partner to facilitate the growth of the industry.
