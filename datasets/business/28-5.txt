Leoht Africa to hold retail fair
Leoht Africa has revealed plans to hold its retail sourcing fair in Nigeria next month.

The Marketing Manager, Leoht Africa, Tonia Odili, while speaking during a press conference, said the retail fair focused on establishing a presence for manufacturers in key markets on the continent.

She said the company aimed to provide route to market, market penetration and expansion strategies for manufacturers.

She said, “As a leading consultant in this region, we have worked with many of the leading global and regional players. We bring our clients an unparalleled understanding of the global industry and regional markets.

“Over the past years, we have successfully collaborated and worked with trade promotion organisations from across the world exclusively in sub-Saharan Africa, offering insight and access into African markets and help increase exports and build sustainable business partnerships throughout sub-Saharan Africa.”

Odili noted that the company had monitored the growth of independent market retailers and the retail sector in Nigeria, which was recognised by the Global Retail Index as the largest retail market in sub-Saharan Africa with retail sales of $185bn in 2018.

She stated that the show would focus exclusively on connecting Nigerian and Chinese businesses, government’s bodies and institutions to have in-depth onsite discussions on investments, business and trade opportunities.

According to her, the introduction to Nigeria of the China Brand Show is a major feat for local businesses.
