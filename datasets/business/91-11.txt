FG seeks food security through biotechnology
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

The Federal Government on Tuesday said it planned to harness genetic engineering and biotechnology in efforts to ensure food security in the country.

Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, said this while declaring open a training workshop on Living Modified Organisms Detection and Identification organised by the National Biotechnology Development Agency in Abuja.

Onu said the Federal Government also planned to harness genetic engineering and biotechnology to improve food safety in the country.

The Federal Government has recognised the immense importance of genetic engineering and biotechnology to national development, the minister noted.

According to him, effective application of genetic engineering and biotechnology will boost local production of food, and as a result, minimise the need for continuous import.
