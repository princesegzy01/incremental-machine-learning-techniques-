Dufil Prima Foods Plc, makers of Indomie Instant Noodles, in continuation of its renowned Corporate Social Responsibility initiative for children, has unveiled and rewarded three more heroes as winners of the 2019 Indomie Independence Day Awards.

The organisers said each awardee went home with a cash scholarship fund of N1m.

Additional donations were said to have come from kindhearted individuals and corporate organisations.

“With the emergence of this year’s set of winners, a total of 42 winners have now been rewarded over the 12 year existence of the initiative,” Dufil Prima added.

The award is in three categories — physical, social and intellectual bravery categories.

Thirteen-year old YahayaZaki from Sokoto State, who risked his life entering into a well to save a young girl who had slipped and fell inside, won the physical bravery category.

Winning the intellectual bravery category was a 14- year old aspiring mechanical engineer, Anthony Lawrence, from Umuokpara Dibia Okohia, Isiala Mbano Local Government Area of Imo State. He won for constructing a functioning prototype police patrol van using old carton boxes, glue and electronic components salvaged from the waste bin; truly demonstrating the ingenuity of a Nigeria child.

The third winner, Kanyeyachukwu Tagbo-Okeke is an autistic artist who helps other autistic kids by raising awareness about autism.

Kanye, a nine-year old who lives in Maitama, Abuja also won the sum of N1m scholarship award in the social bravery category.
