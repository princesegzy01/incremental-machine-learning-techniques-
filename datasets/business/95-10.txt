The use of Liquefied Petroleum Gas, popularly known as cooking gas, has been growing steadily as its consumption in Nigeria hit 78,000 metric tonnes in July, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency announced on Sunday.

According to the Executive Secretary, PPPRA, Abdulkadir Saidu, who announced this in a statement on Sunday, the increase in the LPG consumption showed that more Nigerians were beginning to appreciate the usefulness of cooking gas, as opposed to the use of kerosene or firewood.

He said, “While domestic utilisation ranged between 40,000MT and 54,000MT from January to April 2018, the July 2019 monthly utilisation rose to 78,000MT.

“This figure is expected to increase in the months ahead as some of government and industry initiatives take root.”

Saidu said the use of kerosene had witnessed considerable drop following the switch to cooking gas by citizens across the country.

He noted that the growth in the LPG utilisation was in fulfilment of the vision of the government on deepening its consumption across the country as encapsulated in the National Gas Policy 2017.
