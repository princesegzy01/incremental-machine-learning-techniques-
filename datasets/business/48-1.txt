La Casera rewards customers in new promo
La Casera Company has launched its Refresh and Connect promo, saying the move was to reward its customers.

The Managing Director of the company, Mr Chinedum Okereke, said it was in the culture of the company to carry its stakeholders and customers along.

He said the company started in 2001 with 100 bottles per minute, translating to an annual production capacity of about 50 million bottles, but that with its current 2,000 bottles per minute, the company “now has an installed capacity of a billion bottles per annum.”

While explaining how customers could win, the Group Portfolio Manager, Onyekachi Okoli, said customers should buy the bottles with yellow cap and that they should send the code under the cap to the designated number through SMS or WhatsApp.

He said there was instant airtime to be won and that when they send a cumulative of 10 entries, they stand a chance to win at the regional draws. “The more the entries the higher the chance of winning,” he added.

He listed the items to be won to include sound systems, phones, televisions and smart watches.

The company noted that the promo, which was already on, would end in December.

Present at the event were representatives of the Lagos State Lotteries Board, Consumer Protection Council, National Lottery Regulatory Commission customers and other stakeholders.
