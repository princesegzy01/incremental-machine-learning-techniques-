NorthFest to eradicate poverty, boost food production
Ada Wodu, Calabar

The Northern Cultural Festival organised annually by the Cross River State Government is to boost tourism, eradicate poverty through employment creation and drive food production in the state.

This was disclosed in Calabar by an aide to Governor Ben Ayade and Chairman, Central Planning Committee of the festival, Kenneth Aklah.

According to him, the introduction of new prizes such as the prize for ‘Best Agric Innovation Machine’, will invariably cause the people to unleash their potential in agricultural machine fabrication thereby reducing the man-hour in the agriculture value chain.

“Besides, this will translate to increased food production. This award is simply an addition to existing prizes for the best harvester, NorthFest king and queen, best traditional wrestler, and the best palm wine tapper.

“The state government has also concluded plans to buy off all surplus farm produce displayed at the festival mini-market to check post-harvest losses.”

Aklah said the theme for this year’s edition, which is ‘Humanity: Uniting the people, increasing production’, “presupposes that humanity is the centre piece of all the endeavours, be it in tourism, industrialisation, agriculture, etc. When the people are united, they can form a formidable front to be resourceful in their agriculture production and other spheres of human enterprise.”

This year’s edition of the festival which comes up on November 30, involves the usual five local government areas that comprise the Northern Senatorial District, Ogoja, Yala, Bekwara, Obanliku and Obudu.
