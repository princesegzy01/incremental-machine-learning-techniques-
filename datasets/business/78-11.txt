Samson Folarin

The Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Fredrick Oladeinde, has said the December deadline set for the completion of the Kara-Berger reconstruction of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway is possible.

He urged motorists to be patient, adding that agencies of government were working round the clock to ease traffic in the area.

Oladeinde spoke on Tuesday during a visit to the construction area.

He explained that the state government was interested in the project because it affected people living in the state.

He said, “This is a border area between Lagos and Ogun states. Our concern is to see how the agencies are working together; the Federal Road Safety Corps, the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority and the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps.

“It is important that they work harmoniously to ensure there is free flow of traffic. All hands are on deck; the December deadline is quite realistic. We will do our best to ensure that by December, it is completed.”

According to Oladehinde, the issue of transport affects every member of society.

He explained that the state government believed that if everyone did business with ease, the economy of the state would be positively impacted.
