Effects of insecurity on banking worry experts
Nike Popoola

The President/Chairman of Council, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, Dr Uche Olowu, has said insecurity in some parts of the country, which is spreading fast to other parts, has affected the banking business and operations.

He spoke at the 2019 annual corporate dinner organised by the Association of Professional Women Bankers, the women wing of the CIBN in Lagos, with the theme, ‘Security and development: Impact on socio-economic development’.

The event was attended by young and professional bankers and other relevant stakeholders in the economy.

He stated, “There is no doubt, insecurity has severe impact on the banking business. It scares foreign investors, limits business opportunities in certain parts of the country and paints the general unstable nature of Nigeria.

“Insecurity has been a matter of concern to Nigeria. Kidnapping for ransom, insurgent groups such as Boko Haram, armed robbery, banditry and other associated violent crimesseem to have become commonplace in Nigeria. The value of human life has been so greatly degraded that news of death often on an industrial scale hardly elicits much devotion anymore.”

Olowu charged female bankers to expand the frontiers of the industry to the next generation of female bankers with the tools and capacities to succeed, notwithstanding insecurity challenges in the country.

A member of the Economic Advisory Team of President Buhari and Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Financial Derivatives, Bismarck Rewane, traced the problem of security and development today to some economic fundamental problems.
