Ikeja Electric Plc has inaugurated its franchise centres at six locations as part of its strategy to improve service delivery to customers.

The locations, Olowora, Ikosi, Arepo, Bariga, Ketu and Ogudu, are within the Shomolu Business Unit of the power distribution company.

The Ikeja Electric Franchise project is a business strategy aimed at facilitating improved engagements and customer experience for immediate resolution of complaints, in partnership with the firm’s corporate partners, according to a statement.

It said the project would further be extended across the company’s network coverage area, and assist in creating employment opportunities for Nigerians.

The Chief Operating Officer, IE, Mrs Folake Soetan, said the newly inaugurated franchises would increase the Ikeja Electric brand visibility and cater for the increasing customer base across the Shomolu Business Unit as well as serve as data-gathering centres for its customers.

“Ikeja Electric will work closely with the franchisees to ensure the standards set by the company to provide excellent customer service and satisfaction is maintained by the franchisees,” she added.

According to her, the strategy is a veritable model for creating employment opportunities in line with the company’s support for nation building, which ultimately translates to economic prosperity.

“We are also passionately positioning the company in providing corporate support to fulfil the government’s aspiration towards creating employment opportunities, and this we believe is in line with our social responsibilities as a corporate entity,” Soetan said.
