Nike Popoola

Anchor Insurance Company Limited says it is committed to promoting Nigerian culture.

The company said it would support the National Festival of Arts and Culture which would be hosted by Edo State.

The Managing Director of the company, Mr Ebose Augustine, stated, “As a corporate citizen with high respect for social responsibility, we see it as an honour on us to support events of this sort which aim at restoring and keeping our culture as a people.

“This support is one of our ways of giving back to the society as it is the society that has ensured our continued success through their patronage. It is, therefore, not out of place to give the support we could to ensure the success of the festival.”
