The Nigerian Stock Exchange and the Credit Bureau Association of Nigeria have renewed the call for an unhindered access to credit facilities by the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises in Nigeria in order to unlock growth and development of the sector.

The Head, Trading Business, NSE, Mr Jude Chiemeka, while receiving the delegates of the CBAN on Monday, said that the MSMEs needed an improved credit reporting to access capital for the various projects.

According to him, the MSME sector is the backbone of major developed economies, as well as important contributors to employment, economic and export growth.

Chiemeka added that MSMEs accounted for over 80 per cent of businesses and more than 70 per cent of employment in Nigeria.

He noted that despite the significant contribution of MSMEs to the Nigerian economy, challenges still persisted that hindered the growth and development of the sector as they found it difficult to access credit facilities to expand and grow their business.

He said, “The Nigerian Stock Exchange is fully committed to ensuring that the MSMEs, which are the engine room for Nigerian economic development, have long-term access to finance as it has set in motion a modality to achieve this objective.”

The Chairman, CBAN, Mrs Jameelah Sharrieff-Ayedun, said there was a need to promote and encourage MSMEs in Nigeria by providing enabling environment where they could have access to affordable credit.
