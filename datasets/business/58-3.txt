The non-performing loans obtained by stakeholders in agriculture and manufacturing sectors from the banks stood at N159.24bn as of the end of June.

Figure of non-performing loans in agriculture stood at N48.2bn, while the figure for manufacturing stood at N111.04bn, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

The Central Bank of Nigeria had, however, said it was putting in place measures to ensure that the non-performing loans in the banking sector did not rise as it moves to increase lending to the retail segment of the economy through its Loan to Deposit Ratio mandate.

The Deputy Governor, CBN, Aishah Ahmad, said it was not unaware of banks’ appetite to lend, especially, where they had customers that willfully refused to repay their loans.

The deputy governor mentioned that the CBN was looking into the challenges of the banks’ ability to lend.

She said, “It is that risk aversion, and how do you solve that risk aversion? By ensuring that banks have a framework that they can rely on that when we pay this money out, the monies will come back.

“We all know what happened when we had high NPL the other time and we all know what is at stake. We do not want that by the pronouncement of banks to raise LDR to 60 per cent to raise that NPL ratio again.”

She said the operators were concerned about the level of credit in the industry, and the need to use expanded credit facilities to grow the small and medium enterprises, and the mortgage sector.

It was relevant to revitalise the economy by stimulating demand, and expanding opportunities for businesses that served in this sector, she noted.
