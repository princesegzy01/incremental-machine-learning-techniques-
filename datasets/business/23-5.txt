The Managing Director, Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation, Umaru Ibrahim, says the regulatory organisation plans to reposition for better performance going forward.

He said this during the dinner organised to mark the corporation’s 30th anniversary in Lagos.

Many dignitaries, financial sector leaders and traditional rulers attended the event.

While speaking on future plans, he said, “These 30 years serve as a reflection of what we are, where we are coming from and the need to reposition the corporation.”

He said it was aware of the daunting challenges but the organisation would continue to do its best on how it managed operational risks.

He added that changing customer preference, poverty in the society and unemployment among other issues should be addressed as they affected the banking sector.

He said the corporation was also aware of the impact of fintech on the economy and it was advancing on technology adoption.

“In the last 10 years, we have recruited hundreds of talented young men and women in the digital age, and they are being trained to face emerging challenges,” he said.

He added that the organisation was getting the younger ones to imbibe excellence and professionalism.

According to him, the NDIC was also accelerating human capacity development with the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.
