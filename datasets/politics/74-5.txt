Senator seeks new method to tackle insecurity
James Abraham, Jos

The Senator representing Plateau North in the National Assembly, Istifanus Gyang, has challenged the federal and state governments in the country to come up with new and modern approaches to address insecurity.

Gyang, who is the Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Defence, also said the current security challenge could have been curtailed if drastic measures had been taken by the government few years ago.

The Senator, according to a statement in Jos on Sunday by his media aide, Musa Ashoms, stated this at the burial of Josephine Zih, the mother of Mr Dalyop Dung, who was the Chief Security Officer to former Governor Jonah Jang.

The lawmaker said, “Many years ago, the people of Plateau were under the intense pressure of insecurity. Villages were invaded and burnt, places of worship were bombed, civilians and uniformed forces were killed. But little was done. In fact, many people across the nation thought that this was merely our problem in Plateau State.

“Look at what we have today in Sokoto, Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina; the whole of the North East.

“What if the situation in Plateau was quickly and efficiently handled? We would have contained the situation and prevented it from lasting this long.”
