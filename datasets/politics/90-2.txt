Osun poll: Iâ€™m being persecuted, says Adeleke
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the September 2018 Osun State governorship poll, Senator Ademola Adeleke, on Friday said the dismissal of a case of certificate forgery involving him had confirmed that he was being persecuted by his opponents.

Adeleke recalled how he was detained following an allegation he forged the West African School Certificate he submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission ahead of the governorship election eventually won by Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress.

He alleged that he was a victim of blackmail by people afraid of his popularity in the state.
