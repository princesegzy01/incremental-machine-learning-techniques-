No tax increment, says Oyo
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The Oyo State Government has assured the people of the state that the current administration would not increase tax on business enterprises.

The Executive Chairman, Oyo State Internal Revenue Service, Mr John Adeleke, stated this in a chat with journalists in his office.

He explained that Governor Seyi Makinde was applying sympathy and empathy in his dealings with the matter since the new administration came to office.

Adeleke said the government was working to capture other areas that had not been explored to generate more revenue into the coffers of the state.

He said, “Instead of tax increment, we are emphasising efficient collection of existing revenue and we are bringing our informal sector into the tax net.

“Besides, we are reaching out to other geopolitical zones in our tax campaign. The good performance of Governor Seyi Makinde has also changed the attitude of the stakeholders towards tax payment.”

Adeleke explained further that those who were reluctant to respond were being served reminders after which thorough enforcement would follow.
