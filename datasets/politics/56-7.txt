APC insists on using direct primary in Bayelsa
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The All Progressives Congress will use direct mode of primary in Bayelsa State for the rescheduled governorship primary, The PUNCH has learnt.

Recall that a Bayelsa State High Court sitting in Yenagoa had on Wednesday granted an interim order restraining the APC from adopting direct primary for the rescheduled governorship primary.

Justice E. G. Omukoro granted the order upon hearing a motion ex parte moved by the applicant’s counsel, Gideon Elebe, before fixing September 6 for hearing.

The applicants are Japan Christopher, Evinson Oyindeyinfa, Oddu Ovinmiebi and Obiriki Isaiah.

But findings by our correspondent on Monday indicated that the party had made up its mind to embark on the exercise using direct primary as agreed at a stakeholders’ meeting in Bayelsa and communicated to the APC national secretariat.

The APC Zonal Chairman in South-South, Ntufam Etta, confirmed this to our correspondent on Monday. He said the party would use the direct mode of primary as planned.

“The court cannot dictate to us the mode of primary to use. The Electoral Act and the constitution of the country do not allow a court to dictate to a political party what mode of primary to use,” he said.

Recall that the National Working Committee of the APC had postponed the governorship primary in Bayelsa State till today (Tuesday) and tomorrow (Wednesday).

It had earlier fixed last Saturday for the primary after the initial postponement from August 29.

The APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, in a statement on Friday said the change of date was due to a court order.
