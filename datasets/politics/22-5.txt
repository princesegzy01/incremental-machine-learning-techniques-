The Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Bagudu, has expressed its readiness to tackle security challenges across the state.

Bagudu, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Alhaji Samaila Dabai, said this during a visit to Tafkin Kada village of the Jega Local Government Area of the state on Thursday.

Bagudu, while addressing the combined security personnel including the army, police and vigilante group, urged them to be vigilant while he sought cooperation from the general public.

The governor said, “We are ready to provide the necessary support needed by security agencies to improve their operations.”

Earlier this week, the state government restated its commitment to partner neighbouring Sokoto and Zamfara states to tackle security challenges.
