INEC trains visually-impaired voters in Braille ballot
the Independent National Electoral Commission says it has commenced the training of visually-impaired voters on how to use Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses on election day.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that INEC Director in charge of civil society organisations, Mrs Dorothy Bello, stated this while speaking at the opening of the training/sensitisation workshop in Lokoja on Monday.

The director, however, said that the training was designed for visually-impaired voters not well versed in the use of Braille.

She said the training was necessary because of the realisation that voting could be particularly difficult for the visually-impaired voters, adding that ballot papers were not produced with their disability in mind.

Bello further said the efforts would help in reducing the number of invalid votes among the visually-impaired electorate.

She said, “The move will also guarantee their rights to vote independently and secretly as required by the law.”

The Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Prof. James Apam, said participants at the training were selected from across the 21 local government areas of the state.

Apam expressed the confidence that all the visually-impaired registered voters would be trained before the election day with the help of civil society organisations.

The state Chairman of the Joint Association of People Living With Disabilities, Mr Solomon Yahaya, described the exercise as timely, saying it would ensure full participation of visually- impaired voters in the election.
