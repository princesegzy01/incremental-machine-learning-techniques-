Stop Obaseki, lose Edo, South-South – Oshiomhole ex-aide
Sola Shittu, Benin

A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Charles Idahosa, on Tuesday warned that any attempt by the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, to circumvent the 2020 re-election bid of Governor Godwin Obaseki may spell doom for the APC in Edo State and the South-South region.

Idahosa who was a former political adviser to Oshiomhole, stated this while addressing journalists ahead of activities marking his 66th birthday.

He said, “Nobody can push him (Obaseki) out of this party except they want to finish the APC in the South-South and South-East. As we speak now, only Edo State is being governed by an APC government.

“If by any act of omission or commission, they push him out of the party, that is the end of it,”

Idahosa said the reason behind the crisis between Obaseki and Oshiomhole was purely based on envy and jealousy.

He said, “I have said it before that Oshiomhole brought the Deputy Governor, Secretary to the State Government, chairman and secretary of the party in the state. All these are not hearsay.

However, in a swift reaction, a former commissioner and member-elect of the state House of Assembly, Washington Osa-Osifo, faulted Idahosa’s assertions about Oshiomhole.

He said, “Governor Obaseki is a victim of wicked advisers with very inordinate ambition which will not benefit him and his government.
