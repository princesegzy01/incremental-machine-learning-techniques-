Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Federal Road Maintenance Agency, Femi Bamisile, on Thursday, assured Nigerians of a workable and unambiguous 2020 budget.

Bamisile, who said improper planning, inadequate implementation or non-implementation of budgetary provisions in the past had been the bane of Nigerians, stated that the current legislators would do everything possible to give Nigerians better governance.

The lawmaker, in a statement said the All Progressives Congress-dominated legislative arm would ensure “governance that will alleviate their sufferings and reduce the poverty level in the country.”

He added, “There is no doubt that people are still passing through a lot of hardship now, but the development will soon become a thing of the past. Many budgets in the past could not be implemented due to improper scrutiny by the legislators at either federal or state levels.”
