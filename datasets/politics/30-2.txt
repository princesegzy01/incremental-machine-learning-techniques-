Teachers shortage hits Niger
Enyioha Opara, Minna

Nigeria Union of Teachers on Monday raised the alarm over the shortage of teachers in Niger State.

The state Chairman of the union, Ibrahim Umar, told newsmen in Minna, the situation was giving the union serious concern.

He said, “We are therefore making a passionate appeal to the state Universal Basic Education Board to expedite action towards ensuring that the affected teachers are paid their entitlements without much delay.

“In the same vein, we equally appeal to the Ministry of Education to swiftly act towards ensuring that the affected secondary school teachers newly employed in 2018 are paid their six months’ salary arrears.”

The Chairman commended Governor Abubakar Bello for his efforts towards reviving the teaching profession in the state through the establishment of Niger State Teachers Development Institutes across the three senatorial zones in the state.
