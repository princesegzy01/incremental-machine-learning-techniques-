Umahi flayed for harassing Buhari’s critics
Friday Olokor, Abuja

The Organisation of Ebonyi State Indigenes in Diaspora on Monday berated Governor Dave Umahi for banning his aides from criticising President Muhammadu Buhari, saying he should stop such intimidation.

The organisation said the gag order not only demonstrated the governor’s lack of any clear grasp of the Nigerian constitution, “but also brings to the fore his thoughtless sycophancy and ignominious search for the attention and gratuitous commendation.”

Umahi had through his aide on New Media, Francis Nwanze, warned his aides to either refrain from making any uncomplimentary remarks against Buhari or his government, or face outright dismissal.

But the spokesperson for the OESID, Paschal Oluchukwu, in a statement in Abuja said it was the right of every citizen of Nigeria to hold and express their opinion in line with the 1999 constitution as amended.
