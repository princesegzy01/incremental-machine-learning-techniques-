SAMPSON ITODE

A Rivers State High Court, sitting in Port Harcourt, has restrained the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State from conducting its ward, local government area and state congresses scheduled for September 17, 21 and 28, respectively.

The court on Thursday ordered the party to refrain from conducting the congresses pending the hearing and determination of a suit filed by Ibrahim Umah and 22 others marked, PHC/3098/19.

The interim injunction also ordered the state chapter of the APC, which is the defendant in the suit as well as the claimant (Ibrahim Umah and 22 others) to maintain the status quo pending the determination of the matter before the court.

The order read in part, “An order is hereby made that all parties in this case do maintain the status quo in relation to the subject matter of the proceedings in the suit pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction in the suit.

“An order of interim injunction restraining the defendant (APC), whether by its officers, agents, committees, nominees etc. from conducting ward, LGA and state congresses in Rivers scheduled for September 17, 21 and 28 2019, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.”
