Oluwo seeks stricter laws against ritual killings
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, on Tuesday called for strict laws against ritual killings to protect lives.

The royal father, in a statement by his press secretary, Alli Ibraheem, lamented government’s inability to tackle the menace of ritual killings, saying it was deadlier than kidnapping.

Oluwo said, “It is saddening that no attention is paid by the Federal Government to the prevalence of ritual killings pervading our country. Thousands fall victim of ritual killings on a daily basis but regrettably, no one condemns it.

“I am not happy with the neglect of my outcry on the daily killings of my sons and daughters by ritualists. I will lead thousands of Nigerians with like minds on national protest against human ritualists and corrupt individuals.”
