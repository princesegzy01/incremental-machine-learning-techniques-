Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has alleged that the All Progressives Congress is preparing to unleash mayhem and manipulate the processes and outcome of the forthcoming November 16 governorship election

Dickson, who spoke during a live media chat, claimed that the APC did not have what it takes to win any election under a peaceful and democratic atmosphere in the state.

The governor, according to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, insisted that the Peoples Democratic Party would beat its major opposition to retain political control in the state in the poll as it had always done.

He dismissed allegations of hobnobbing with the APC, adding that, as a “politician of conviction he will continue to play opposition politics for as long as possible.”

Dickson, however, noted that he acted in the best interest of the state and the Ijaw nation by congratulating some APC chieftains of Bayelsa extraction on their appointments at the federal level, including Senator Heineken Lokpobiri and former Governor Timipre Sylva. The governor urged Sylva, who is the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources.
