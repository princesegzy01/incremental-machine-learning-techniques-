Tribunal upholds Oduah’s election
Tony Okafor, Awka

The National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Awka, the Anambra State capital, on Thursday, affirmed Senator Stella Oduah of the Peoples Democratic Party as the winner of the election into the Anambra North Senatorial District held on February 23.

The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared Oduah the winner of the poll, but Dr Chinedu Emeka of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, dragged her before the tribunal to challenge her victory .

Emeka alleged that Oduah was not qualified to contest the election because she did not possess the required academic qualifications.

Emeka, who was a former deputy governor of the state, also contended that by the time of the election, Oduah was a member of the APGA.

He maintained that Oduah’s emergence as the winner of the poll was incongruous to the provisions of the Electoral Act.

However, in the judgement that lasted about four hours, the Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Esther Haruna, affirmed that Oduah, a former minister of Aviation, was validly elected in the poll.
