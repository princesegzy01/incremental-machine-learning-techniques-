Ministerial nomination: Akeredolu urges Senate to ignore call opposing Alasoadura
Peter Dada, Akure

The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has expressed his support for the nomination of Senator Tayo Alasoadura as a member of the Federal Executive Council.

Alasoadura, who represented the Ondo Central Senatorial District between 2015 and 2019, is one of the those nominated for ministerial positions by President Muhammadu Buhari.

In a statement, issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Segun Ajiboye, on Saturday, the governor also appealed to the upper chamber of the National Assembly to ignore a call from a group against the nomination of Alasoadura. He described the group as faceless.

The statement read in part, “For emphasis, the so-called group is not just faceless, it is a divisive aberration unknown to all legitimate organs of the All Progressives Congress. To say the least, the group merely exits in the hallucinating minds of a few individuals who have surrendered themselves to ignoble self-abnegation.

“The governor considers the call for the withdrawal of Alasoadura’s nomination as a contrived distraction which stands logic on its head. For the records, Alasoadura, who served meritoriously as a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is one of the few enviable brains behind the Petroleum Industry and Governance Bill, which currently awaits presidential assent.

“Mr. Governor believes strongly that not only APC, but the entire citizenry in the state will derive maximum benefit from his stay at the Federal Executive Council. There could not have been a better ministerial nominee from the APC in Ondo State than Alasoadura at the moment.”
