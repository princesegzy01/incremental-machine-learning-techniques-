Our agents were chased away from polling units in Borno – PDP agent
Ade Adesomoju, Abuja

The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal in Abuja resumed sitting on Monday with the Peoples Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, calling their 37th petitioners’ witness.

The petitioners are challenging the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress at the February 23, 2019 poll.

The Independent National Electoral Commission, Buhari and the APC are the 1st to the 3rd respondents in the petition.

The petitioners at the Day 8 of the presentation of their case on Monday, presented as their 37th witness, Babagana Kukawa, who served as the Local Government Area collation agent at Kukawa Local Government Area of Borno State during the presidential poll.

Under cross-examination by the respondents’ lawyers, Kukawa said the election in the 131 polling units in the local government area held in one place, making it possible for him to visit all of them.

He said the agents of the PDP, in connivance with the agents of APC, Buhari, INEC and security agencies, chased his party’s agents from the polling units.

He said, “The security personnel, in connivance with the 2nd and 3rd respondents and officials of INEC, chased away our agents.”

When asked, he however, said he was not chased away.

He also alleged that “votes were not counted when it was realised that the petitioners had the upper hand.

“They did not count the votes at the unit and wards,” he said.

He said his polling agents did not sign the Form EC8A, the polling unit result sheets, “because they were chased away”.

But he said he signed the Form EC8C, the local government result sheet, at the local government area collation centre in order to be able to collect a copy as evidence.
