Ondo 2020 election’ll be easy for us, says APC
Peter Dada, Akure

The All Progressives Congress in Ondo State has declared that the forthcoming governorship election will be an easy ride for the party, saying the government of the ruling party had performed well in the last two and a half years.

This came within 24 hours that the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last governorship election, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, declared his intention to recontest against Mr Rotimi Akeredolu in the 2020 election.

The state Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr Alex Kalejaiye, in a statement on Wednesday, said the people of the state were happy with the APC-led administration.

Kalejaiye stated that, contrary to reports, the party was not factionalised or divided.

According to him, the APC is waxing stronger daily, which will make it difficult for the opposition to overthrow the government in the next year election.

The statement read in part, “The state executive is not factionalised nor disenchanted with a government that has made the party proud, and created an atmosphere of confidence and trust between government and the governed.

“The State Working Committee, for example, is deeply preoccupied with its continuous duty of ensuring, and sustaining oneness and unity of members without prejudice. The SWC has no regard for camps or groups.

“The APC-led government has never slacked in the construction of quality roads, provision of potable water, massive investment in agriculture and the health sector, and creation of industrial hubs in the state.
