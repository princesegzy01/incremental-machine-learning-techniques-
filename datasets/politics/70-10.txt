The statement explained that Omo-Agege urged all citizens to continue to work for the peace, unity and progress of the country.

He said, “You know it has not been very easy for us as a country in terms of the challenges we face.

“This notwithstanding, Mr President has managed to steer the ship of the state very successfully; so, we decided to visit him at home.

“It (the visit) is also to reassure him that going forward, the National Assembly is ready to provide the enabling environment for the contents of the Next Level agenda to be implemented.”
