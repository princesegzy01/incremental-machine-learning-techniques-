‘APC’ll rule beyond 2023’
The Speaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Alhaji Ibrahim Abdullahi, has said the All Progressives Congress will rule Nigeria beyond 2023 as President Muhammadu Buhari is laying a solid foundation for the party and the country.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Abduallahi stated this on Wednesday in his country home, Umaisha, Nasarawa State, while fielding questions from journalists.

He added that Buhari would complete his eight-year tenure in 2023 and “by then, he would have laid a solid foundation for the country and the party.

“By the end of President Buhari’s tenure, I assure you that he will have already laid a solid foundation for the party, the country and whoever is coming will follow his footsteps.

“So, I can assure you that, in fact, the APC will survive beyond 2023; there is no doubt about it,” he said.
