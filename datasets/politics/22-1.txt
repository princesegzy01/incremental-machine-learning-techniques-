Dickson’s commissioner resigns over ‘political uncertainty’
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Bayelsa State Commissioner for Mineral Resources, Mr Markson Fefegha, has resigned his appointment in the administration of Governor Seriake Dickson.

Fefegha resigned his appointment in a letter dated October 2, 2019, addressed to the governor.

The commissioner, who had served in the administration since 2012, stated in the letter that his quitting Dickson’s government would take effect from Friday, October 18, 2019.

He described himself as one of the “first 11” in the restoration government of Dickson, having previously manned the ministries of information, education, and later served as Principal Executive Secretary to the governor before his deployment to the Ministry of Mineral Resources.

Fefegha is the first known commissioner to leave the Dickson-led administration since it was hit by a gale of defections by political appointees ahead of the November 16 governorship election.

He, however, did not indicate in his letter if he had defected, like some other aides who joined the All Progressives Congress.

Fefegha said, “After a period of deep reflection, I have decided to quit due to political uncertainty and other reasons personal to me. I hope to dedicate my life and energy to other assignments that will be more acceptable to God and humanity in the near future.”
