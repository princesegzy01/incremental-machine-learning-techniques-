Edo crisis: Oshiomhole’s ex-aide reports Obaseki to CCT
John Mayaki, a former Chief Press Secretary to Edo State Governor Adams Oshiomhole, has lodged a case at the Code of Conduct Tribunal over alleged abuse of office and breach of the constitution by Governor Godwin Obaseki, his deputy Philip Shaibu and the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie.

Mayaki is protesting against the controversial inauguration of the 7th Edo House of Assembly in which nine members-elect out of 24 were inaugurated.

Mayaki, who frowned on the development, insisted Obaseki did not follow due process in his proclamation for the inauguration of the Assembly.

He declared the inauguration illegal, calling for “a fresh, proper proclamation for an all-inclusive inauguration of the House”.

He said, “The Governor of Edo State and others mentioned have jointly and severally abused their office by engaging in arbitrary acts by excluding 14 elected members of the EDHA from participating in the first session of the House of Assembly held on June 17, 2019.

“Clandestinely issuing a proclamation without notice to 14 elected members of the EDHA and the general public is prejudicial to the rights of any other person knowing that such an act is unlawful and contrary to government policy.”

He urged Obaseki, his deputy and the SSG to comply with the resolutions of the National Assembly directing the governor to issue a fresh proclamation for the inauguration of the Assembly in accordance with Section 105(3) of the 1999 Constitution.”

Mayaki called for the application of the laws stipulating punishment for public officers guilty of abuse of office and breach of the constitution.

He said, “If successful, this could see the governor and the other listed officers removed from office and barred from holding any other public office for a period of 10 years.”
