Umahi suspends aide for lack of seriousness
Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has suspended his Special Assistant on Project Monitoring (Ebonyi South Zone), Mr Felix Otah.

Dr Kenneth Ugbala, the Secretary to the State Government, said in a statement on Monday, that Otah was suspended for “lack of commitment and seriousness in discharging his duties.’’

He said, “The SA is therefore directed to hand over all government property in his possession to the office of the SSG.

“This should be on or before the close of work on Tuesday, August 27, 2019.”

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Otah was the second aide of the governor to be suspended since the inauguration of the State Executive.
