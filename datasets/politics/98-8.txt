The immediate past Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh, has thrown his weight behind the governorship ambition of former Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri.

Ogbeh, who was in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, on Saturday, to inaugurate the campaign office of Lokpobiri, said the aspirant had the capacity to rescue Bayelsa from what he described as years of political maladministration.

Addressing a crowd of the All Progressives Congress’ members who converged on the Heineken Lokpobiri Campaign Organisation office, Ogbe, who is a former PDP Chairman, said the former minister was the best for the state.

He said, “He has experience, he has knowledge, he has intelligence and let me tell you that while we were both in the agric ministry, we were always discussing the big problem of Nigeria.

“If you give this young man a chance, I believe he will not let you down so please work hard for him, give him all the support, campaign for him to get into the Government House, Yenagoa.

“I am talking to you as one of the founders of APC. I was at one time chairman of PDP. When I saw that things were going wrong, I wrote a letter to the then president, he didn’t like the letter and I resigned.”

Lokpobiri, said he was on a mission to save Bayelsa people from what he described as poor administration, poverty and the darkness that took over the state since 2011.
