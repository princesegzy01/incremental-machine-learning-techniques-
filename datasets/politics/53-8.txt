Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress on Thursday met with aggrieved Kogi State governorship aspirants.

The meeting was as a result of the disagreement that greeted the August 29 governorship primary.

Governor Yahaya Bello was declared the winner of the primary contested by 10 of the 16 persons that obtained the form.

A statement by the APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, said after the meeting, the party named a three-member appeal panel for the primaries in Kogi and Bayelsa states.

Conspicuously missing at the peace meeting was the former Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Usman Jibrin (retd.).

Addressing journalists after the meeting, Oshiomhole said the aspirants had agreed to work together to ensure victory for the party in the November 16 election.
