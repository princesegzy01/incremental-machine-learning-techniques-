Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

The chairman of the committee on the recovery of stolen movable assets belonging to the Imo State government, Jasper Ndubuaku, has said that the committee had recovered over 70 vehicles since its inauguration by the State Governor, Emeka Ihedioha.

Ndubuaku, who spoke to our correspondent in Owerri, the state capital on Tuesday, said that the committee had equally recovered two asphalt plants.

The governor’s aide said that the committee had recovered properties worth N1bn.

Ndubuaku, who served as a lawmaker in the state between 1999 and 2007, said the committee was not on a witch-hunt mission against anybody as being alleged by the immediate past governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha.

According to him not all the recovered properties belonged to the members of the Okoorcha family.

He said that the committee equally recovered some of the properties from ex aides and appointees of Okorocha.

Ndubuaku said that Okorocha “damaged” the state by governing it wrongly.

He said, “We are not witch-hunting anybody. The facts are there.

“We have recovered over 70 vehicles. We equally recovered two asphalt plants. The estimate of things we have recovered is about N1bn. More are to come. We have all the records.”
