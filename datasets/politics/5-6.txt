Appeal court affirms El-Rufaiâ€™s victory
Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

The Court of Appeal sitting in Kaduna on Thursday affirmed Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State as the winner of the March 9 governorship election in the state.

The appellate court upheld the judgment of the election tribunal which had earlier affirmed El-Rufai, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, as the winner of the election.

The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared him the winner of the March 9 governorship election in the state.

But dissatisfied, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Isa Ashiru, approached the Kaduna State Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal, where the tribunal dismissed his petition.

Again, the PDP candidate filed an appeal against the ruling of the tribunal.

However, the five-man panel of the appeal court upheld the decision of the tribunal and declared El-Rufai the duly elected governor of Kaduna State.

In the unanimous judgment delivered by Justice Olumuyiwa Aburu, the appellate court upheld the judgment of the tribunal.

The Court of Appeal aligned with the tribunal judgment which ruled that the PDP candidate could not prove his allegations of massive rigging and other electoral irregularities levelled against the governor.
