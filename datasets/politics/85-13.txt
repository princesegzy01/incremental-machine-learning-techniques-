Senate swears in Imo North senator
The Senate has sworn-in Ben Uwajumogu as Senator representing Imo North Senatorial District.

The brief ceremony was conducted by President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan at the plenary on Friday.

News Agency of Nigeria reports that Uwajumogu was finally presented with Certificate of Return by the Independent National Electoral Commission in Abuja on Thursday, after weeks of legal tussle.

In an interview with journalists after his swearing-in, Uwajumogu alleged that he was unjustly denied membership of the Senate by INEC, three weeks after securing a favourable judgment in court.
