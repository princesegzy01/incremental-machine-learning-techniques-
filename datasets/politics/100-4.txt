Success Nwogu, Abuja

The Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Walid Jibrin, on Thursday said the PDP BoT and the party’s National Working Committee had forwarded the PDP’s list for minority leadership position to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila.

Speaking with journalists in Abuja on Thursday, Jibrin said the NWC and BoT would continue to work together for the progress of the party.

He said, “As a result of the fracas in the House of Representatives during the selection of the PDP/minority, principal officers, the BOT and the NWC have decided to intervene immediately by the NWC forwarding the party’s list to the Speaker for urgent implementation.

“I want to assure all that the NWC and BOT will continue to work together in order to move the party forward. That is my statement.”

When asked why he reportedly endorsed the attempt of a member representing Aniocha/Oshimili federal constituency, Delta State, Mr Ndudi Elumelu, to emerge as the Minority Leader as against the party’s choice of Kingsley Chinda, who is a member representing Obio/Akpor federal constituency, Jibrin said he was not aware of the fracas in the House of Representatives when Elumelu and his group visited him.

The PDP had in a letter dated, June 21, addressed to the Speaker confirmed that Chinda was the selected Minority Leader; Chukwuka Onyema (Deputy Minority Leader); Yakubu Barde (Minority Whip) and Muraina Ajibola (Deputy Minority Whip).

The letter was signed by the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, and the PDP Secretary, Senator Umaru Tsauri.
