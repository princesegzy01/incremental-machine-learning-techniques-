The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, on Saturday inaugurated two mini stadia and a knowledge and innovation centre in the Surulere area of Lagos State.

Gbajabiamila, who also presented desktop computers and laptops to secondary school pupils, as well as buses to notable organisations, said the gesture was in fulfilment of his campaign promises.

He said, “When we started this journey in 2003, the magnitude of the challenges we faced — politically and in terms of social development — were so enormous that many people were rightly concerned about our ability to rise to the challenges and to overcome them.

“Standing here today, I am confident to say that indeed, we have overcome and triumphed.

“Though our challenges are still great, we shall continue to overcome together as one indivisible brotherhood of people.”

Gbajabiamila, who thanked the people for what he called, their consistent support for him, promised to deliver more impactful projects in the constituency.

The Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, commended Gbajabiamila for the projects, saying they would go a long way in touching the lives of the people in the constituency.

Sanwo-Olu said, “What we are trying to do as a state government is to move closer to the people through what I can call community government. We want to touch the lives of people of all communities in the state.”

Also, the Minister of Youths and Sports, Mr Sunday Dare, represented by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr Olusade Adesola, said the new stadia would help in the development of grass-roots sports.
