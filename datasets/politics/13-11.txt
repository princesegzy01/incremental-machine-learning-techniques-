Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has advised indigenes of the state in the 78 Regular Recruit of the Nigeria Army to see their enlistment as a call to service and to always be of good conduct while discharging their duties.

Oyetola spoke through his deputy, Olugboyega Alabi, while receiving the new recruits that just completed their training in Zaria, Kaduna State, who paid him a courtesy call.

He said the Army â€œuniform should not be seen as a means to terrorise law-abiding citizens in the country.

The governor added that the uniform remained an instrument for protection of the nation against enemy.

He congratulated the soldiers on the successful completion of six months training and warned that the opportunity given to them by the Nigerian Army to serve should not be misused.

He also urged them to be dedicated, dutiful and see prayer as a vital weapon that should not be neglected anywhere they may find themselves.
