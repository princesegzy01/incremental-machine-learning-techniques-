Nigeria’ll overcome security challenges – Senator
Sunday Aborisade, Abuja

The Deputy Senate Minority Leader, Senator Emmanuel Bwacha, who is also the President, Christian Legislators Fellowship of Nigeria, has said only prayers can solve the security challenges confronting the country.

He said, if Nigerians were strong and fervent in prayers, the mirage of security challenges confronting the country, including banditry, insurgency and kidnapping, would be nipped in the bud.

Bwacha, who said this in Abuja during the 10th anniversary of the National Prayer Breakfast organised by the fellowship, expressed optimism that Nigeria would overcome its security challenges.

He said, “With the security, leadership and economic challenges confronting the country, we shall overcome. It requires our prayers.”

According to Bwacha, the programme was organised to reawaken the citizens as they “cannot afford to be careless about our Christian lives, given the circumstances of recent times.”
