Anambra APC knocks Gbajabiamila over appointment
Tony Okafor, Awka

The Anambra State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has condemned the appointment of a chieftain of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Anambra State, Anayo Nnebe, as a special assistant to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.

The party on Friday described the appointment as a slap on members of the APC in the state.

In a press statement by the Anambra Central Zonal Publicity Secretary of the APC, Igboeli Arinze, the party said members of the APC in state and the South-East were urging the Speaker to rescind his decision or face the anger of party members in the region.

Arinze said the party condemned in its entirety the appointment of Nnebe as Special Assistant to Gbajabiamila on South-East matters.

The statement stated, “The appointment leaves a sour taste in the mouths of party faithful who have stood by the party through thick and thin and expect much better from the Speaker.

“The appointment of Nnebe, an APGA member, is indeed a slap on the face of the APC, not only in the zone where Nnebe hails from but the entire South-East zone; it is not acceptable.

“We wonder on what criteria Gbajabiamila based his appointment. In a zone known for its combustible and intellectually combative-like politics, Nnebe obviously can never be the choice.

In separate statements on Wednesday by the Conference of the APC State Publicity Secretaries and South-East APC Young Progressives Forum in Awka, the two groups described Nnebe’s appointment as an affront on the party loyalists in the area as well as an empowerment of APC’s enemies in the zone.
