Tribunal reserves judgement on Omo-Agege, Oboro suit
Ochei Matthew, Asaba

The Delta State Election Petitions Tribunal, presided over by Justice A.M. Abubakar, on Monday adjourned judgment to a later date, on the petition filed by Evelyn Oboro of the Peoples Democratic Party against the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege of the All Progressives Congress, in the February 23 National Assembly Election.

The petitioner, Oboro, had contested against Omo-Agege (1st respondent) to represent Delta Central Senatorial District in the Senate.

Oboroâ€™s counsel, Prof. Wahab Egbewole (SAN), told the tribunal that as of the time of the election, Omo-Agege was not qualified to contest the election by virtue of the fact that the APC in Delta State was factionalised and had internal crisis.

He said the election was fraught with irregularities and that Oboro should be declared the winner of the election, having the highest number of valid votes cast and that in the alternative, the tribunal should declare a rerun in some disputed areas in Ugheli North, Udu and Ethiope West.

The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd respondents, Omo-Agege, the APC and INEC, represented by Dr Alex Izinyon (SAN), Mr Adeniyi Akintola (SAN) and Mr A.G Mrakpo, respectively, in the adoption of their written addresses submitted before the tribunal, stated that the petitioners had not been able to prove their cases and discharge the burden of proof placed on them, and urged the tribunal to dismiss the petition.

Justice Abubakar, however, reserved the judgment until a future date on the matter, saying the entire parties would be communicated to.
