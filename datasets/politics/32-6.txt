Mass defection hits SDP in Osun
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

A few hours after Dr Bayo Faforiji resigned as the Osun State chairman of the Social Democratic Party, more leaders on Thursday dumped the party in the state.

The party’s Osun West Senatorial Chairman, Mr Adetoye Ogungboyega, told our correspondent that the party’s Deputy National Chairman, South, Dr Olu Agunloye, had told some party stalwarts at a meeting that Senator Iyiola Omisore would be presented as the governorship candidate of the party in 2022.

Ogungboyega said, “SDP has lost focus. We were summoned to a meeting where Dr Olu Agunloye, the Deputy National Chairman, South, of the SDP, told us that Senator Omisore would still be presented as the candidate of the party in 2022.

“We consider this as uncalled for. We are not going to sit back and allow such a miscalculation. We have left SDP for good. We will duly inform you of our next plan very soon.”

He said seven local government chairmen of the party and some members of the State Working Committee had also dumped the party.

According to him, the state Deputy Chairman, Folaranmi Hamzat, and the state Women Leader, Alhaja Iyabo Oyedele, had also left the party.

When contacted, Agunloye, in a message sent to our correspondent, described the allegations as a “complete fiction”, adding that “It is false and baseless. There is nothing like that.”
