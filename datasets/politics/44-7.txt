Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has relieved the Special Adviser on Talent Development and Gender Education, Mrs Helen Bob, of her appointment.

Bob’s dismissal was announced on Wednesday in a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Fidelis Soriwei.

Soriwei said the governor sacked her for “repeated acts of gross misconduct, indiscipline, irresponsibility and acts unbecoming of a person occupying the high position of Special Adviser in any government whatsoever.”

He added that she had been a special adviser for almost eight years.

Dickson’s spokesman said Bob was among 130 special advisers out of over 2,000 appointees engaged by the governor to render necessary services to the state and to give a sense of belonging and legitimate support to party members.

The statement added that the governor wished Bob well in her future endeavours.
