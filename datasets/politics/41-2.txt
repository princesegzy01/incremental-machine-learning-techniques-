The Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, has asked the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, to remove all obstacles for the smooth passage of the 2020 budget.

A statement on Sunday said the governor spoke in Kano during Gbajabiamila’s condolence visit to a member of the House, Sha’aban Sharada, over the demise of his father, Alhaji Ibrahim Sharada.

The governor said, “We were just discussing about the budget. The Federal Government will soon send the budget and I heard your comments on how soon that budget will be ready. I think that is a progressive stand that you have taken. I am sure that with that in your mind, you will do everything possible to see that all unnecessary obstacles are removed for a smooth passage of our national budget.”

Ganduje thanked the Speaker for having a progressive relationship with the executive arm, saying that would take Nigeria to the next level.

The Speaker, according to the statement, was received in the state by the Majority Leader of the House, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa and other members of the House from the state. They visited the Sharada family and offered prayers for the repose of Ibrahim’s soul.

The Speaker condoled with the government and people of the state on the death Ibrahim, whom he described as a father, an Islamic scholar and a political leader.
