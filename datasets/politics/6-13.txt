Gaya who spoke to newsmen after the exercise said that the three nominees were invited to the committee and were all screened.

“They were asked questions and they answered to the best of their abilities, there were no petitions for the two of the candidates Dr Alalibo Johnson and Alhaji Aminu Guram.

“There was a petition against Olalekan from Osun State based on the constitutional provision of the Act which said the President should nominate present Commissioners of INEC of people of integrity and good character and they should not be a card-carrying member of any political party.

“For Olalekan, there was a petition against him that he is a member of a political party, that he has run campaigns and that he is a registered member of a political party.

“We asked him questions he defended himself to the best he could but there is still more to ask him.

“We have given him two days to come back to us for more discussions,” Gaya said.
