Bayelsa entertainers back PDP team
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

A group of entertainers in Bayelsa State has declared support for the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Douye Diri, and his running mate, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo.

The entertainers, comprising comedians, musicians, movie artistes and dancers, said electing the PDP team was the only option to sustain the developmental strides of Governor Seriake Dickson.

The spokesman for the group, Joseph Okpeke, aka MC Okpeke, stated that Diri and Ewhrudjakpo had track records of administrative and governance experience that the state needed to continue building on the foundation laid by the governor.

According to him, the entertainers took the decision to support the duo after a strategic meeting in Yenagoa.

Okpeke said the entertainment industry in Bayelsa State had flourished due to the commitment of the Dickson-led administration to the development of the industry.
