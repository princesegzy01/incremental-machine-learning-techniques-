Youths want 2023 presidency zoned to South-East
Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia

The Coalition of South-East Youths has said the office of the President of Nigeria should be zoned to the South-East geopolitical zone by the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party after the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.

The group, in a statement by its President, Chief Goodluck Ibem, stated that the refusal of any big political party to zone the Presidency to the South-East in 2023 would simply mean swimming against the tide of democracy.

The youths pointed out that those clamouring for the North to retain the Presidency after eight years of Buhari were not patriotic Nigerians, adding that they “place their personal gain and aggrandisement above the survival, progress and success of the country.”

The statement read in part, “The zoning arrangement in Nigeria was borne out of doctrine of necessity designed with the sole objective of giving a sense of belonging, harmony, happiness, peace and unity for our dear country.

“Zoning of the Presidency has its moral weight. Zoning of the office of the president to the South-East in 2023 is very important to preserve the corporate existence of Nigeria and also calm down political tension.

“Elder statesmen and Nigerian Patriots knew that the best thing to do in order to keep the peace and unity of this country was the zoning of the highest office in the country should rotate between the South and the North.”

According to it, the South-East geopolitical zone deserves to assume power after the tenure of Buhari in 2023.
