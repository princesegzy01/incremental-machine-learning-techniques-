I will reclaim my mandate —Niger PDP gov candidate
Enyioha Opara, Minna

Umar Nasko, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Niger State, has said that he is confident the election tribunal will rule in his favour and declare him the winner of the governorship election in the state.

In his Sallah message made available to newsmen on Friday, Nasko urged Muslim faithful to pray for the country, adding that the harassment, killings and the heated dimension the 2019 election took will do no one any good.

According to him “I’m a firm believer in the rule of law and democratic tenets, and this is one of the reasons, I have after the elections approached the election tribunal to tender all issues relating to forgeries and electoral malpractices.

“With what I witnessed in the last election, I’m confident in not too distant time our mandate to lead Niger state will be restored.”

He said “The truth is, after the 2015 general elections which saw opposition winning, one would expect that we have raised above election malpractices and shenanigans, but the 2019 elections leaves much to be desired, the harassment, and killings and the heated dimension the 2019 election took will do no one any good.”
