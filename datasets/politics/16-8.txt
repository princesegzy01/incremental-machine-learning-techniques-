‘Bayelsa PDP in panic mode ahead of poll’
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Bayelsa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress on Thursday accused the ruling Peoples Democratic Party of trying to create panic in the state to prepare the ground for “a state government-sponsored violence” ahead of the November 16 governorship election.

The state APC Publicity Secretary, Mr Doifie Buokoribo, made the accusation in a reaction to the allegations of election rigging and violence earlier made by the state PDP chairman, Mr Cleopas Moses.

Buokoribo, who doubles as the Secretary, Media and Publicity Committee of the APC Bayelsa Governorship Campaign Council, made his position known in a statement.

The statement read, “It is clear to the people of Bayelsa State and, indeed, Nigeria that the Peoples Democratic Party in the state is in a terrible panic mode. Raising a false alarm is only a way of managing their anxiety.

“False accusation and panic-mongering have been their signature election eve dress rehearsal for violence and electoral manipulation. The whole country saw it in 2015/2016.

“Ahead of November 16, the PDP in the state is engaged in another full-scale practice before the launch of their terror assault on our democracy.

“The party seems even more desperate this time. Hit by a wave of defections and imminent consequence of its poor performance, the PDP in Bayelsa is nervous and it has entered a persecution complex mode.”
