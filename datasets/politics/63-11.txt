Alaibe rejects list of congress officials
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

A frontline contestant for the Peoples Democratic Party’s ticket in the Bayelsa State governorship race, Chief Timi Alaibe, has faulted the unilateral inclusion of certain names on the list of returning and electoral officers for the party’s ward congresses held across the state on Saturday.

According to him, the inclusion of such names on the list was contrary to the PDP constitution and guidelines for the conduct of a peaceful primary.

Objecting to the list in a statement he personally signed, Alaibe stated that “the names have been inserted to put certain aspirants, especially those of the Restoration Group, at advantage.”

The former Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta Affairs insisted that the plot was a deliberate calculation to create confusion and frustrate his aspiration to lead Bayelsa State, stressing that “this is a mere imagination.”

He said, “They have failed this time around because no degree of intrigues, no amount of manipulation and propaganda can push me out of this race.

“ Alaibe said he had taken appropriate steps to notify the party leadership of attempts to compromise the primary election processes and expressed confidence in the capacity of the party’s national leadership to correct the wrongs.
