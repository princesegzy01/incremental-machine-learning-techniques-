The Independent National Electoral Commission says it will carry out an assessment of the implementation of electoral activities to ensure the successful conduct of the Bayelsa State governorship election.

INEC said it would examine the preparations in each of the eight local government areas of the state.

The Chairman, Planning, Monitoring and Support Centre, INEC, Dr Mustapha Lecky, stated this during the Election Monitoring and Support Centre Implementers Workshop held at the commission’s office in Yenagoa.

The programme was supported by the European Centre for Electoral Support and funded by the European Union with the European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria.

Lecky, who was represented by Prof Bolade Ayinla, Chief Technical Adviser to the National Chairman of INEC, said, “Election cannot be complete until we deliver results. It is important that we remain focussed and continually assess the implementation stages of the electoral activities.

“The EMSC is to ensure the success of Bayelsa governorship election.”

INEC National Commissioner in charge of Bayelsa, Edo and Rivers states, Mrs May Agbamuche, said the workshop was held to fine-tune all arrangements for a hitch-free poll.

She said, “We need to constantly track all levels of preparations to ensure that everything goes according to plan.”
