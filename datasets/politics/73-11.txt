Bayelsa commends voters over council pollsâ€™ success
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Government of Bayelsa State has commended the residents for their active participation in the local government elections conducted on Saturday.

The government also congratulated the State Independent Electoral Commission for organising a fair and peaceful poll which it claimed, could be adjudged as the most credible since the creation of the state.

The Peoples Democratic Party won the chairmanship position in all the eight local government areas of the state.

A statement in Yenagoa by the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Daniel Iworiso-Markson, said the large turnout recorded in the eight council areas was a testimony of the confidence the electorate reposed in the credibility of the process under the commission.

He said the election had set high standards for the Independent National Electoral Commission, ahead of the November 16 governorship election in the state.

The commissioner said the national electoral body must not dash the hope of the people for a credible governorship poll.

He said the government was proud of the BYSIEC for the feat.

He further noted that the people of Bayalsa had proved to the world that democracy was alive in the state and that things could be done right given the right environment.
