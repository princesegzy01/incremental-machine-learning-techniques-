Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

The Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun on Wednesday, signed the Osun State Security Trust Fund and the Ogun State Road Maintence Agency (Amendment) 2019 bills which were passed by the state House of Assembly into law.

This was contained in a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin.

The statement explained that the bills were signed by Abiodun after the documents were presented to him by the Speaker of the House, Olakunle Oluomo, at the Governor’s Office.

Somorin said the governor had last week inaugurated a committee for the trust fund, headed by Mr Bolaji Balogun to source for money for the acquisition and deployment of security equipment.

He said the panel would also organise human resources and finance that would be necessary to prevent crime and preserve public peace.

The statement read, “The committee is also to promote what he called the effect encyclopedia of all security agencies in the state, hold property and money for the purpose of crime prevention.

“It will also moblise resources in cash or kind from the public, private and corporate institutions, and manage them in a transparent and accountable manner for the purpose of public security”.

The law has been amended by the Ogun State Security Trust Fund Law 2019.

Somorin said Abiodun had promised that the deplorable township and rural roads in the state would soon begin to wear new look as the agency would swing into action with the signing of the OGROMA law.
