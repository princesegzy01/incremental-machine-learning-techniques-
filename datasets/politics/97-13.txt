Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

The Senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial zone at the National Assembly, Uba Sani, said on Sunday that he did not, at any point, condemn President Muhammadu Buhari for reappointing his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari.

The senator through a Press release by his Legislative Assistant, Abubakar Abubakar, refuted a social media report claiming that he criticised the President over his reappointment of his Chief of Staff.

In the statement made available to The PUNCH in Kaduna, the senator said the report was “the handiwork of mischief makers out to cause disaffection in the All Progressives Congress’ family.”

He said investigation had revealed that the said post was fabricated by an aide to an unnamed defeated senatorial candidate in the 2019 election.

The release said, “The attention of distinguished senator Uba Sani has been drawn to posts on Facebook and WhatsApp groups.

“In the said posts, Senator Sani was alleged to have blasted our dear President over his reappointment of Abba Kyari as Chief of Staff.

“Our investigation has revealed that the posts were fabricated and ascribed to the distinguished senator by an aide of a defeated senatorial candidate in the 2019 senatorial elections.

“The aim is to bring the distinguished senator to public ridicule and odium and portray him as disloyal to the President and the ruling All Progressives Congress.

“The defeated senatorial candidate hopes that through this subterfuge he will warm himself back to the heart of Mr. President and possibly make a return from the political wilderness.

“We wish to state emphatically that Senator Uba Sani is a key loyalist of President Muhammadu Buhari.

“He holds the President in the highest esteem and would never do anything to demean our iconic leader.”
