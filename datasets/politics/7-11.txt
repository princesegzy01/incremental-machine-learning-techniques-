Violence may scare away PWDs — CCD
Adelani Adepegba, Abuja

A non-governmental organisation, the Centre for Citizens with Disabilities, has observed that people living with disabilities may not be able to vote in Kogi and Bayelsa states on account of the volatile atmosphere in both states.

Presenting an assessment report on provisions by the Independent National Electoral Commission for the PWDs in Kogi State in Abuja on Tuesday, the CCD Director, Mr David Anyaele, expressed worry about the security situation in Kogi and Bayelsa and advised physically-challenged voters not to risk their lives during the exercise.

He said, “We are worried about the security situation in Kogi and Bayelsa states. Every day, politicians are talking like warlords and we are asking INEC and security agencies to ensure adequate security for voters, particularly people living with disabilities.

“I will tell the PWDs in Kogi and Bayelsa that if they feel the situation is not safe enough, they should stay away. They should not risk their lives because they want to fulfil their civic responsibility.”

The CCD director said he had submitted his assessment report to INEC, which he said had promised to provide materials in braille format, magnifying glasses and others, to make it easy for the PWDs to vote.
