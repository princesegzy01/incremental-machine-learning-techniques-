Obaseki sacks LG political appointees
Sola Shittu Benin

Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, on Monday, sacked all local government political appointees in the 18 local government areas of the state.

Obaseki had earlier this month sacked over 300 political appointees in what is described as a surreptitious move to gain control of the state political class.

About four council chairmen, Eghe Ogbemudia (Egor); Patrick Aguinede, (Esan West); Alhaji Yakson Musa in Etsako West and Alhaji Aremiyau Momoh of Etsako East, have been suspended for alleged corrupt activities.

The affected council officials include special advisers, senior special assistants, secretary to local government and supervisory councillors.

The sacking was contained in a three-paragraph letter.

One of the affected appointees in Owan East, Mr. Godwin Imoudu, confirmed the sack, saying he had received his letter.

The PUNCH gathered that the sack of the local government political appointees was initially designed to affect only those in Edo North senatorial district before it was extended to all the 18 local government areas.
