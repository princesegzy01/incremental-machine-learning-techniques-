Abia govt attacks Otti over anti-Ikpeazu comments
Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia

The Abia State Government has faulted a two-time governorship candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance in the state, Chief Alex Otti, for accusing Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of non-performance.

Otti had during a press conference in Lagos, on Monday, said the Ikpeazu-led administration owed pensioners and other government workers, adding that Abians should reject a $200m loan the governor wanted to take.

But the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Onyebuchi Ememanka, faulted Otti’s claims, adding that he was not in touch with the state of affairs in Abia.

Ememanka said, “Otti wants to govern Abia from his Lagos base. He doesn’t live here, has no business interest here and is completely ignorant of what happens here.”

He also accused Otti of being responsible for the slow pace of development in the state since the APGA candidate had boasted of truncating the attempts by the state government to secure a loan from the African Development Bank for purposes of infrastructural upgrade and other related uses.

The CPS added, “Dr Otti was not fair on Governor Ikpeazu when he alleged that there was no visible road construction done by this government when he admitted that he was aware of 59 road projects done by Ikpeazu out of 79 road projects the governor listed during a debate in the build-up to the 2019 governorship election.”
