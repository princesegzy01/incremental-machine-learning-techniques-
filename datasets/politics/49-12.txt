Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

A group of professionals and elders of the All Progressives Congress across the South-West geopolitical zone on Tuesday in Ibadan, resolved to fine-tune a ‘16-point agenda’ to ensure the success of the second term of President Muhammadu Buhari.

The group, under the auspices of the ‘Nigeria Next-Level Forum’ were mostly loyalists of the National leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu.

Some of those who attended the meeting were the group’s national coordinator, Chief Oladosu Oladipo; the South-West coordinator, Dr Olagoke Salami; Akintayo Amere (Osun State coordinator); Ibrahim Bolomope and some serving APC Reps.

Others billed to address the gathering but had yet to arrive the venue before journalists left the Watershed Events Centre, Ibadan, were its National Chairman, Pauline Tallen, and Tinubu’s daughter, Chief Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, who is the national women leader of the group.

Tagged South-West meeting, the NLF leaders said they were after the success of the APC-led Federal Government.

Oladipo said the aim of the forum was “to develop the correct template for Nigeria’s Next Level prosperity through a rapid, systematic and sustainable social economic growth and development.”
