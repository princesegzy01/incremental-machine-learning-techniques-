Ex-CP laments poverty, insecurity in Bayelsa
Bayelsa State governorship aspirant, Mrs Diseye Nsirim-Poweigha, has lamented the security and economic challenges facing the state.

The former Commissioner of Police in Niger State, who is expected to take part in the All Progressives Congress primary poll on August 29, promised to develop the state if elected governor in the November 16 governorship election.

According to her, Bayelsa has remained underdeveloped despite being the leading producer of oil and gas.

Nsirim-Poweigha blamed bad leaders for the failure of the state to take advantage of its resources.

The ex-police chief said, “Poverty incubates criminality, which is expressed in kidnapping, cultism, armed robbery and drug abuse abounding in the state.

“The state is enmeshed in violence and crisis, resulting in killing and maiming of people as well as destruction of property. All these are a departure from the dreams of the founding fathers of the state, whose transcendental belief was to have a state where the people will live in peace.”

Nsirim-Poweigha stated that she decided to join the governorship race to help develop the state.

She said, “We have entered the race with passion and zeal of setting up a true democratic culture with accountable and fiscal regime as the leading light of governance. More than anything, we want to create a fundamental change in the logic and values of governance in Bayelsa State.”

According to her, the immediate past Minister of State for Agriculture, Heineken Lokpobiri, who is the favourite for the APC ticket, will not pose any threat to her ambition.
