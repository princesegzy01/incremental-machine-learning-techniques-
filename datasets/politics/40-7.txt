Ngige twisting achievements with lies – Obi
Tony Okafor, Awka

The vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last general elections, Mr Peter Obi, has said the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige cannot diminish him with his campaign of calumny.

He said Ngige’s achievement as the governor of Anambra State was too little to erase his( Obi’s) achievements and reputation before the people of Anambra State.

He asked Ngige to focus his energy on how to make Nigeria work, rather than dissipating energy on how to pull him down.

Obi spoke through his Media Adviser, Valentine Obienyem, in a statement on Monday.

The former governor was reacting to a statement credited to Ngige where the minister allegedly said he was ashamed of the quality of roads constructed by his successors, including Obi .

Obi wondered why Ngige loved attacking him, stating that he had hardly made any sad comments against the minister even at the heat of electioneering.

He said,“What is most condemnable in Ngige’s attacks are the lies he tells just to bring Obi down. How could he mention roads such as Abatete-Nteje-Aguleri-Otuocha and Igboukwu-Ezenifite-Umunze , Iseeke and deliberately forgot that Obi did greater portions of those roads?

“Over 90 per cent of the roads Ngige claimed to build were done in his local government area.
