Campaign fund: Buhari receives financial report from APC NWC
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday received the financial report of campaign funding from the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress.

The presentation took place at their meeting held at the presidential villa in Aso Rock in Abuja.

A source told our correspondent that the presentation was the highlight of the meeting between the party leaders and the president.

The source said, “The financial report was presented to the president in demonstration of the party’s model for accountability and transparency.

“The report gave details of how money was raised through sales of forms and how the campaigns were funded from the money realised. The party has set a record by being the first political party to do so.”

Recall that the Independent National Electoral Commission recently accused political parties of not submitting their financial reports for auditing.

A member of the NWC who also attended the meeting said, “The party has set a good example for other political parties, let the opposition Peoples Democratic Party submit their own if sources of their campaign funding were not questionable or fraudulent.

“By this, we have demonstrated to the opposition that we are not on the same pedestal and that this government will not condone financial irregularities, let them accept the challenge.”
