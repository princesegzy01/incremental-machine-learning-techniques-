Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has expressed shock over the death of the Oniru of Iruland, Victoria Island, Lagos, Oba Idowu Abiodun Oniru.

Oniru died on Monday, aged 82, after a brief illness.

Gbajabiamila said Oba Oniru would be remembered for his fatherly role and commitment to the development of Iruland.

The Speaker, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, described the passing of the monarch as painful at a time when his advice and guidance were needed by leaders of the state and country.

Gbajabiamila, who noted that Oniru was the architect of the modern and sprawling Oniru Estate on Victoria Island, added that the late traditional ruler did a lot to develop his land, the results of which could be attested to by all.

He said, “I wish to extend my heartfelt condolences to the family of our late royal father, His Royal Majesty Oba Idowu Abiodun Oniru. His death came to me as a shock, but I take solace in the exemplary life that he lived and the legacies that he left behind.

“Oba Idowu Abiodun Oniru was a father to all. He was a peace-loving man, who did his best to make his people happy. I wish to commiserate with the government and the people of Lagos State, particularly the subjects of His Royal Majesty, over this great and irreparable loss.”

The Speaker prayed for the repose of the soul of the late royal father.
