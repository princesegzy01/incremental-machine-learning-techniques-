I’ll reclaim my mandate –Niger PDP candidate
Enyioha Opara, Minna

The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the March 9 Niger State governorship poll, Umar Nasko, has said he is confident the Election Petitions Tribunal will declare him the winner of the election.

Nasko, who is challenging the declaration of Governor Abubakar Bello of the All Progressives Congress as the winner of the election by the Independent National Electoral Commission, said on Friday he believed in the judiciary.

He said, “I am a firm believer in the rule of law and democratic tenets, and this is one of the reasons I approached the tribunal to tender all issues relating to electoral malpractices.

“With what I witnessed in the last election, I am confident in not too distant time our mandate to lead Niger State will be restored.”
