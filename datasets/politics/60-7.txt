The Oodua People’s Congress has rejected the plan by the Aare Ona Kakanfo, Gani Adams, to honour the founder of the group, the late Dr Fredrick Fasehun.

The new leader of the OPC faction, Chief Prince Osibote, rejected the award being planned for Fasehun at a press briefing in the Okota area of Lagos on Wednesday.

Adams, who is a leader of a faction of the OPC, had announced the plan to honour Fasehun Thursday, but Osibote said his faction would not accept the award.

Osibote, who took over the leadership of the OPC after the demise of the founder, said Adams would not be allowed to honour Fasehun, whom he said Adams did not honour while alive.

He said, “Otunba Gani Adams cannot honour Fasehun. You can’t honour a father you didn’t respect while he was alive. We must be conscious of the consequences of desecrating the dead.

“Nobody can delude the Yoruba people with a hypocritical honorary award after such individual and his coterie of jesters had despised, abused and attempted to kill the man and his lofty dream of restoring the dignity of a race famous for valour and setting the pace and records in all human endeavours.

“Nigerians should discountenance such a deceitful honorary gesture. It is another Greek gift.”
