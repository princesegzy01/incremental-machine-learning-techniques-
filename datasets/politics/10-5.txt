PDP backs INEC over Bayelsa, Kogi gov elections
Success Nwogu

The Peoples Democratic Party has backed the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct transparent governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states on November 16.

The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja, said they would however protest against any manipulations.

He said, “We have confidence in INEC that it will provide an environment that will lead to credible elections. However, where we have issues, where there are cases of possible manipulations, we will quickly bring them out in order to help the commission to achieve its desires.

“But where we also discover that there is a deliberate plot by the commission to subvert the process for a credible election, we will also come out and speak out against it.”

The PDP had accused some INEC officials and some leaders of the All Progressives Congress of plotting to prevent its candidate for the Kogi poll, Musa Wada, from the contest.

Ologbondiyan had said the plot to delist Wada was in an alleged bid to help Governor Yahaya Bello, who is the APC’s candidate, win the contest.

He also alleged that some people had recruited 205 APC loyalists, who, he alleged were being trained at Muslim Community School, Lokoja, to impersonate NYSC members as Polling and Electoral Officers in designated areas to allegedly enable the APC and INEC to manipulate the process in such areas.
