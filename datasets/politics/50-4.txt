Senator awards scholarships
Sampson Itode, Port Harcourt

The lawmaker representing Rivers East Senatorial District, George Sekibo, on Tuesday, sponsored 10 undergraduates from Rivers State, to study at the Les Cours Sonou University, Cotonou, Republic of Benin.

Sekibo, while presenting letters of admission to the students in Port Harcourt, urged them to be good ambassadors of the state and Nigeria.

He added that following the negative reports about some Nigerians living abroad, the students should endeavour to be of best behaviour and shun distractions.

The Senator said, “You should be good ambassadors of Nigeria out there. You must also be of good behaviour and make your parents proud.

“I also encourage you (the students) to work very hard in your academics and always conduct yourselves properly to avoid having problems with the school and the government authorities there.

“The university would be partnering me to sponsor this scholarship, which covers the tuition, accommodation and welfare fees.

“The parents should also try to support their children in any way they can because the training of children is the joint responsibility of the sponsor, parents, school and the environment.”
