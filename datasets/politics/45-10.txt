New Reps committees to begin work in October â€“ Gbajabiamila
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The House of Representatives resumed plenary on Tuesday after an annual recess that lasted almost two months.

In his opening speech, the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, asked all ad hoc committees to hand over to the standing committees whose chairmen and vice-chairmen he named at the last sitting on July 25, 2019, by September 30.

The standing committees, whose members have not been named, are billed for inauguration.

Gbajabiamila, who said work would continue on pending bills, motions and probes, said emphasis would be placed on critical legislations such as the Petroleum Industry Bill, among others.
