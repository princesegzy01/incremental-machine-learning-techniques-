Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Col. Hameed Ali (retd.), on Wednesday failed to appear before the House of Representatives over the extrajudicial killings by men of the service in Ogun State border towns.

A member of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Sikirat Ajibola, representing Idiroko/Ipokia State Constituency, had petitioned the federal parliament over the alleged illegal activities by men of the NCS.

The House had referred the petition to the Committee on Public Petitions, which held its investigative hearing on Wednesday where the Customs boss was expected to appear.

The acting Chairman of the committee, Mr Lawal Kenken, expressed his displeasure over the non-appearance of the NCS CG.

Kenken, who is Deputy Chairman of the committee, said, “The petitioner is here but as you can see, the Customs are not here. It is a most pathetic situation.

“From the stamp of the Comptroller-General’s office, they were served this hearing notice and notice of petition was received by the Nigeria Customs on the November 6, 2019. Today is November 13, which means they received it seven days ago, and they are not here.
