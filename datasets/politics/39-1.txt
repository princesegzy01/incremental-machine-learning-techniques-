Ortom mortgaging Benue future with loans, says APC
John Charles Makurdi

The opposition All Progressive Congress in Benue State on Wednesday called on the Debt Management Office and other relevant agencies to check the arbitrary loans being obtained by the state Governor, Samuel Ortom.

Chairman of the Benue APC Likeminds, Kula Terso, who made the call in Makurdi, said the call was necessary following the new approval given by the state Assembly to Ortom to take N12b loan

According to Terso, the present administration had consistently taken loans to the tune of N69b with nothing on ground to show for the loan.

Terso expressed serious concern about the debt profile of the state and pointed out that already, the state was indebted to the tune of N96.4b local debt (Using debt profile released by Debit Management Office).

He explained that despite the N69b loan procured by Ortom administration in the past four years, ‘there is nothing on ground to show for this’.

Reacting, the state publicity secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, Bemgba Ioryyom, asked the leader of the APC group to direct his complaint to the state Assembly.

He said “The state Assembly is made of members representing the people of the state who know what was good for the state.”
