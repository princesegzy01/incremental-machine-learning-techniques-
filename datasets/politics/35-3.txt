Ted Odogwu, Kano

The Kano State Government says it will commence the distribution of 8.5 million long-lasting mosquito nets on October 5 to curb malaria which constitutes 30 per cent mortality for children under the age of five.

The state Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Usman Muhammad, said malaria was still one the major public health challenges in the country, emphasising that findings had revealed that almost half of the worldâ€™s population were at the risk of malaria.

He explained that the distribution of the mosquito nets was in collaboration, with the National Malaria Elimination Programme and Catholic Relief Services through funding from Global Funds to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM).
