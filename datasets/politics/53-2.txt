‘PDP will lose Bayelsa gov poll’
Friday Olokor, Abuja

A former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, Timi Frank, on Friday predicted that the Peoples Democratic Party would lose the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State for “choosing to field a weak candidate”.

Douye Diri has been chosen by the PDP as its candidate for the election.

Frank told our correspondent in Abuja that the candidate of the APC for the election, David Lyon, would win.

He said, “The APC will win the governorship election in Bayelsa State seeing the weak candidate who Governor Seriake Dickson and the PDP have chosen.

“It is not my wish for the APC to win the election as I am not a member of the party. I’m not also a supporter of the party. But from the look of things, the choice made by Dickson and the PDP is not inspiring.

“I want to remind those surprised that this was the same position I took against my former party, the APC, in 2015 when former governor and now the Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, was nominated. He lost the election.

“History is about to repeat itself, albeit in the PDP because it is making the same mistake that the APC made in 2015. Therefore, the handpicked PDP’s candidate will lose the election.”
