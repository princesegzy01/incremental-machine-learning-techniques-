Alleged intimidation: Zamfara APC sets up security committee
Maiharaji Altine, Gusau

The All Progressives Congress in Zamfara State has set up a security committee to protect its members against intimidation and harassment by the state government.

Briefing journalists shortly after their inauguration, the committee’s chairman, CP Abdullahi Tsafe (retd.) said, based on the reports of intimidation, harassment and destruction of APC’s properties by members of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party in the state, it became imperative for the party to stand up and defend its members.

“We will not fold our arms to see our people being subjected to all forms of maltreatment simply because we lost power in the state.”

Stating that the APC still had a large following than the ruling PDP in the state, he added, “If we are to behave the same way with the PDP, the state would be on fire.”

Tsafe maintained that they had since visited all the security formations in the state with a view to intimating them of the negative attitude of PDP members for them to take action to remedy the situation before it got out of control.
