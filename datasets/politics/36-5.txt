Get your idle aides working, APC tells Umahi
Edward Nnachi

The All Progressives Congress, Ebonyi State chapter, on Saturday charged Governor David Umahi to ask his aides to work rather than insult President Muhammadu Buhari.

The APC said abuses on Buhari and the party would cease, if the governor’s aides were committed to their duties.

Recently, Umahi threatened to sack any of his aides found insulting the President, his office or any of the governors in the country.

A statement on Saturday signed by the APC’s in the state, read in part, “From our findings, these over 800 aides of the governor ranging from senior special assistants to the lowest of the cadres, have no clear-cut responsibilities with the government, hence they seize the opportunity of their closeness to government to say all manner of things against the President.

But Umahi in a statement by his Special Assistant on New Media, Francis Nwaze, refuted the claim that his aides were idle as suggested by the APC.

The governor said his aids comprised the finest of brains, across the country, adding that they were directly monitored by those in the cabinet.
