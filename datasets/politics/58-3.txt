Number of Bayelsa PDP gov hopefuls worrisome —Aspirant
A Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirant in Bayelsa State, Mr. Reuben Okoya, says the state is at a crossroads with the number of aspirants for the November 16 election in the state.

Okoya, one of the 21 aspirants jostling for the ticket of the PDP in the September 3 primary of the party, said the high number of aspirants was worrisome.

“Bayelsa is at a crossroads and we cannot afford to get it wrong.

“The choices we make in the forthcoming elections will make or mar our chances of making progress.

“I am, however, impressed with the interest of people with credible resume.

“The reason I offer myself to aspire is that among the aspirants, I am the only one of the credible ones with verifiable records of performance.”

He also urged party delegates to the primary to vote wisely and select credible aspirant during the party’s primary on September 3.
