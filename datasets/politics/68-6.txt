Pay tax, end poverty in Oyo —Makinde
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, has pleaded for the support of different stakeholders operating in the state on adequate deductions, prompt remittance of taxes and other levies to fulfil his promises on provision of social amenities, enduring infrastructure, regular payment of government obligations and other amenities.

Makinde stated this during a one-day sensitisation workshop on computations, deductions and remittances for Federal and State Ministries, Departments and Agencies as well as tertiary institutions in the state held at the House of Chiefs, Secretariats, Ibadan.

The governor, who was represented by the Executive Chairman, Oyo State Internal Revenue Service, Mr John Adeleke, reiterated that the intention of the present administration was not going to overburden any business enterprise but would ensure government gets its “fair share of eligible tax revenue.”

Makinde said, “Presently, the fluctuations and other complex gyrations of the international oil market and the global economy means unstable and often lower revenue from federal allocation.

“The need to look inward to generate enough internal revenue to cater for the much societal demand has never been this much. We count on companies and other businesses to ensure they regularly deduct and remit their employees’ PAYE tax to our treasury.

“This will ensure mutual reciprocation of right and duties on the part of all parties. I regard such complying institutions, business and contractors as friends of my government and corporate citizens of this state of enduring opportunities.”
