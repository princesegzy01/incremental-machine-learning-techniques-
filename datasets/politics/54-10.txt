The National Assembly Election Tribunal sitting in Awka, Anambra State on Thursday affirmed Senator Stella Oduah of the Peoples Democratic Party as the winner of the election for Anambra North Senatorial District held on February 23.

The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared Oduah the winner of the poll, but Dr. Chinedu Emeka of the All Progressives Grand Alliance had dragged Oduah before the tribunal challenging her victory.

He alleged that Oduah was not qualified to contest the election because she did not possess the required academic qualifications.

Emeka, who was a former deputy governor of the state also contended that by the time of the election, Oduah was a member of APGA.

He maintained that Oduah’s declaration as the winner of the poll was not in harmony with the provisions of the Electoral Act.

In the judgement that lasted for about four hours, the Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Esther Haruna affirmed that the former minister was validly elected in the poll.

She said the petitioner failed to proved his allegations beyond reasonable doubt.

Similarly, the tribunal upheld the election of the PDP member representing Anaocha/Dunokofia/Njikoka Federal Constituency, Val Ayika, against the APGA candidate in the poll, Dozie Nwankwo.
