Nigerian youths, especially members of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, have been advised to shun violence during polls.

The Lagos State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Segun Dawodu, who spoke on Thursday in Alausa, Ikeja, while inaugurating the Transition Committee of the NYCN, Lagos State branch, said the seven-member committee which would conduct an election for a new leadership of the body must discharge its duties without bias.

Dawodu stated, “Let elections not be a do-or-die affair. So, ensure that you accommodate one another even in times of differences. Let the transition process be a veritable platform to promote unity and mutual co-existence.”

The commissioner charged the body to organise character-moulding programmes and activities for the benefit of the youths in the state in order to achieve greater heights in youth development.

He expressed the urgent need for a self-appraisal of the state of the council and to develop strategies that would improve their relevance within the context of modern realities.
