She said, “My husband’s driver, who was present said the officers who were in mufti showed him an arrest warrant and then forcefully took him away in their SUV. The driver explained that he drove after them but when they got to Zuba and observed that he was following them, they turned back and drove towards Gwarimpa.

“He then decided to return to the house to inform me. I have visited Zuba police station where the policemen said they came from, but I was told the men were not from there. I know the case is in connection with his withdrawal from the AA election petition in court.”

Genevieve further explained that unknown numbers had been calling her and her husband on the phone for some time now.
