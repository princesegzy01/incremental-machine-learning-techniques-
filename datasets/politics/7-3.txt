Sunday Aborisade, Abuja

There was a mild drama at the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission on Tuesday when the Osun State commissioner nominee for INEC, Raheem Muideen, admitted that he was once a member of the All Progressives Congress.

The Senate committee had asked Muideen to return in two days for more interrogation in order to determine whether he was qualified for the job or not.

He had appeared before the Senate Committee on INEC for his confirmation screening after his nomination by President Muhammadu Buhari.

The 46-year-old academic told the committee that he left the APC in 2015 but campaigned for the party in 2017.

There had been a petition against his nomination by one Oyebade Adebisi, who alleged that he had openly supported a political party which negated part of constitutional criteria for INEC commissioner.

Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, sought to know if the nominee was a former member of the APC and when he last appeared at her function.

The nominee claimed that he left politics in 2015 to return to school to study psychology but when accosted with pictures of his campaign in 2017 in support of a particular governorship aspirant, he struggled to explain his role.

“I am a member of the APC. I am a member of the APC and I contested the local government chairmanship in 2013. In 2015, I left politics.

“On the question on if I was a Director General of a contestant, Yes I was DG of a contestant in 2017,” Adebisi stated
