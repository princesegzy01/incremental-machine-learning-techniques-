Bayelsa election: INEC won’t transmit gov poll results electronically –REC
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Independent National Electoral Commission, on Wednesday, said it was not contemplating the electronic transmission of results in the Bayelsa State governorship election.

INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner in charge of the state, Mr Monday Udoh, stated this while responding to a question during a press conference in Yenagoa, the state capital.

Udoh said, “There is no server in Bayelsa State. Do I have a server here (in INEC office)? So, I don’t have a server to transmit results to.”

The REC said voting on election day would be done manually and results of the exercise could not therefore be transmitted electronically.

Udoh, who was flanked by his Adamawa and Delta state counterparts, Kazeem Kaigama and Cyril Omorogbe, also stated that INEC would not take issue with those making false allegations against his person and the commission’s office in the state ahead of the election.

He was reacting to allegations by the state Peoples Democratic Party’s campaign organisation that he was conniving with the opposition All Progressives Congress to rig the poll.

The REC insisted that the commission remained focused on achieving its mandate of “conducting free, fair and credible elections.” He said, “We shall not be distracted by agents of fake news and falsehood being peddled about my humble self and INEC in Bayelsa State.

“Election is a contest of win or lose. We are advising anyone that wins to be magnanimous in victory and the loser to be gallant in defeat.”
