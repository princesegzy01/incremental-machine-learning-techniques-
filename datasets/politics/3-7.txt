Group hails Bello for renaming Kogi varsity after Audu
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The decision by Governor Yahaya Bello to rename Kogi State University, Ayingba, after Prince Abubakar Audu has been described as a well-deserved honour.

The Coordinator, CEDO Media Network, Ali Atabor, made the assertion, describing the decision as long overdue and politically expedient.

He stated that nothing could have been more honourable to the late governor-elect than immortalising him with the university he laboured to establish.

He said, “Another political milestone has been achieved by the governor, which will serve as the final straw that has broken the leftover of the little opposition still left in the state.”

He described the November 16 governorship election as having been “systematically won by the APC-led administration by reasons of strategic and good political thinking,” adding that the Bello/Onoja ticket was ”the best option for sustained development of the state.”

Atabor added, “The people of the state should expect more positive contributions from governor Bello in his second term. Having had a fulfilled first term, it would be suicidal experimenting with a neophyte in driving a challenged state that the present administration has placed already on the path of growth and development.”
