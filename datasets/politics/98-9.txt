BOLA BAMIGBOLA

Immediate past governor of Osun State, Mr Rauf Aregbesola, on Saturday said his successor, Adegboyega Oyetola, would consolidate on his achievements while in office and correct mistakes of his administration.

Aregbesola spoke at Nelson Mandela Freedom Park, Osogbo at a rally organised by the All Progressives Congress to celebrate the Supreme Court judgment, which affirmed Oyetola’s election.

He called on members of the APC in the state to join efforts and build a formidable party that would control government and work for the development of the state.

Aregbesola said, “I have successfully handed over to a governor of my wish and I am sure that after his tenure, he will also hand over to another governor of his choice too. Then, I will relax as a leader and enjoy myself without any stress.”

In his remarks, Oyetola promised to work for the development of the state, saying issues relating to women and youth would be given attention.

Speaker of Osun State House of Assembly, Mr Timothy Owoeye, while addressing the gathering, called on supporters to reach out to those that have left the party and bring them back as part of efforts to further strengthen the APC in the state.
