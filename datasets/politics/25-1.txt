CDD warns against fake news
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

Ahead of the November governorship election in Kogi and Bayelsa states, the Centre for Democracy and Development has warned stakeholders against spreading disinformation, saying it threatens electoral integrity and endagers democracy.

This comes after a statement by the Secretary to the All Progressives Congress’ Media Campaign Committee, Dr Tom Ohikere, accusing the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate, Musa Wada, of saying only Eastern senatorial district voters could ensure his victory.

The CDD, in a statement published on its website, described Ohikere as being guilty of spreading “false information” about Wada.

It added, “Dr Ohikere further claimed that Kogi East constitutes only about 40 per cent of the state population, while Kogi West and Kogi Central constitute about 60 per cent.”

CDD stated that Wada’s response to questions about Kogi East was at variance with what Ohikere told the people of Kogi.

It said, “In response, Wada said, ‘Democracy is about number. It is not right for the people of Kogi East to lay claim to the seat, since it is about numbers; Kogi East is about 49 per cent of the voting population.

“The claim by Dr Ohikere, a known supporter of the APC, that the PDP candidate, Musa Wada, said Kogi East Senatorial District could singlehandedly decide who governs Kogi State is false.

“The claim by Dr Ohikere has the capacity to misinform the people of Kogi State and ignite ethnic rivalry before, during and after the election scheduled for November 16, 2019.”
