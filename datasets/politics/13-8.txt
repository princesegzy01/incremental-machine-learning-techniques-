FG urges National Assembly to okay diaspora, e-voting
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The Federal Government has urged the National Assembly to pass a bill that will allow Nigerians in the diaspora to participate in local elections from any country they are in.

The Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, made the plea in Abuja on Tuesday when she appeared before the House of Representatives’ Committee on Diaspora Affairs to defend the commission’s 2020 budget proposal.

The NIDCOM boss said, “Diaspora voting is in your hands and I think it will be a legacy that you can leave. It does not have to be in 2023 but put a timeframe to when they can vote. It is something we owe Nigerians in the diaspora.

“We are also hoping that you are going to amend the law to make electronic voting possible, at that point in time, diaspora voting, you can make it a reality.”
