Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

Loyalists of a former governor of Ogun State, Chief Olusegun Osoba, on Friday reportedly ejected supporters of the immediate-past governor of the state, Ibikunle Amosun, from the All Progressives Congress secretariat at Iyana Mortuary, Abeokuta.

The Osoba loyalists, led by the caretaker Chairman of the party, Chief Yemi Sanusi, were said to have arrived with a detachment of mobile policemen and chased away all the members of staff and party members loyal to Amosun found on the premises.

But Amosun’s faction, led by the factional party Chairman, Chief Derin Adebiyi, kicked against what it described as the illegal occupation of the facility by supporters of Osoba and Abiodun.

But Osoba’s faction said it had taken possession of the party secretariat, in a statement issued on Friday by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Kunle Somorin.
