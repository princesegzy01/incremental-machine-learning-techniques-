Bayelsa/Kogi: INEC says no extension
Friday Olokor, Abuja

The Independent National Electoral Commission on Thursday warned political parties that it would not entertain any late submission of the names of their candidates for the November 16 governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.

The commission reminded all the parties that September 5, 2019 was the last day for the conduct of their primaries while September 9 “is the last day for the submission of the list of nominated candidates.”

INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said this in a statement in Abuja.

He said, “The commission will receive all nominations at its Media Centre, INEC Headquarters, Maitama, Abuja and all nominations must be received latest 6pm on Monday, September 9, 2019.

“We enjoin all the political parties participating in the election to strictly comply with the timelines earlier released by the commission and we will not entertain any late submission under any circumstances.”
