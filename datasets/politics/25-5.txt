The Governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, on Tuesday, assured security chiefs that the security agencies would continue to enjoy the support of his administration in dealing with issues of security in the state.

Ihedioha, who spoke while receiving the General Officer Commanding 82 Division, Enugu, Brig.-Gen. Lasisi Adeboye, and his entourage at the Government House, Owerri, said the security and the welfare of his people remained the biggest priority of his administration.

The governor stated that the successes and achievements recorded in security in the state could be attributed to the unflinching support of citizens of the state in addition to the collaboration and synergy between the state government and the security agencies.

The governor said, “It was challenging tackling insecurity in the state after the elections, but we have now found our rhythm in collaboration with the security agencies to deal with crime in the state.

“The army has been working with us in tackling security challenges in the state.

“We have only one nation. Nigeria is one united country and we will continue to encourage our people to promote national unity.”

The GOC commended Ihedioha for his unwavering commitment to ensuring the security of the people of the state.

He said the Nigerian Army appreciated the governor’s support to its operations in the state and in the nation at large.
