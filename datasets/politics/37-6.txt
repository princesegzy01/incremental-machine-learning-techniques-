Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The Oyo State Government has vowed to ensure that the 2020 budget of the state is passed into law and assented to by Governor Seyi Makinde before the end of this year.

The Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Mr Adeniyi Farinto, stated this at a one day pre-budget workshop held at the state secretariat, Ibadan, on Thursday.

The Secretary to the State Government, Mrs Olubamiwo Adeosun, Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Muyiwa Ojekunle, Economic Adviser, Mr Musibau Babatunde, and the Head of Service, Alhaja Ololade Agboola, among others, spoke on the policy direction and revenue generation at the meeting, codenamed ‘Budget Realism’.

The officials appealed for the full cooperation of career officers, politicians and the people of the state in making the dream of the government a reality.

Farinto said the state had mapped out a strategy to achieve the January to December budget circle to make budget performance and evaluation easier.

He said, “When you do budget that runs into another year, it is very difficult to track, monitor and evaluate the performance of the budget.

“Once you have a January to December budget, it is so easy for you to monitor and evaluate the assessment of ministries, departments and agencies.”

The commissioner explained that a circular had been sent to MDAs directing them to submit their documents to beat the December 31 deadline.

Adeosun, in her keynote address, tasked all revenue generation agencies to block all leakages and proactively sensitise the public on the need for expanded revenue base.
