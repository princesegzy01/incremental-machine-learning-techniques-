Tribunal verdict: Let’s work together, Okowa tells Ogboru
Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has urged his rival in the March 9 governorship election, Great Ogboru of the All Progressives Congress, to join hands with his administration in building a stronger state.

The governor made the call on Friday at an interdenominational thanksgiving service shortly after the reaffirmation of his electoral victory by the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal, which sat in Asaba.

“I appeal to my brother, Ogboru, that the time has come to stop fighting; it is time to partner together to do the best that we can for our people.

“I appeal that enough is enough; it is time to build Delta State together for the good of our people.

“I ask for the hands of the opposition because Delta State is for all of us. We cannot do it alone and I want to thank our supporters and all Deltans for praying for us.

“We require the assistance of all in prayer and in human partnership.

“We must continue to pray for our state and our country because we believe that our prayer will save our country.

“As Deltans, we must hold firmly to the Lord, because Delta State will continue to remain peaceful and united as we will prosper together,” Okowa said.

The governor thanked his legal team and former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, who attended the service in company with his wife.

He assured Deltans that the next four years would be more fruitful than his first tenure.
