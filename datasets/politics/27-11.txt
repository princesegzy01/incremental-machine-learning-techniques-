CCB may probe Bayelsa PDP’s gov candidate
Ade Adesomoju, Abuja

The Code of Conduct Bureau may probe the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship candidate in the forthcoming election in Bayelsa State, Douye Diri.

This followed a petition sent to the bureau by a group, Bayelsa Coalition for Good Governance and Accountability, accusing Diri, of failing to declare his assets as a serving senator.

The group’s petition is dated September 17, 2019.

The CCB has acknowledged the receipt of the petition.

The bureau, through an October 2, 2019 letter signed by one of its directors, S. P. Gwimi, invited the petitioner for a pre-investigation interview.
