Gov polls: Oshiomhole inaugurates screening committees for Kogi, Bayelsa
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The National Chairman of the All Progressives Committee, Adams Oshiomhole, said the party had become wiser from courts judgements which disqualified its candidates for ineligibility in the past.

He said the party would guide against fielding candidates with questionable dates of birth, educational qualifications and various errors which the opposition party could latch on to snatch victory after losing at the polls.

Specifically, he cited the case of Taraba State where the Supreme Court disqualified its governorship candidate after participating in all stages of the election.

Oshiomhole spoke during the inauguration of the Governorship Screening Committees for APC aspirants for the August 29 Kogi and Bayelsa States primary elections.

Senator Hope Uzodinma is heading the Kogi State screening committee while Senator Abdullahi Gumel is heading that of Bayelsa State’s.

Oshiomhole said, “Many put it that screening is a formality but because of our own peculiarity, people are sometimes economical with the truth. We need to do proper screening and ensure that those who pass the screening are likely to be able to stand not only winning election but of not being challenged after.

“We have a couple of cases where people claimed what they didn’t have or they swore to that affidavit such that they have two, three ages depending on what purpose they are swearing affidavit for.

“We have a recent case in Taraba where our governorship candidate who went through the entire election process, his candidature was nullified by the Supreme Court on account of falsification of age. So, if we thought before that screening is a formality, we have seen that we are not meticulous.”

Oshiomhole urged the committees to observe contradiction in aspirants claims and examine issues raised against them without sentiment or partiality.
