Truckloads of policemen in Lokoja for Kogi polls
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

TEN trucks loaded with policemen have arrived Lokoja, the Kogi State capital, ahead of Saturday’s governorship and Kogi West senatorial rerun elections.

The police started arriving the state on Monday afternoon and, at the last count, 10 trucks were parked in front of the Kogi State command headquarters.

The PUNCH reports that there were sporadic gunshots all night into the early hours of Tuesday in what observers believed was a show of force to send warning signals to troublemakers.

The Police Public Relations Officer, William Aya, said there was nothing to worry about as officers were on parade, awaiting the arrival of the Inspector-General, Mohammed Adamu, who was expected to come and assess the level of preparedness as well as attend the Independent National Electoral Commission’s stakeholders’ meeting later in the day.
