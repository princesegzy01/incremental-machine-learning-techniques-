The Bauchi State Election Petition Tribunal has upheld the election of Senator Bala Mohammed as governor.

The tribunal declared that the governor of Bauchi State was duly elected and therefore struck out the case filed by former Governor, Mohammed Abubakar.

The Chairman of the Tribunal, Justice Salihu Shuaibu, in his over six-hour judgement on Monday struck out the suit for lack of merit.
