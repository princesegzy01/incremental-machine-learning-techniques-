Balarabe Musa cautions PRP members on Jega
Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

A former Kaduna State governor, who is a leader of the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, on Monday said a former National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Attahiru Jega, deregistered the party while in office.

Musa, now the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Peoples Redemption Party, therefore admonished the party to handle the former INEC’s boss entrant into the party with care and caution.

The former governor stated this when he received members of the Kaduna State council of the Nigerian Union of Journalists who paid him a Sallah homage at his residence in the state capital.

He said Jega should not forget in a hurry that the PRP he was romancing; was once deregistered by him, but that the court reversed his action.

Musa had since relinquished the national chairmanship position of the party on health grounds and settled for the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the party.

The ex-governor said he learnt of Jega’s membership of the party on the pages of newspapers.

He said, “Notwithstanding, the party membership and reorganisation, is open to all to attract a national outlook.”
