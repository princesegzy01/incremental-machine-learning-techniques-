A Court of Appeal sitting in Ilorin, on Tuesday sacked one of the 24 All Progressives Congress lawmakers in the Kwara State House of Assembly and declared the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate for Ilorin South State Constituency, Abdulraheem Agboola, as duly elected.

The judgement, delivered by Justice Hamman Barkar Hkawu, sacked the APC lawmaker, Abdulazeez Oluwanilo, and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to issue the PDP candidate a Certificate of Return.

The court based its decision on the disputed APC’s primaries which produced Suleiman Abdulsalam popularly known as Sule Cement, who was later replaced with 28-year-old Abdulazeez Oluwanilo.

The Appeal court held that APC had no valid candidate for the 2019 House of Assembly elections and thereby declared the candidate with the second highest votes, which is the PDP candidate, Abdulraheem Agboola as the winner of the election held on March 10th, 2019.

The PDP candidate had challenged the eligibility of APC candidate and his party nomination process at the tribunal.

It would be recalled the election tribunal had earlier ordered for fresh election in Ilorin South constituency.

In a statement issued in Ilorin, the Kwara PDP chairman, Kola Shittu described the court’s ruling as a victory for democracy and the rule of law.

Shittu commended Agboola for his resilience and determination to pursue justice to a logical end, and also hailed the Appeal Court justices for setting aside interests of manipulative forces and ensuring that justice was duly served.
