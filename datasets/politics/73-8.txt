One year after, APC to convoke NEC meeting
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The All Progressives Congress will soon convoke a National Executive Committee meeting, it was learnt on Monday.

A member of the National Working Committee told The PUNCH that plans were underway to summon the meeting, which last held in August, 2018.

“We are giving it a serious consideration. The NWC is planning towards it and will soon announce the time.”

Recall that the Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman, recently blamed the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, for not convening meetings of the superior organs of the party.

The APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, confirmed to our correspondent that the NEC meeting would soon hold.

Issa-Onilu, also refused to respond to inquiries on the letter written by Lukman.

Lukman had in the August 6 letter titled, “APC: Appeal for Reconciliation,” and addressed to Oshiomhole, queried why superior organs of the party had not been meeting.
