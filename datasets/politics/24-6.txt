Osun ex-speaker denies Tinubu 2023 campaign banner
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Najeem Salaam Governorship Campaign Organisation on Monday denied knowledge of a campaign outfit purported to be working for 2023 presidential ambition of Senator Bola Tinubu,

Although the campaign organisation displayed Tinubu’s banner on the wall of the ex-Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly’s campaign office, the Director General of Salaam Governorship Campaign Organisation, Bayo Oyekanmi, said he was unaware of the banner.

A large banner with the inscription, ‘Tinubu 2023 is Non Negotiable (TNN 2023), Osun State Secretariat,’ has been placed in front of the office on Gbongan-Osogbo Road.

However, Oyekanmi said, “We are unaware of the campaign for 2023.”

But checks revealed that one Olayanju Kolapo from Ejigbo is the president of the organisation that owned the banner.

It was further learnt that the organisation had members across the state that were already working towards the realisation of 2023 presidential project for the former Lagos state governor.

When contacted, the Osun President of Tinubu 2023 is Non Negotiable, Olayanju Kolapo, said the organisation was not a political party, but was instead a political movement.
