Edo APC faction sacks party secretary
Sola Shittu, Benin

The Edo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress has removed the state Secretary of the party, Mr. Lawrence Okah.

The party also passed a vote of confidence on the leadership of the state chairman, Mr. Anselm Ojezua.

This is coming as party chairmen across the 18 local government areas of the state passed a vote of no confidence on the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.

Meanwhile, two members of the party’s executive who were abducted on Monday and forced to sign a document against Ojezua have said the document was not binding, alleging that they signed it at gunpoint.

They also said the signatures were not genuine, as they had to scribble things on the document just to escape being hurt.

Briefing newsmen after the meeting of the party’s State Executive Committee earlier, the Deputy State Chairman of the APC, Kenneth Asekomhe, noted, “After the meeting of the State Executive Committee, in pursuant of Article 17, Section 5 of APC constitution of 2014, as amended, we the undersigned members passed a vote of no confidence on the State Secretary of the party, Mr. Lawrence Okah.

“He is hereby removed from office.”

“The committee also passed a vote of confidence on the state chairman of APC, Mr. Anselm Ojezua.”
