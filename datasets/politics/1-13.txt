Lagos PDP gets new executive despite court order
Mudiaga Affe

The Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos State on Wednesday elected Mr Deji Doherty as its new chairman.

The election, which was organised by a special election committee set up by the National Working Committee of the party, was supervised by Senator Ben Obi and others.

The party went ahead to conduct the exercise despite an order of a Lagos State High Court which on Tuesday restrained the NWC from conducting the election on the grounds that existing state executive members, led by Dr Dominic Adegbola, were not carried along, among others.

Justice T.A.O. Oyekan-Abdullai ordered the parties to maintain the status quo until November 18 when the motion on notice will be argued.

However, Obi said out of the 68 delegates approved by the NWC only 45 voted during the election held at a hotel in the Maryland area of Ikeja, Lagos.

Other winners were Showole Jubril (state party vice-chairman), Amode Akeem (organising secretary), Adeniyi Rotimi (assistant organising secretary, Muyideen Tejumade (legal adviser), Olalekan Akeem (assistant legal adviser), Olayinka Dada (assistant secretary), Kolawole Mike (party chairman, Apapa Local Government Area) and Akojemu Florence (party chairman, Badagry LGA).
