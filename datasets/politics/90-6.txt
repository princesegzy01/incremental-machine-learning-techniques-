Tribunal affirms Gombe lawmaker’s election
Chima Azubuike, Gombe

The Election Petitions Tribunal has dismissed the application filed by Aishatu Ahmed of the Peoples Democratic Party against the declaration of Usman Kumo of the All Progressives Congress as the winner of the February 23 election for Akko Federal Constituency, Gombe State, organised by the Independent National Electoral Commission.

In its ruling on Friday, the tribunal dismissed the application for lack of merit.

In a judgment read by Justice Nurudeen Abdullahi, the tribunal said, “There was no time that the 1st respondent was disqualified in the eyes of the law. So, the application has collapsed like a pack of cards. The issue is therefore resolved in favour of the respondents; this will automatically resolve the issues in their favour.”

The judge added, “The petition failed for lack of merit. The petition is dismissed.”
