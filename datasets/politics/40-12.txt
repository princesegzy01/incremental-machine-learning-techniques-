Ogun may establish two varsities

The Ogun State Government has said it is addressing the agitation of the people of the west and central senatorial zones to have a university cited in their domains.

Governor Dapo Abiodun made this known at a one day stakeholders forum with the theme, ‘Repositioning Education for Outstanding Performance,’ in Abeokuta.

Abiodun said, “We have been able to settle the Moshood Abiola Polytechnic issue. It is a win-win for everybody. If the people of Ogun Central still want a University, they will have it and if the people of Ogun West say they want a university they will have. But we are going to take it one step at a time and also consider the financial position of the state,” he said.

“In the past, Ogun State’s position used to be in a digit, but now we are at the bottom five. This is unacceptable as the state is known to be first in every facets of our nation life. We cannot continue and we are doing everything possible to reverse the trend.”

Abiodun, while saying teaching and learning condition in public schools would be improved upon, added that teachers and non teaching staff would be trained and retrained in latest teaching methods and schools’ administration.
