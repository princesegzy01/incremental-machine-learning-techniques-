UPDATE: Supreme Court may deliver judgement on presidential election today
Ade Adesomoju, Abuja

A seven-man panel of the Supreme Court on Wednesday receded to chambers after hearing the Peoples Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, leaving the bar and the audience in a state of confusion about what the next move would be.

Atiku and his party had filed their appeal before the apex court to challenge the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari at the February 23, 2019 poll.

The Chief Justice Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, said after the end of the hearing on Wednesday, “the court will rise to reconstitute.”

Generally, the court uses the word, “reconstitute” to inform the bar and others present that the departing panel is leaving to give way for a new one which may or may not include one or more members of the departing panel.

But senior lawyers in the court, who remained in the courtroom after the departure of the CJN-led explained that the use of the word, “reconstitute” by the CJN was a slip as he actually meant to say the court would “reconvene”.

By the explanation offered by the senior lawyers, the panel is likely coming back to deliver its judgment on the appeal.
