APC, PDP clash over Makinde’s N10bn loan
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The All Progressives Congress in Oyo State on Wednesday attacked the state House of Assembly for approving N10bn loan for Governor Seyi Makinde.

The APC, in a press statement by its PRO, Dr Abdul-Azeez Olatunde said the development showed, the naivety of the Assembly members.

The APC said, “Has the state budget been reviewed? The manner of passing the loan request clearly exposed the naivety of both the executive and the legislature of the Pacesetter State.”

But the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Akeem Olatunji, said the loan was to be used to sanitise Oyo State from the “odious mess caused by the previous regime of Governor Abiola Ajimobi. Therefore, the statement credited to the APC is watery and baseless.”

“We challenge the APC to give details of loans obtained by the last administration of Ajimobi and clarify to the citizens exactly what those loans were used for.

“The era of taking loans and diverting it to private pockets or keeping it in private accounts to yield interests and later share it among corrupt individuals is gone for good,” the PDP said.
