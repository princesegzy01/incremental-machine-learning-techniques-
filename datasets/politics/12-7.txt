‘We’ll challenge Okorocha’s senatorial seat to Supreme Court’
Friday Olokor, Abuja

The Independent National Electoral Commission on Wednesday said it had appealed the judgement of a Federal High Court on the Imo West Senatorial election with a view to recovering the Certificate of Return issued to a former governor of Imo state, Owelle Rochas Okorocha.

The commission also said the November 16 governorship election Bayelsa and Kogi states would not be postponed due to logistics.

The Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who stated these at the quarterly meeting with Abuja Bureau Chiefs and media executives, said the commission would pursue Okorocha’s case to the Supreme Court as it did not give the Certificate of Return to the former governor.

“I don’t see how logistics can mar the elections in Bayelsa and Kogi to the extent that we have to postpone. It has to be some major issues for that to happen,” he said.

Yakubu said if the Okorocha case went unchallenged in the court, “politicians will no longer mobilise voters or even buy votes during any election but will prefer to buy guns and move to collation centres and get declarations made in their favour.”
