Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has appointed 60 new Special Advisers about five months to the end of his tenure.

Dickson has appointed over 2,350 political appointees since his re-election for second tenure in 2016.

A statement on Thursday by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, said the governor approved the appointments “as part of deliberate efforts to enable the restoration government to finish strong.”

Soriwei said the new 60 political appointees, who were drawn from all the eight local government areas of the state, would be sworn in on Monday.
