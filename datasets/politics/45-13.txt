Appeal court dismisses case against Ondo senator
Peter Dada, Akure

The Court of Appeal sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Monday dismissed the petition filed by the United People’s Congress Party, which sought the nullification of the victory of Senator Nicholas Tofowomo, representing Ondo-South Senatorial District at the Senate.

The Federal High Court had earlier struck out the application filed by the candidate of the Action Alliance in the senatorial election, Mr Olatunji Felder, who prayed the court to nullify the victory of Tofowomo. He contended that the conduct of supplementary election of March 9, 2019 by the Independent National Electoral Commission in Ondo-South was flawed because INEC did not write officially to inform parties before conducting the rerun.

Not satisfied with the judgment of the lower court, the UPCP filed an appeal at the appellate court to challenge the high court judgment.

In a unanimous judgment delivered by the trio of Justices M.A. Danjuma, R.M. Abdullahi and P.A. Mahmood, the Court of Appeal dismissed the petition of the UPCP, saying, “It lacks merit.”

The court also awarded the sum of N300,000 cost against the appellant.

INEC had declared the February 23, 2019 senatorial election inconclusive. The commission ordered for a supplementary election which was held on March 9, 2019.

At the end of the supplementary election, the commission declared Tofowomo the winner with 81,892 votes while Yele Omogunwa of the All Progressives Congress polled 55,610 votes and Olatunji Felder of the Action Alliance scored 27,150 votes.
