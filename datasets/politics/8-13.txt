Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun on Monday promised that the state government would verify all appointments made by his immediate predecessor Ibikunle Amosun.

Abiodun made the promise while receiving the report of the review committee on appointment and employment in the state between February 1 and May 29, 2019,

Amosun had approved some appointments a few weeks to the end of his tenure.

Abiodun, on assumption of office, set up the review committee.

The governor commended the committee for its commitment and timely completion of the assignment.

He said, “The necessary verification will be carried out after a critical look at the report.”

He said his government would continue to engage the services of retired Heads of Service and Permanent Secretaries to ensure that things were done according to the civil service rules.
