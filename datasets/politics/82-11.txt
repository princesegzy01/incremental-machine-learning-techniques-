APC passes confidence vote in Ajimobi, Oke
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The All Progressives Congress in Oyo State has passed a vote of confidence in the former Governor of the state, Senator Abiola Ajimobi.

The APC members at the end of their extended State Executive Council meeting attended by 32 of the 33 local government party chairmen across the state also passed a vote of confidence in the state chairman, Chief Akin Oke.

There had been calls by some members of the party for new leadership to reposition the party for future electoral victories following the dismal performance of the party at the state in the recently concluded 2019 elections.

But a communique made available to The PUNCH on Thursday in Ibadan by the party’s spokesman, Dr AbdulAzeez Olatunde, said the meeting appraised the pre-election, election and post-election events and praised the chairman and the state working committee.

The communiqué read in part, “The party charged the local government party chairmen to raise a local government reconciliation committee to reconcile all aggrieved party aspirants and members in line with a similar exercise being set up at the state level.

“Members were updated on various petitions before various tribunals and members were happy that judgments delivered so far have been justifying the integrity values which APC symbolises.”

The party mandated the party chairmen to warn members against setting up caucus groups and that anybody that went against the directive should be disciplined in line with the party’s constitution, no matter how highly placed.
