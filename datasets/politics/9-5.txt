PDP campaign vehicle kills four in Kogi
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

A G-Wagon on the campaign trail of the Peoples Democratic Party on Saturday ran into a kiosk and killed all four occupants.

This is the second incident in two weeks, as a similar accident occurred during which two people were killed on the Ankpa/Ayingba Road.

The incident was said to have occurred in Idah, the ancestral headquarters of Igala kingdom.

The G-Wagon was said to be a back-up vehicle for the PDP governorship candidate, Musa Wada.

The Chief Administrator of the Idah Local Government, Area of the state, Hilary Amodu, in a statement by his media aide, Idachaba Muhammed, said the driver of the vehicle was reckless.

The administrator was quoted as saying, “This kind of reckless driving that has been going on in Idah in the name of political rallies is no longer going to be entertained.”

It was, however, gathered that the driver and the passengers of the vehicle were in critical condition at an undisclosed hospital.

A witness, who did not want his name in print, said the presence of men of a security joint task force prevented the driver from being lynched.

Efforts to get the reaction of the police was not successful as of the time of filling this report.

However, the Publicity Secretary, Musa Wada/Aro Campaign Organisation, Faruk Adejoh, said two people died and one was injured in the accident.

Adejoh said, “Accidents do happen, but it is sheer mischief for anyone to ascribe it to recklessness. No one prays for such a calamity.”
