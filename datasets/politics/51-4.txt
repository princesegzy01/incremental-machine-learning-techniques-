Tony Okafor, Awka

The Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Awka, the Anambra State capital, has upheld the elections of Senators Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Peoples Party and Uche Ekwunife of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Anambra South Senatorial District and Anambra Central Senatorial District respectively.

While the oil mogul defeated Chris Uba of the Peoples Democratic Party and Andy Uba of the All Progressives Congress at the tribunal, Senator Ekwunife defeated Victor Umeh of the All Progressives Grand Alliance.

Umeh had challenged the declaration of Ekwunife by the Independent National Electoral Commission, stating that she was not properly nominated by her party, while the Uba brothers alleged that the election of Ifeanyi Ubah was characterised by violence.

Umeh in his reaction asked his supporters to remain calm.

He said, “Thank you very much for your faith and indomitable spirit! We shall prayerfully approach the Court Of Appeal after reviewing the judgment! It was like this on 9th October 2015. Today is another 9th! Let us not despair. God bless.”
