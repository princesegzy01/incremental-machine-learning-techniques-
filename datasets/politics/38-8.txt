Nasarawa gov floors ex-minister Maku at Supreme Court
Umar Muhammed, Lafia

The Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has recorded another victory after the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal filed by the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in the 2019 general election, Mr Labaran Maku.

Justices of the Supreme Court upheld both the verdicts of the tribunal, as well as that of the Court of Appeal, affirming Sule’s election.

A statement issued by Mr Abubakar Imam, Legal Adviser to the governor on Wednesday, said the judgment of the apex court brought to an end the legal battle over the Independent National Electoral Commission’s declaration and return of Sule as duly elected governor of Nasarawa State, having scored majority of valid and lawful vote cast during the March 9 governorship election.

The legal adviser described the Supreme Court judgement as not only a victory for democracy but for the state and the All Progressive Congress family.
