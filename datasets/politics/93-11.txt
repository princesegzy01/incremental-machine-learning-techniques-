Stop accusing Akwa Ibom panel chair falsely, PDP tells APC
Patrick Odey, Uyo

The Akwa Ibom State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party has asked its All Progressives Congress counterpart to stop demanding the resignation of the Chairman, Panel 2 of the National and State Houses of Assembly Tribunal for Akwa Ibom State, Justice Jennifer Ijohor, on a false claim that her husband, Prof Tony Ijohor (SAN), is a card-carrying member of the PDP. The PDP on Sunday said there was no legal requirement, which stipulated the membership of a political party as the basis for appointment.

The state Chairman of the APC, Ini Okopido, had, at a briefing held last Saturday, called for the resignation of the tribunal chairman on the allegation that, as the wife of the Secretary to the Benue State Government under the PDP, she would not be objective in the discharge of her duties. But the PDP, in a swift reaction by its Publicity Secretary, Ini Ememobong, said there was no evidence that the tribunal chairman’s husband was a card carrying member of the party.
