An investment Bank, FSL Securities Limited, has promised to raise N100bn for infrastructural development of Imo State.

According to a statement by the media aide to the State Deputy Governor Gerald Irona, Walter Duru, the firm made the promise when it visited Irona.

The statement said, “FSL Securities Limited has offered to assist the Imo State Government in raising about N100bn for infrastructural development in the state.

“The group made the disclosure during a meeting with the Deputy Governor of Imo State, Gerald Irona, at the Government House, Owerri, on Tuesday.

“In his presentation, the Group Managing Director of the organisation, Chris Okenwa, described the present administration in the state as “showing positive signs of good and responsible governance, hence the offer.”

Irona, in his reaction, was said to have reiterated the commitment of the Emeka Ihedioha-led administration to entrenching good governance in the state, assuring the organisation of the government’s readiness to create an enabling environment for investment in the state.

He added, “We need some level of funding intervention. We inherited a state with high level of infrastructural decay.

“We are glad that you are here to provide alternative sources of funding other than the statutory federal allocation. I assure you that the government of Imo State shall partner you.”
