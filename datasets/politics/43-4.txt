Emmanuel wins at poll panel
Patrick Odey, Uyo

The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, on Thursday upheld the election of Governor Udom Emmanuel, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic party, as the winner of the March 9 election in the state.

The Chairman of the three-man panel, Justice A.M. Yakubu, in a unanimous judgment in Uyo, dismissed all the evidences of the petitioner, adding that “without oral evidence to confirm how the materials were arrived at, such evidences are considered as being dumped in the tribunal.”

Citing the Supreme Court in the case of Nweke v INEC, the court ruled that “documentary evidence, however daring, cannot be thrown on the tribunal without oral evidence linking the documents to the issues in the petitioners’ case.”

The panel held that the petitioners, having abandoned their prayers, where they had claimed that the first petitioner, Obong Ekere, who was the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, was the winner of the elections, all the evidence given in efforts to substantiate the said ground was expunged from the considerations of the court in the judgment.

According to the panel, the petitioners failed to follow the laid down rules in front-loading and listing all documents they sought to rely on in proof of their petition.
