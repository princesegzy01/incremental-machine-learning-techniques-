The Counsel to INEC, Mr Adedayo Adedeji, prayed the tribunal to dismiss the application filed by the petitioners as it lacked merit and was incompetent.

Adedeji filed a motion to set aside the contempt proceedings that were initiated by the petitioners and also filed a preliminary objection urging the court to strike out the Petitions.

Counsel to Abdullahi Ganduje, Aliyu Umar, SAN, also prayed the tribunal to strike out the petition for lack of merit.

Earlier, the Counsel to the petitioners, Adebayo Owomolo, had made an application for withdrawal of two applications out of the five motions filed before the tribunal.

In her ruling, Justice Halima Mohammed announced the adoption of all petitions and counter-affidavits filed by the petitioners.

She adjourned the case until July 13, for ruling on the pending application and continuation of hearing.
