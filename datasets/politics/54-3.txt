‘Bayelsa APC primaries a mockery of democracy’
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

A contender for the governorship ticket of the All Progressives Congress in Bayelsa State, Mr Preye Aganaba, has rejected the outcome of the party’s direct primary conducted on Wednesday, describing the exercise as a sham.

Aganaba, in a statement on Thursday, noted that the primary poll, which produced Mr David Lyon as the candidate of the APC, was a “travesty of democratic process” and lacked “any iota of credibility and integrity.”

According to him, the results were written in a hotel in Yenagoa, the state capital.

He added that such brazen mockery of a fair political contest was not acceptable.

The aspirant said, “The process leading to the direct primary election was rife with irregularities and has set a bad precedent for a political party that prides itself as a progressive, which is supposed to lead by example.

“Engr. Preye Aganaba did not partake in the September 4 APC governorship primary election because there was no election. The degrading votes allotted to him is a complete fabrication and designed to ridicule him and his supporters.”
