APC suspends aspirant for criticising Kebbi gov on radio programme
The All Progressive Congress in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area of Kebbi State, has suspended a council chairmanship aspirant, Shafiu Abubakar, over unlawful utterances.

Chairman of Zouro ward in Birnin Kebbi, Umaru Bakatara, disclosed this on Sunday at a Press briefing in Birnin Kebbi.

“This is to inform you that, following the unguided and disrespectful utterances by Shafiu Abubakar on the government of APC Kebbi State on Saturday through vision FM Radio interview, the party has suspended him from the party and we wish to inform you that APC Zauro Ward has disassociated itself and its not in any way in support of his actions.

“The leadership of the Ward wishes to register its unflinching support and loyalty to the constituted authorities of the government of Kebbi State under the leadership of Governor Abubakar Bagudu.”

Abubakar, however, told News Agency of Nigeria that his suspension was null and void.

He said the Zauro Ward executives of the party have no jurisdiction under the law to suspend him for merely expressing his views as enshrined in the Constitution.

“The suspension is baseless, null and void. They do not have the power under our great party, APC, to suspend me; and Nigeria’s Constitution gave me freedom of speech, which I used to express my feelings on issues relating to my state,” he said.
