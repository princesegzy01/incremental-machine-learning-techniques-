“I clearly understand the challenges of governance and (I’m) better placed to continue and consolidate on the achievements of Dickson, especially in the education and health sectors,’’ John-Jonah said.

He also encouraged the party to provide a level-playing ground for all aspirants and play by the rules, saying that there should be no preferred aspirant in order to avoid divisiveness within the ranks of the party.

Retired Col. Austin Akobundu, National Organising Secretary of the PDP, who handed over the forms to the deputy governor, promised to ensure a seamless transition in Bayelsa.
