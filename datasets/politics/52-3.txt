Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has picked his Chief of Staff, Edward David Onoja as his running mate in the November 16 governorship election.

Governor Bello emerged the candidate of All Progressives Congress at the party’s primary on 29th August.

Informed sources told our correspondent on Sunday in Lokoja that the APC National Secretariat has cleared Onoja as Bello’s running mate.

Although Onoja’s pictures had accompanied Bello’s in all posters in the build-up to the party’s primary, it was gathered that the arrangement was only approved on Friday after the meeting of the APC chairman, Adams Oshiomole with President Muhammadu Buhari.

Onoja, a Geology graduate and a former banker has always been a formidable force to reckon with and have been the face of the government headed by Bello.

When contacted, the Director General, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Kingsley Fanwo said he is yet to be briefed.

He, however, said that it may be true as those who were privy to the nomination forms filled by the Governor at the National Secretariat might have leaked the information.

“Anyway, I think it’s true but I have not been officially briefed, ” Fanwo said.

The state chairman of the party in Kogi State, Abdulahi Bello said that the nomination of the governor and running mate was entirely the responsibility of the National Secretariat and not at the state level.
