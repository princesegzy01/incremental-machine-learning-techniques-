Embattled Bayelsa speaker ‘resigns’
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Bayelsa State House of Assembly has received an official letter of resignation from the embattled former Speaker of the House, Mr Tonye Isenah.

Isenah’s letter was read on the floor of the House by his successor Mr. Monday Bubou-Obolo, during plenary on Monday.

Recall that Isenah was impeached on September 30, 2019, by 17 out of the 18 Peoples Democratic Party lawmakers of the 24-member Assembly following his refusal to resign and in his place, Bubou-Obolo was elected speaker.

The former speaker’s resignation letter was dated September 30, the day he was removed by the lawmakers.

He said the resignation became “necessary for peace to reign and for the greater good of the state.”

The Majority Leader and House Committee Chairman on Information, Mr Bernard Kenebai, moved the motion for Isenah’s letter to be accepted and adopted as a working document of the House and was seconded by Mitema Obordor.

The Speaker thanked members for their understanding, noting that they had once again demonstrated that they could subordinate their personal interests to the interest of the state.
