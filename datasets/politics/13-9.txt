Lalong advises commissioners on service delivery
James Abraham, Jos

The Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, has urged the state commissioners to take advantage of their appointments to harness the numerous resources available in the state.

Lalong spoke in Jos on Tuesday during a retreat held for the commissioners and other top government officials.

Lalong said, “For many of our citizens, the question on their minds are; what do these policy objectives mean? How will they impact positively on their living standards? How soon will they begin to see the manifest and tangible evidence of this vision?

“These and many more are the questions that we need to answer at this retreat as we sit down to plan, review, discuss, strategise, and project on what we need to put in place to get the desired answers for those who elected us and to whom we are accountable.

“I therefore expect that this retreat will take a broad look at the state of the economy of Plateau State and discuss the plans to reposition it in line with the Economic Rebirth Vision of the Rescue Administration.”
