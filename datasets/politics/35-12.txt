 INEC loses Taraba REC
Friday Olokor, Abuja

With about five weeks to the November 6 governorship election in Bayelsa and Kogi States, a major tragedy had afflicted the Independent National Electoral Commission with the death of its Resident Electoral Commissioner for Taraba State, Alhaji Baba Abba Yusuf.

Although the details of the incident were still sketchy, a terse statement issued on Sunday by the INEC Secretary, Rose Oriarian-Anthony, said the REC died on Saturday night at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Borno State, where he had been on admission.

The statement reads, “The Independent National Electoral Commission regrets to announce the death of the Resident Electoral Commissioner for Taraba State, Alhaji Baba Abba Yusuf.

“He died last (Saturday) night at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, Borno State, where he was on admission for sometime. He will be buried today Sunday September 29 2019 at 4pm in Maiduguri. The commission will be represented at the funeral by a delegation of National Commissioners and Resident Electoral Commissioners.

“Alhaji Yusuf was one of the most experienced RECs in the commission, having been appointed in 2010. He had served as REC in Benue and Adamawa States. His experience has been invaluable to the Commission over the years. May God grant him eternal rest and give the family the fortitude to bear the great loss.”
