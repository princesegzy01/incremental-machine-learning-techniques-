Dankwambo jibes ruling APC, Bello
Chima Azubuike, Gombe

A former governor of Gombe State, Dr Ibrahim Dankwambo, has broken his silence on the governorship election in Kogi State.

The immediate past governor, who is a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, through his verified Twitter account, @HEDankwambo, called on incumbent Governor Yahaya Bello and the ruling All Progressives Congress to be true to self, adding that the debt owed by the governor was a likely hindrance to his return.

The two-term governor noted that the PDP had performed “excellently.”

He said, “APC wants Kogi people to vote their candidate who is owing workers over 30 months’ salaries despite bailout funds, while at the same time asking Bayelsans to vote out PDP, where civil servants are not being owed and where our party has performed excellently well.”

Dankwambo had hitherto taken a silent stance since his failed senatorial ambition.

However, a follower with the handle, Musa Ahmed @Kempez2017, in his response, said, “But you campaigned for Ikpeazu of Abia and Ortom of Benue State despite having a backlog of salaries on their necks with lack of infrastructure.

“Hence, even Bayelsa State is owing pensioners eight years’ pension arrears. What are you taking about?”

Another user, @Abudah, said, “Sir, Kogi State is beyond redemption right now. It’s not even about parties anymore; the PDP administration before this one owed salaries too.”
