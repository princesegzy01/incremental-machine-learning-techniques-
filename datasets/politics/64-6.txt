The lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Senator Uba Sani, has said he will not take for granted the decision of the people of his constituency to elect him in the 2019 elections.

Sani, of the All Progressives Congress, was reacting to the tribunal judgement which validated his victory at the poll, vowing to fulfil his electoral promises.

The State and National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal had during the week dismissed the petition of the candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party, Senator Shehu Sani, challenging the outcome of the February 2019 elections in Kaduna Central won by Uba. The tribunal, chaired by Justice A.H. Suleiman, had dismissed Shehu’s petition for lacking merit.

Speaking on his victory, Uba said he had devised a mechanism to ensure that the dividends of democracy were delivered to members of his constituency.

“This (mechanism) has been perfected. In no distant time, the real dividends of democracy will be at your doorsteps,” he added.

Uba, in a post on his verified Facebook page, said, “I will never be distracted by the hurdles ahead.

“Your decision to elect me to represent you at the Red Chamber will never be taken for granted as I have devised a mechanism to implement my promises to you.”

Uba won the National Assembly poll with 355,242 votes in February. While the Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate, Lawal Adamu, scored 195,497 votes, PRP’s Shehu came a distant third with 70,613 votes.
