Oshiomhole disowns presidential campaign posters
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has disowned the 2023 presidential campaign posters bearing his picture and name.

The former Edo governor, who said he was not aware of the posters, described the situation as the handiwork of mischief makers.

Oshiomhole spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Simon Egbebulem, in a reaction to an inquiry by our correspondent.

He said, “The posters allegedly in circulation are handiworks of mischief workers who are hell bent on circulating materials to cause confusion in the polity.

“They are obviously looking for ways to set members of the ruling against themselves. The supposed posters have no approval of my principal and should be ignored for whatever it is worth. It is the merchants of lies at work as usual and they deserve no attention.”
