SDP says pact with Osun APC not threatened
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Osun State chapter of the Social Democratic Party has said that the coalition between it and the ruling All Progressives Congress is not threatened.

The spokesperson for the SDP in the state, Taiwo Akeju, stated this in an interview with our correspondent on Tuesday.

Akeju said even with the declaration by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola that no opposition party member would be appointed into his cabinet, the SDP still believed that the coalition between it and the APC was still intact.

He said the party would not discuss further details of the coalition with the media.

Oyetola had said Monday that he would not appoint any opposition member into his cabinet.

He had explained that bringing opposition members into the cabinet may cause problem which he would want to avoid since his government wanted to work with the APC manifestoes.

Akeju said, “Our coalition with the APC is not threatened. We heard the statement credited to the governor and our reaction is that we are still in the coalition. We won’t discuss our matter on the pages of newspaper.”
