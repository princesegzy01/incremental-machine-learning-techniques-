PDP felicitates with Kogi at 28
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The Kogi State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has felicitated with the people of the state on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the creation of the state.

The Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, Bode Ogunmola,said the PDP lauded the vision of the founding fathers of the state.

He commended the resilience and courage of the citizens and noted that the state had rich history and culture.

The party remarked that though the state was going through a hard time under the present All Progressives Congress leadership, it assured that there would be “light after the dark tunnel”.

While insisting that the state under the APC was witnessing its roughest moment, the PDP urged the people to keep hope and faith that “tomorrow would be better”.

The state, the party said, is endowed, but had been held down by poor governance, especially as it was being experienced under Governor Yahaya Bello.

“We are promising renewed hope. As a party, we have shown stronger commitment to the Kogi project and we are promising to keep the torch even higher,” the statement added.
