Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Independent National Electoral Commission has assured the Ekiti State Independent Electoral Commission of support in the conduct of election into the 16 area councils of the state.

The election is fixed for December shortly before the expiration of the tenure of the current council officials.

The INEC’s Administrative Secretary in Ekiti State, Dr Muslim Omoleke, said the support to EKSIEC was in line with the existing Memorandum of Understanding between the two electoral bodies.

Omoleke, who spoke in Ado Ekiti on Friday while receiving the EKSIEC Chairman, Justice Jide Aladejana, said, “INEC is ready to deepen democracy at all levels, so the conduct of local government election is very important and we shall do our best to support you.”

He said INEC as the custodian of voter’s register and Permanent Voter Cards, would do the needful at the appropriate time, but advised EKSIEC to formalise such request.
