We’ll floor APC in Bayelsa polls – PDP
Success Nwogu,

The Peoples Democratic Party on Tuesday said it would floor the All Progressives Congress in the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa and Kogi States.

The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, during a media briefing in Abuja, stated that Bayelsa State remained the PDP stronghold, adding that the Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, had delivered dividends of democracy and good governance such that the state would remain a PDP state.

He also said the party was poised to reclaim Kogi State from the APC as he alleged that the state governor, Yahaya Bello, had foisted hardship, insecurity, lack of development and retrogression on the state.

He said, “ Bayelsa is the traditional home of the PDP, we are in democracy so the APC has right to run an election, but there is no way that Bayelsan will vote for the APC. Bayesians will not do that.

“In Kogi, we advise Governor Bello to begin to write his handover note because the PDP will remove the incumbent, Bello. Kogi people for your information cannot be bought with money.”
