VAT: Stop raising false alarm, BMO tells PDP
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The Buhari Media Organisation has cautioned the Peoples Democratic Party against raising false alarm, especially over matters that it does not have full understanding of.

The group gave the advice while reacting to the PDP’s rejection of the Federal Government’s plan to increase the Value Added Tax from five per cent to 7.5 per cent .

It urged the PDP not to undermine a patriotic and genuine effort of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to raise the needed resources to address some of the major infrastructural needs of Nigerians.

The PDP had earlier called on the Federal Government to reverse its decision to increase VAT, and that such planned increase would put more pressure on families and businesses.

But the BMO in a statement signed by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, said the PDP was not genuinely worried that Nigerians could not bear the burden of the 2.2 per cent marginal increase in VAT under the prevailing economic situation in the country.
