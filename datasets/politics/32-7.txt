Anambra to fund 2020 budget with refund from FG
Tony Okafor, Awka

Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, has said the state government expects a refund of N10bn from the Federal Government for works done on federal roads in the state.

He said his 2020 Budget estimate of N137bn would be partly funded from the expected refund.

The governor stated this in his budget breakdown for the 2020 fiscal year.

“We expect to receive N10bn as reimbursements from the Federal Government for works done on federal roads out of the amount owed the state,” he said.

The governor added, “Value Added Tax revenue projection is pegged at N15.5bn annually, which is a 46% increase from the 2019 figure of N10.6bn.

“Internally Generated Revenues are projected at N2.5bn monthly (N30.0bn annually) compared with the current actual run rate of N1.48bn monthly (N17.8bn annually).

“We plan to achieve this by optimising our IGR windows through continuous enumeration and automation as well as strengthening our enforcement initiatives in the state and sustaining the growth of our tax database.”
