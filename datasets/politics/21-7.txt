Kogi, Bayelsa gov polls: APC inaugurates 112-member campaign council
The All Progressives Congress has inaugurated its National Campaign Council to complement the efforts of campaign committees set up for the November 16 Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections.

The National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole, who inaugurated the council in Abuja on Friday, said that Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa would chair a 56-council member for Bayelsa, while Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State would lead 56 members for Kogi.

Oshiomhole, who said all APC governors would participate in the campaign, said the party would also deploy its human resources to Kogi and Bayelsa to deliver the two states for the party.

“This inauguration demonstrates the party’s readiness to campaign and contest the election,” APC National chairman said.

Speaking on behalf of the council, El-Rufai thanked the party’s National Working Committee for appointing him as chairman of the National Campaign Council for Kogi election.

He pledged that his campaign council would be committed to delivering the state to the party.

The governor, who said that re-election of a governor was always tougher than fresh election, said his campaign council would ensure re-election of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi through performance, reconciliation and consultation.

Badaru, who was represented by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, expressed the council’s readiness to complement the efforts of Bayelsa Campaign Organisation to ensure victory for the party.
