Rainfall won’t stop Ogun road repairs –Abiodun

The Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, has said rehabilitation of bad roads in the state will not stop because of continual rainfall and flooding.

The governor said he had already directed the Ogun Public Works Agency to double down in its efforts to fix the bad roads, stressing that rainfall would not be an excuse.

A statement on Monday quoted the state’s consultant on Works and Infrastructure, Ade Akinsanya, to have said on the governor’s behalf, after inspecting some roads affected by rains.

“The emergency order is new adrenalin for the OGPWA to ensure that rain, though a major challenge for rehabilitation works efforts, does not stop the agency from fixing all intra-city roads across Ogun State.

“We are poised to make our people heave a sigh of relief at the earliest possible time. We are only appealing for time to do a thorough job and that is why we are doing the works in phases.

“What we have done is to segment the works into phases. There are some that could be done in the rain. These ones we are doing straightaway. The ones that cannot be done in the rain will have to wait till the rainy season is over. But the governor is pushing us hard to deliver on public works and infrastructure.

“We are even going beyond state and township roads. We have taken it upon ourselves to fix federal roads that run through the state,” Akinsanya said.
