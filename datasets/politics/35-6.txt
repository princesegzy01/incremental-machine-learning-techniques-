Opposition plotting trouble ahead of 2021 gov poll –Obiano
Tony Okafor, Awka

The Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, on Sunday alleged that the opposition in the state was plotting to introduce criminality in the state ahead of the 2021 governorship poll.

The governor said the aim was to rubbish his security arrangements that had been adjudged as one of the best in the country to discredit the All Progressives Grand Alliance in the poll.

This came barely a week after the governor said the Peoples Democratic Party in the state was plotting to destabilise his government, an allegation the PDP chairman in the state, Ndubuisi Nwobu, described as laughable.

In a statement by the state Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, C-Don Adinuba, on Sunday with the title, ‘Stop politicising Anambra’s security,’ Obiano insisted that the opposition was out to discredit him because of the 2021 gov poll in the state.

The statement read in part, “It is embarrassing that as the people and government of Anambra State are preparing to launch on October 11, 2019, the second phase of Operation Mkpochapu (Operation Wipeout Crime) to be led by the Inspector General of Police, Mr Adamu Mohammed, elements of the so-called opposition in the state have launched a counter campaign to scuttle it, so that Anambra will return to the days when it was almost overrun by kidnappers, armed robbers, contract murders and other violent criminals.”
