Voter apathy hinders good governance – LASIEC
Fisayo Odumuyiwa

The Chairman, Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission, retired Justice Ayotunde Phillips, has identified low turnout among eligible voters and general lack of interest in the political process as serious challenges to democracy and good governance in the country.

Philips, at a press briefing in Lagos, described the growing pattern of voter apathy in the country as quite worrisome.

According to a statement by the Head of Public Affairs Unit of the commission, Mr Stephen Ojo, the LASIEC chairman said, “Analysis of the last general election indicated that voters who exercised their civic responsibility across the federation were less than 20 per cent of the total registered voters.”

Phillips noted that electing good leaders was the inalienable obligation that every eligible voter must hold dearly.
