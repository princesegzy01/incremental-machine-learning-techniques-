Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto

A fumigation exercise sponsored by Senator Aliyu Wamakko, who is representing Sokoto North Senatorial District, has commenced at the Sokoto South Local Government Area.

The Special Assistant on media and publicly to Senator Wamakko, Bashir Mani, in a statement on Wednesday, said the exercise which would cost over N8m was inaugurated by the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in the council, Alhaji Bello Mainasara.

Mainasara, according to the statement, described the gesture by Wamakko, as a relief not only to the people of the area, but to the state as a whole.

The chairman extolled the efforts of the Senator for coming up with the exercise, which he said, could not come at a better time than now when the scourge of malaria was endemic.

He said, “There is the need for a collective effort to tackle the malaria menace.”

The leader of the spraying team, Alhaji Sani Bodinga, said his colleagues who had been given the responsibility to undertake the fumigation in the targeted areas would not disappoint the lawmaker and the beneficiaries.

Wamakko, who was represented on the occasion by Dr Bello Wamakko, said the motive behind the exercise was to help the various communities in the state curtail the tide of malaria menace.
