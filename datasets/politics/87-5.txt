MACBAN disowns Fulani vigilantes in Ondo
Peter Dada, Akure

The Miyatti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, Ondo State chapter, has disowned the Fulani vigilantes who had been parading themselves as MACBAN members.

Recall that few days ago, a lawyer, Mr Kayode Ajulo, had posted the pictures of some armed men at a roadblock in the Akoko area of Ondo State. The men had claimed to be members of the MACBAN.

However, MACBAN said the men in the pictures were not members of the group in the state.

Speaking with our correspondent on the telephone, the Chairman of the MACBAN in the state, Alhaji Bello Garuba, said his group had not formed any vigilante group.

He said, “The report is not true and cannot be substantiated. There was never a time our group came together to form any vigilante group; there is nothing we do without carrying the police along.”

Similarly, the Ondo State Police Command denied that it was shielding the Fulani vigilantes.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Femi Joseph, said the command had begun investigation into the matter.

“Our men are already with various local vigilante groups in the state guiding their activities and anyone of them caught disobeying the rules and regulations would be dealt with.”

Joseph said the special team from the office of the Inspector-General of Police was still combing the forest reserves, adding that efforts to arrest the criminals would be successful.
