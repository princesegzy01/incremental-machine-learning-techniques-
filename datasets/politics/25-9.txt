No second term until Obaseki re-issues proclamation –APC leaders
Sola Shittu, Benin

The 11 ward chairmen of the All Progressives Congress in the Owan West Local Government Area of Edo State on Sunday said they would not endorse Governor Godwin Obaseki for a second term until he issued a fresh proclamation for the inauguration of elected members of the state House of Assembly.

The eleven ward chairmen of the council who spoke through their coordinating ward three chairman, Mr Raymond Osumah, declared this after their meeting in Owan West.

The leaders, who declared their loyalty to the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, told the governor that political “rascality” would not earn him a second term.

“Until the governor issues a fresh proclamation, no second term deal. It is even a shame for the governor to have instructed the council chairman to stop the N15,000 stipends being given to ward chairmen because we are not supporting his second term bid. And Frank Ilaboya, our council chairman, is owning the eleven ward chairmen three months which amounted to N495,000. They can eat the money but we stand with Oshiomhole, “he stated.

Osumah dismissed the reports that they had endorsed Obaseki for a second term.

“We want to make it clear that, nothing like that happened. Frank Ilaboya, the council chairman who said it, is being mischievous.

“What we are demanding from Mr Governor is to obey the directives of the National Working Committee of the APC and the National Assembly,” he said.
