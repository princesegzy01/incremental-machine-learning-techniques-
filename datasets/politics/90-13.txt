Lokpobiri picks Bayelsa gov form, demands indirect primary
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

A former Minister of State for Agriculture, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, on Thursday picked the first Expression of Interest and Nomination form for the August 29 primary of the All Progressives Congress.

He received the forms after paying the mandatory N22.5m.

Lokpobiri, who denied any rift with former governor Timipre Sylva, said he was the most prepared and experienced for the job.

He said, “I’m the most prepared and the most experienced with parliamentary and executive experiences. I was the pioneer Speaker of Bayelsa State and two-term senator; I have quality people behind my aspiration.”

Lokpobiri urged the National Working Committee of the APC to adopt indirect primary to ensure that a governorship candidate that would be acceptable to all emerged.

According to him, a free and fair primary will produce a clear winner with the losers seeing no reason to challenge the results.

Lokpobiri advised the APC to pick candidates with no question about his integrity if the party desired to win the November 16 governorship election.
