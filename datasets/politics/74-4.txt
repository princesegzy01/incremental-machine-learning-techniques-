Olaleye Aluko, Abuja

The Nigerian Air Force said on Sunday that three of its Alpha jets bombed a location of the Islamic State of West Africa province fighters at Kollaram, a settlement on the fringes of Lake Chad in northern Borno State.

NAF said the bombings killed scores of the terrorists and destroyed their buildings, adding that they were carried out by the Air Task Force of the Operation Lafiya Dole under Exercise Green Sweep 3.

The NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said in a statement that the air force would continue to operate with surface forces to go after the terrorists in the North-East.

He said, “The Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole neutralised several ISWAP fighters at multiple locations within Kollaram. The operation was targeted at three compounds in the area, where the human intelligence indicated that the ISWAP fighters were concentrated.

“Consequently, following confirmatory ISR missions, the ATF scrambled three Alpha jet aircraft to attack the locations. The jets hit the desired points of impact of the targets, causing damage to the buildings and neutralising dozens of the terrorists.”
