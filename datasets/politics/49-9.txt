Oyetola’s achievements will shock you, APC tells PDP
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Osun State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress has said Peoples Democratic Party in the state will be shocked by the level of achievements that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola will record in the next two years.

The APC stated this in a statement by its Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Mr. Kunle Oyatomi, in response to a statement by the state PDP Chairman, Mr. Soji Adagunodo.

Adagunodo had told Governor Oyetola to face governance and stop working towards creating the kind of continuity of governance being experienced in Lagos.

The statement read in part, “Adagunodo was naive to think that what was and continues to be done in Lagos cannot be achieved in Osun.

“It is a pity Adagunodo cannot understand that continuity is already in progress in Osun and this is early success for governor Oyetola who only now has to follow through on Aregbesola’s achievements to sustain the momentum of project delivery that is life changing for the people of the state.

“Governor Oyetola did not make the pledge like someone suffering from a pang of conscience, but he exuded the confidence of legitimacy as he celebrated the victory confirmed by the Supreme Court of the land.”
