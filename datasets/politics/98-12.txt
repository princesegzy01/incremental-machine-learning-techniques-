“My plea to the leadership of our party is to ensure that the party remains united in order to form a formidable front to win this election.

The Chairman of APC in Bayelsa, Mr Jothan Amos, said that the primary to choose the governorship candidate would be free and fair.

He urged all aspirants to carry out their consultations peacefully, without any form of violence.
