‘APC will capture Anambra in 2021’
Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki

The Minister of Science and Technology Innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, has said the All Progressives Congress will “capture” Anambra State in 2021 and other states in the South-East geopolitical zone in future elections.

Onu said the strategic leadership qualities of President Muhammadu Buhari had left everybody within the South-East and across the country to start “thinking APC and see the party as a true agent of changes that Nigeria needs.”

The minister stated this during a thanksgiving service for his reappointment by the President, at his country home, Uburu, in the Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, adding that the South-East would benefit more if it aligned itself with the ruling party, than played opposition.

He said, “Mr President thinks very well of Ebonyi State and the entire zone. Mr President is working on all the major roads, whether from Onitsha to Enugu or from Enugu to Port Harcourt.

“The Second Niger Bridge that is always used for political campaigns by previous administrations is no longer used for political campaigns. It is now becoming a reality. If you go there from Onitsha or you are coming from Lagos to Asaba, you will see that work is going on there. No more politics with it.”

He stated that Buhari had approved N10bn for the repair of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu.

“This is almost double the amount he approved for the repair of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.

“The Minister of Aviation has assured the people of the South-East that on or before the first quarter of 2020, the airport would be ready for use again,” Onu added.
