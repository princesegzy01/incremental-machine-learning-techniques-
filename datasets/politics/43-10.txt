Buhari replaces embattled Oyo-Ita, ex-HoS faces EFCC
Friday Olokor, Abuja

President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan as the acting Head of the Civil Service of the Federation with immediate effect.

The decision has therefore put an end to the career of the current occupant of the seat, Winifred Oyo-Ita who had been in the eye of the storm over alleged N3bn bribery and falsification of duty tour allowance.

The President’s decision was conveyed in a statement on Wednesday by the Director of Information in the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Willie Bassey.

The statement said Oyo-Ita had been directed to proceed on an indefinite leave to allow conclusion of the investigation being carried out by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.

The President also directed the OHCSF to commence the process for the selection of new permanent secretaries.
