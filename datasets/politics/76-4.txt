The party immediately announced Leonard Nzenwa as Sowore’s successor.

The motion for their expulsion was supported by Nasiru Abdulrahman.

Ezeife said that Sowore should not be allowed to continue to bring public shame to AAC.

Speaking after he was sworn in, the new Chairman, Nzenwa said that he would not be the kind of chairman Sowore was.

He said, “The AAC is poised to take over power in 2023 through the ballot and not through any unconstitutional means. We acknowledge the constitutional rights of citizens to peaceful protest against government but we are aware that this constitutional right does not include the right to resort to unconstitutional take over of the government of the country or any part thereof.

“We dissociate the party from any move to unconstitutionally topple the government and any individual who may have done that in the name of the party did so without our consent and clearly did not do so in the name of the party or on its behalf. “
