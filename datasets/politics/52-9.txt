Sola Shittu

Amid the alleged suspension of the Secretary to the Government of Edo State, Mr Osarodion Ogie, from the ruling All Progressives Congress, Governor Godwin Obaseki on Saturday threw his weight behind him with a vote of confidence in him.

Ogie was allegedly suspended by a group within the APC, Ikpoba-Okah Liberation Movement, in the Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the state where he comes from.

But Obaseki, who paid the SSG a solidarity visit at his residence in Benin said the state chapter of the party is intact and insisted that only God makes leaders, despite plans of some persons to cause disunity in the party.

While stressing his support for Ogie, who is the APC leader in the area, said his administration was working with the party to deliver results to Edo people.

He, however, warned that thuggery would not be condoned in the party and the stats, adding that his administration would not be distracted by the antics of some members.

“I am bringing jobs for the youth, especially in the Ologbo-axis of Ikpoba Okha. Youths should organise themselves into units and I will empower you with different skills and training to do the jobs we are creating. For the ongoing renovation of basic schools, youths will be in charge of the fencing work while women will be in charge of furniture,” he said.
