Oyo PDP hails court ruling on LGs dissolution
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The Peoples Democratic Party in Oyo State has hailed the ruling of a state High Court, sitting in Ibadan, which granted a stay of execution of an earlier judgment preventing Governor Seyi Makinde from removing local government chairmen and councillors.

The governor had on his inauguration day sacked all elected chairmen and councillors across 33 councils and 35 Local Council Development Areas.

The sacked officials had prior to the inauguration secured an order by Justice Aderonke Aderemi barring the governor, the House of Assembly or any of its agents from dissolving the executives of the local governments and local council development areas in the state.

Through their group, Association of Local Government of Nigeria, they subsequently stormed the court after their sacking and sought to enforce the May 6 judgment on the grounds that the new administration in the state had dismissed council chairmen in contravention of the earlier judgment.

They also alleged that Makinde was planning to appoint caretaker chairmen for the local governments and local council development areas.

But Justice Ladiran Akintola of the Oyo State High Court, on Tuesday granted the order for “stay of execution” of the earlier judgment.

Reacting to the judgment, the state PDP Publicity Secretary, Akeem Olatunji, said the ruling was in clear adherence to the dictates of the rule of law.

He said, “We commend the judiciary for living up to its appellation as the real last hope of the oppressed.

“We equally urge the Government of Oyo State to swing into action by taking necessary steps to reposition the local government system in the state.”
