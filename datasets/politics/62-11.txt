Zamfara committed to tackling insecurity – SGF
Maiharaji Altine, Gusau

The Secretary to Government of Zamfara State, Alhaji Bala Maru, has said security and welfare remained the priority of the current administration in the state.

Maru stated this while briefing journalists on the activities organised to celebrate Governor Bello Matawalle’s 100 days in office.

Maru said the state government had decided to prioritise security and welfare of the citizenry considering the level of insecurity and poverty that had crippled the economy of the state.

The SSG said when Matawalle took over the affairs of the state a few months ago, what he inherited were insecurity and abject poverty, hence, his priority was to tackle the challenges.

He said, “Without welfare and security, you will find an unwilling society as well as unwilling civil servants.

“We are bringing, new concept of 100 days in office for the achievements we recorded in security and welfare because what we believe is that you celebrate your achievement based on the problems of your people. Our problems here are insecurity and poverty.”
