Only people with degree in stupidity will leave PDP for APC —Melaye
Success Nwogu, Abuja

The Senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Dino Melaye, on Monday said it was untrue that he was planning to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress.

Melaye, on his official twitter handle @dino-melaye, stated that APC will be defeated in Kogi State, adding that only compound fools and people with degree in stupidity will leave PDP for APC.

He wrote: “Only compound fools and people with degree in stupidity will leave PDP for APC. APC will be defeated in Kogi State.”

Dino was one of the aspirants that contested during the PDP September 3 governorship primary for Kogi State.

He scored 70 votes to come fourth, while Musa Wada was declared winner with 748 votes, having defeated Abubakar Ibrahim, who came second with 710; and a former Kogi Governor, Wada Idris, who came third with 345 votes.

Dino appealed against the result to the PDP Kogi and Bayelsa Governorship Appeal Panel headed by the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, but his appeal did not succeed.

He also rejected the party’s appointment as the Director-General of the Kogi State PDP Governorship Campaign Council.

His tweet last Friday rejecting the offer sparked speculations that the senator might dump the PDP.

He had tweeted, “Let me state categorically that I have turned down the position of the Director-General of the Kogi State Governorship Campaign Council.

“I wish PDP all the best.

“When truth is a casualty, there is chaos.”
