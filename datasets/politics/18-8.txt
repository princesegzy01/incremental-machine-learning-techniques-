Sola Shittu Benin

The legislative arm of the Owan West Local Government Area in Edo State, has suspended two councillors for breaching “certain aspects of the legislative rules and proceedings.”

The House denied that the two councillors were suspended because they were not in support of Obaseki’s second term.

The councillors, Samuel Ohimai of Ward Three and Kelvin Omo Esemuze of Ward Six, were suspended indefinitely without pay at Tuesday’s plenary.

The motion for their suspension was moved by the Chief Whip, Monday Ifidon.

Leader of the House, Augustine Ohiolere, said, “The councillors breached Order 4 Rules 2 and 3 of the local government laws, not because they were not in support of Governor Godwin Obaseki’s second term.”

Meanwhile, leaders of the All Progressives Congress in the Owan West LGA on Tuesday threw their weight behind the second term ambition of Obaseki.

Speaking at a joint press briefing in Benin City, the Special Adviser to Governor Obaseki on Strategic Planning and Programme Management Office, Dr Uyi Oduwa-Malaka, called for cooperation from residents, saying Obaseki had delivered on “political reforms, blockage of financial leakages, war against hooliganism, institution of a new social order and human capital development.”
