Bayelsa APC inaugurates ‘Team Ogunboss’ for gov poll
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The All Progressives Congress in Bayelsa State has inaugurated the Team Ogunboss campaign office to galvanise support for the electoral victory of the party’s candidate, Mr Lyon David, and his running mate, Mr. Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, for the November 16 governorship election.

‘General’ Ogunboss, whose real name is Mr Eris Paul, is a former militant commander who operated a camp in the creeks of the state and hails from the same Southern Ijaw LGA as Lyon.

The state APC chairman, Mr Jothan Amos, who conducted the inauguration in Yenagoa, said the time had come for the party to take over Bayelsa and end the alleged impunity of the Governor Seriake Dickson-led administration and the Peoples Democratic Party.

He said it was only the APC that could bring about the desired change the people of the state were clamouring for.

Amos commended Paul for proposing the Team Ogunboss campaign group for the APC and urged them to go to all the nooks and crannies of the state to canvass votes for the candidates and the party.

He said, “If the APC is voted into power, the tears of civil servants will be wiped off. Our party will bring about financial empowerment for the youths and women, and improve on the educational and the health sectors of the state.”

In his remarks, the state coordinator, Team Ogunboss, Mr Marvin Olotu, said the ticket of Lyon and Degi-Eremienyo was capable of engendering the needed change in the state.

One of the highlights of the event was the inauguration of the coordinators of the Team Ogunboss for the eight local government areas and constituencies.
