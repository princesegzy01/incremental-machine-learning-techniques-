Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto

The National and State Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Sokoto, on Thursday, upheld the election of the leader, Sokoto State House of Assembly, representing Illela Constituency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, Bello Ambarura.

The tribunal dismissed the petition filed by the defeated candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dayyabu Kalmalo, which challengeed the declaration of Ambarura as the winner of the March 9 election conducted by the third respondent, the Independent National Electoral Commission.

Kalmalo had alleged, among others, that the house leader was not duly elected, saying he had not scored the majority of the lawful votes cast.

He had also alleged that there was substantial noncompliance with the nation’s electoral laws, which had affected the outcome of the poll.

Kalmalo had also, among others, prayed the tribunal to withdraw the Certificate of Return issued to Ambarura, and declare him the winner or alternatively, order fresh elections in the polling units where results were cancelled.

However, in his judgment, Justice I. Iwodi dismissed the petition for want of merit with no costs awarded, saying the petitioners had failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt and they only presented hearsay evidences.

He further held that the first respondent, Ambarura, was duly elected as he had scored the majority of the lawful votes cast.

In the same vein, Justice Iwodi submitted that the election of the house leader was valid and there was no need for an order of the tribunal to INEC to conduct rerun elections.
