Success Nwogu, Abuja

Two Kogi State governorship aspirants, Abubakar Ibrahim and Senator Dino Melaye have appealed the result of the Kogi State PDP

governorship primary.

Chairman, PDP Kogi State Governorship Primary, Ahmadu Fintri, had declared Musa Wada who polled 748 votes as the winner of the primary.

Ibrahim came second with 710 votes, while Melaye came fourth, having scored 70 votes behind Idris Wada who came third with 345 votes.

Sources informed our Correspondent on Thursday that Ibrahim and

Melaye petitioned the party’s Appeal Committee for Bayelsa and Kogi states’ primaries headed by the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus.

Though no official statement was made on the outcome of the appeal

when the appeal panel members left the PDP Secretariat at Wadata, Wuse, in Abuja, our Correspondent gathered that the panel, comprising members of the PDP National Working Committee, looked into the issues raised by the aggrieved aspirants.

The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, confirmed that Secondus headed the appeal panel.
