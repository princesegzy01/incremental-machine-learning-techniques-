God asks me to challenge Akeredolu again — Jegede
Peter Dada, Akure

The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the November 26, 2016 governorship election in Ondo State, Mr Eyitayo Jegede, has declared his intention to contest the election again next year.

Jegede, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, lost the election to the incumbent governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, of the All Progressives Congress.

Addressing party leaders from the Akure South Local Government Area at a meeting held at the state PDP secretariat on Tuesday, Jegede said he had consulted God, who had given him the go-ahead to contest the election.

He said, “I am here to thank you for the support you gave me during the 2016 governorship election. I see myself as somebody who is ready to serve.

“I contested the last election and we knew the result, the following day we went to church to thank God for how far He had helped us. Now, I consulted God Almighty again, I asked if I should go ahead with this project and He told me to go ahead.
