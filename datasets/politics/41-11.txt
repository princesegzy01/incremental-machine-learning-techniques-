‘Don’t register new parties’
Tunde Oyekola

Kwara State Chairman of the Abundant Nigeria Renewal Party, Mr Ade Alabi, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission not to register new parties.

He asked INEC to reduce the number of the existing parties.

Alibi told our correspondent in Ilorin on Saturday that most of the parties that participated in the last general elections lacked political ideologies.

Alabi said, “It is not necessary to have more parties, because many of those that contested the last elections did not have geographical spread.” According to him, some politicians only used such parties for negotiations with the bigger parties.

He said, “There are many that have no presence in some states and they also have no offices in the state capitals.”

“It is a pity that many of the political players are commercialising the system and are using the parties to negotiate for money, this tells you that they lack political ideologies.”
