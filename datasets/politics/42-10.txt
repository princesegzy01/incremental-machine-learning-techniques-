Ade Adesomoju, Abuja

The Taraba State Governorship Election Tribunal on Friday affirmed the re-election of Governor Darius Ishaku of the Peoples Democratic Party in the March 9, 2019 governorship poll in the state.

A three-man panel led by Justice M.O. Adewara unanimously dismissed the petition by Abubakar Danladi of the All Progressive Party challenging the outcome of the poll.

The tribunal held that the petitioners failed to prove their claims that the election was marred by irregularities and substantial non-compliance with the Electoral Act.

In the lead judgment, Justice Adewara, who read the lead judgment, held that Danladi was not qualified to contest the 2019 election.

The tribunal held that a Federal High Court in Taraba State had given a judgment on March 6, 2019, in a suit marked FHC/JAL/CS/01/2019, disqualifying Danladi from contesting the election.

He noted that the affirmation of the judgment by the Supreme Court implied that the APC had no valid candidate in the election.

He noted that the APC did not participate in the election and was not, therefore not qualified and had no right to present a petition before the tribunal.

The tribunal added that even when the substance of the petition is considered, it lacks in merit.

It added that the petitioners failed to lead sufficient evidence to establish the claims in their petition that the governor and his party, the PDP, failed to poll the majority of lawful votes.
