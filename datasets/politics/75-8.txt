The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested a lawyer, Mr Uyiekpen Giwa-Osagie, and his son, Erhunse, for allegedly laundering $2m in the build-up to this year’s general elections.

Giwa-Osagie, who is said to be the lawyer to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, was alleged to have handled the $2m cash without going through a financial institution.

The EFCC acting spokesman, Tony Orilade, confirmed the arrest of Atiku’s lawyer and his son, adding that they would be arraigned next week.

“Yes, they are with us preparatory to their arraignment. Their charges have been served on them and they will be arraigned in court for money laundering-related offences,” he added.

Already, the EFCC has filed a three-count charge against the suspects before the Federal High Court in Lagos.

In a copy of the charge sheet sighted by one of our correspondents on Friday, the EFCC alleged that the Giwa-Osagies conspired between each other to make cash payment of $2m on February 12, 2019 without going through a financial institution.

EFCC lawyer, Mr Rotimi Oyedepo, who signed the charge sheet, said the amount exceeded the threshold stipulated by the anti-money laundering law.

Oyedepo said the Giwa-Osagies acted contrary to Sections 18(a) and 1(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011 and were liable to be punished under Section 16(2) (b) of the same Act.
