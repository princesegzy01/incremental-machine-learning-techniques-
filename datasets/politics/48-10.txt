Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Independent National Electoral Commission, on Thursday, organised the Election Monitoring and Support Centre Implementers Workshop in Bayelsa State as part of preparations for the conduct of the November 16 governorship election in the state.

The training, which held in Yenagoa under the aegis of the European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria programme, was attended by electoral officers, assistant electoral officers, heads of units and election monitoring parties of the INEC, and the European Centre for Electoral Support, among others.

Also, the Electoral Institute of INEC carried out a separate training on election security for the Bayelsa State governorship election for security personnel.

The Chief Technical Adviser to the National Chairman, INEC, Prof Bolade Ayinla, described the EMSC as the new tool for the management of elections by the commission.

Ayinla, who noted that electoral officers and assistant electoral officers were valuable field assets in the conduct of elections, urged them to always work together for the success of the commission.

He said the EMSC followed the integration of the three platforms of the Election Management System, the Election Operating Support Centre and the Election Risk Management, which INEC used to operate previously.
