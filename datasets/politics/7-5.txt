“I have taken time to reflect on what was the modus operandi in the past and I can say to you clearly that the state used to be supplied with medications that were just about to expire; that era should be over for good in Oyo State.”

Abass, maintained that the Makinde administration’s focus on the health sector had seen it pay particular attention to HIV/AIDS response by ensuring that people had access to relevant information, HIV testing services and access to treatment, care and support for people living with the virus.
