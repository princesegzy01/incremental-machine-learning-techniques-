Assembly crisis: Bauchi gov wants monarchsâ€™ intervention
Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi

Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has appealed to traditional rulers in the state to intervene in the leadership crisis in the House of Assembly.

The crisis started when elected members held a parallel inauguration, leading to the emergence of two Speakers.

Abubakar Suleiman was elected by 13 members as Speaker during the inauguration presided over by the Clerk in the Assembly, while 18 members elected Kawuwa Damina as Speaker outside the Assembly complex.

The All Progressives Congress has 22 members in the 31-member Assembly while the Peoples Democratic Party has eight and the New Nigeria Peoples Party one.
