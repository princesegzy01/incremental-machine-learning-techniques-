Fresh controversy trails appointment of Plateau LG committees
James Abraham, Jos

The appointment of management committee chairmen in four council areas of Plateau State by Governor Simon Lalong was greeted with a fresh controversy on Tuesday.

Lalong had appointed the All Progressives Congress candidates who won their primaries preparatory to the botched October 2018 council poll to run the affairs in the affected four council areas of Jos North, Jos South, Riyom and Barkin Ladi.

Last week, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party described the action of the governor as illegal.

Also, a forum of PDP candidates and councillors equally rejected the appointment of the interim committees, calling for a fresh election in the four council areas.

The controversy over the appointment of the management committees continued on Tuesday with a group under the aegis of Autochthonous People of Jos North, calling on the governor to reverse the appointment or be ready to contend with the people.

Leaders of the group, including Mrs Theresa Kaze, Jonathan Nyako, Daniel Garuba and Da Chollom Gyang, at a press conference in Jos, accused the governor of imposing a non-indigene of Hausa origin on the people as the chairman of the Jos North LGA to pave the way for their age-old quest for an emir of Jos.

The group said, â€œWe observe that the imposition of the APC candidates as new management committee members for Jos North, Jos South, Barkin Ladi and Riyom is coming a few months after Governor Lalong tested the waters under the guise of traditional council reforms.
