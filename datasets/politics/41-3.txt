Ex-govts massive fraud caused Kogi irregular salary – Adeyemi
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The Director-General of the Governor Yahaya Bello Campaign Organisation, Senator Smart Adeyemi, has attributed the irregular payment of salaries in the state to endemic corruption of the past administration.

Adeyemi stated this in an interview with journalists after the defection of a former chairman of Kabba/Bunu Local Government Area of the state, who was also a member of the state House of Assembly, Dr Nathaniel Ojo-Taiwo.

Ojo-Taiwo led 500 of his supporters from the Peoples Democratic Party to the ruling All Progressive Congress in the state.

Adeyemi explained that Bello inherited a backlog of salaries not paid by the previous PDP administration and that the current governor had since battled successfully to put the situation right.

He explained that only the late governor Abubakar Audu was close to Bello in terms of achivements among all past governors of the state.

He said, “We all know that the primary duty of every government is to secure the lives and property of the people and Bello realised this and took steps to address it. That is why we are living in peace in the state.”

The Speaker, Kogi House of Assembly, Mathew Kolawole, said it would be difficult for anyone to surpass the achievements of Bello who, according to him, had made his mark in the politics of the state.
