Bayelsa 23rd anniversary
The Bayelsa State Government on Monday felicitated with residents on the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of the state, saying it had been a journey with mixed trajectory.

The Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Daniel Iworiso-Markson, thanked the founding fathers of Bayelsa for insisting on the creation of a state for homogenous Ijaw people.

He said despite some teething problems and challenges the state had experienced real development, especially in the last seven and half years of the current administration of Governor Seriake Dickson.
