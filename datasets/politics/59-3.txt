Leave Dickson alone, Bayelsa govt tells APC
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Bayelsa State Government has advised members and leaders of the All Progressives Congress in the state to leave Governor Seriake Dickson out of the internal problems of the APC.

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Media Relations, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, in a statement, said Dickson was “too focused to be distracted by a failed attempt to drag his name into the internal problems of the opposition APC in the state.”

Soriwei added that the governor’s major focus was to produce a credible candidate that would defeat any candidate presented by the APC in the November 16, 2019 governorship contest in the state.

He said it was common knowledge that Dickson had worked hard to “decimate” the APC in Bayelsa and was getting ready to defeat the party at the polls as usual.

DIckson’s spokesman stated that the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, who would run on the governor’s record of peace and stability, would retain the PDP’s control in Bayelsa “with a resounding victory.”

Soriwei also noted that the PDP, which had been in control in Bayelsa since 1999, did not need any secret deal with the APC to defeat the opposition party.

He said, “There is no such deal, contrary to the mischievous rumour about purported meetings.”
