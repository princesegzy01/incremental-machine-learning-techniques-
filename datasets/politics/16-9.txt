Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

Markson Fefegha on Thursday withdrew his resignation as Bayelsa State Commissioner for Mineral Resources, saying he had decided to return to the Seriake Dickson government and the Peoples Democratic Party.

Fefegha resigned his appointment and also announced he had quit the PDP on October 18.

It was learnt that Fefegha decided to reconsider his decision after much pressure on him by “several persons.”

Fefegha, who confirmed the development in a letter on Thursday announcing his return, said he resigned due to a breakdown in communication between him and the governor.

He urged all his supporters to work for the victory for the PDP in the November 16 governorship election.

The letter read, “It is with a deep sense of responsibility that I address my colleagues, political associates and supporters through this medium.

“You will recall that I resigned my appointment as Commissioner for Mineral Resources on October 18, 2019 because of what I perceived as ‘political uncertainty’ and other considerations.

“This was due largely to the communication gap between me and the Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, at the time. Having met and discussed with him, I have reconsidered my decision to remain in the party and the government.”

Dickson in a statement was quoted to have said that the PDP members who defected to the APC were outsiders to the PDP in the state..
