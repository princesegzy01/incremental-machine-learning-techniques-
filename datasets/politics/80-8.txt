Nominate commissioner-nominees, APC directs Osun members
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The All Progressives Congress in Osun State has directed members of the party across the nine federal constituencies in the state to nominate one candidate each for appointment as commissioner in Governor Adegboyega Oyetola’s cabinet.

Whoever would be nominated, the party said, must possess a minimum educational qualification of first degree in any discipline.

The state chairman, Prince Gboyega Famoodun, disclosed this on Friday in a statement signed by his media aide, Mr. Kola Olabisi, after meeting with party leaders in Osogbo.

The statement read, “The governor is ready to constitute his cabinet with the active involvement of the party in accordance with the supremacy of the party.

“The least required educational qualification for making the cabinet list is first degree, according to the government.”

The APC chairman, who enjoined leaders of the party to compile names of the candidates without rancour, gave Wednesday as the deadline for nomination of candidates.
