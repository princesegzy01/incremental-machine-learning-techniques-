Cross River APC gov candidate makes a U-turn on appeal
Ada Wodu, Calabar

The All Progressives Congress governorship candidate in Cross River State in the March 9 governorship election, Senator John Owan-Enoh, has decided not to file an appeal against the judgment of the Election Petition Tribunal, which dismissed his petition and upheld the victory of Governor Ben Ayade of the Peoples Democratic Party.

The state Chairman of the APC, Sir John Ochala, in a statement on Wednesday, said, “Senator John Owan Enoh, the APC governorship candidate for the March 9, 2019 Cross River State Governorship Election, has dropped his intention to file an appeal against Governor Benedict Ayade and the PDP.”

Ochala also said other candidates of the party, who were not satisfied with the judgment of the tribunal, were going ahead with their appeal.

The APC chairman said, “In fact, I can confirm to you that the senatorial candidate of the party for the Northern Senatorial District seat in the state, Wabilly Nyiam, has filed his appeal against the tribunal judgment.”

Asked why Owan-Enoh backtracked, Ochala said, “We cannot blame him. It may not be unconnected with a lack of institutional support.

“For instance, you will need unflinching support from the national secretariat of the party going forward, so if you don’t get good indications, you take a personal decision.”

The governor’s Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Mr Christian Ita, reacted said, it was a welcome development and that it was good for the growth and the overall wellbeing of the state.
