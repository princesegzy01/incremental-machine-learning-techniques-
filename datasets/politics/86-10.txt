Reps pardon Rivers member over mace-snatching incident
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The House of Representatives has pardoned a member from Rivers State, Mr Gogo Bright, who snatched the mace at the plenary on July 3, 2019.

Bright had removed the mace from its rightful position in protest against the emergence of minority leaders of the House.

The House had set up an ad hoc committee to investigate the matter and make recommendations.

At the plenary on Thursday, the report by the panel was considered, which recommended that Bright be suspended for 30 legislative days notwithstanding his apology to the committee and withdrawal of court case he filed against the House.

The panel stated that the lawmaker’s action breached the Code of Conduct of the House.

Bright, however, pleaded with the House to temper justice with mercy, saying that it was a mistake.

The Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, urged the lawmakers to accept Bright’s apology and rescind their decision to probe into the matter while the report should be stood down.

Gbajabiamila’s plea was unanimously accepted, while the Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, hailed the Speaker for his leadership style.
