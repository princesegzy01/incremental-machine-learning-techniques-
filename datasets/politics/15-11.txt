I never knew my opponent till days to election —Wike
Chukwudi Akasike

Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said that he never knew the candidate of the African Action Congress, Biokpomabo Awara, until a few days to the governorship election in March 2019.

Wike also stated that he never doubted that the Supreme Court would confirm his reelection since Awara couldn’t have won an election he (Awara) didn’t contest.

The governor said from the beginning, the AAC candidate never posed any problem to him because he (Awara) was unknown to Rivers people.

Wike who spoke in Port Harcourt on Saturday said he only got to know of Awara about two days to the election.

He said, “I expected the confirmation because the law is clear. The man who is challenging me never contested any election; so, he couldn’t have won. It is so painful, but what do you do?

“It is part of life; if he really ran in the election with me, one can say there could be a problem. A man that I never knew till a few days to the election; how would it have been that the man won the election? So, I expected that the court would do the right thing, which they did.”
