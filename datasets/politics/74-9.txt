Mbaise professionals hosts Ihedioha
A group of professionals under aegis of Mbaise People’s Congress says its annual colloquium will hold soon with Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State in attendance.

In a statement issued in Lagos on Sunday by Publicity Secretary of the association, Mr Chimaroke Nnaji, the group said that the colloquium would discuss funding of a proposed community university.

Nnaji said, “The annual discussion roundtable – Mbaise Colloquium – organised by Mbaise People’s Congress since 1995 will hold on Wednesday.

“The purpose of this annual intellectual harvest is to discuss issues of relevance to the people of Mbaise both at home and in the diaspora.

“With the theme, ‘Funding De Mbaise University: Opportunities and Options,’ the flagship programme will attract top intellectuals, professionals and technocrats of Mbaise extraction and beyond.”

He added that three secondary school pupils from Mbaise who outperformed others in the recently released Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination would be honoured at the colloquium.
