‘Bayelsa Central must produce Dickson’s successor’
Simon Utebor

Political leaders and stakeholders, under the auspices of the Progressives of the Bayelsa Central Senatorial District, have insisted that it is the turn of the zone to produce the next governor of Bayelsa State after the tenure of Governor Seriake Dickson.

The governorship poll in the state is slated for November 16, 2019 and Governor Dickson will hand over to the next administration on February 14, 2020.

In a statement on Friday, the group, led by a former Bayelsa Commissioner for Works and ex-Secretary of the Ijaw National Congress, Mr Charles Ambaowei, called on the political parties in the state to adhere to the existing principle of zoning.

He said the zoning system had produced past governors such as Chief Diepreye Alameiseigha (Bayelsa Central); Dr. Goodluck Jonathan (Bayelsa East); Chief Timipre Sylva (Bayelsa East); and Governor Seriake Dickson (Bayelsa West).

Ambaowei said Bayelsa had since 1996 operated the principle of rotation as allegedly handed down to the state by the founding fathers.

He said, “They established the principle to zone governorship to the three senatorial districts. From inception of democracy, it has been practised from one senatorial district to another.

“What is agitating us is that the principle is about being jettisoned by self-seeking politicians.

He also called on politicians from the Bayelsa East and Bayelsa West senatorial districts to show solidarity and key into their agitations.

Also speaking, a former member of the State House of Assembly, Mr Emela Gentle, called on the leadership of the PDP to adhere to the issue of rotation in order to ensure equity and fairness.
