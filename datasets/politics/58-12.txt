Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

Orlu Elders Council has asked the Governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, to prosecute his predecessor, Rochas Okorocha.

The Chairman, Francis Dike, SAN, who led a delegation to the state deputy governor, Gerald Irona, accused Okorocha of looting the state.

Dike commended the State House of Assembly and the Attorney General of the state for taking steps towards adopting the Administration of Criminal Justice Act in the state.

The elders urged the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the 2019 elections, Senator Hope Uzodimma, to end his litigation against the governor in the interest of the state.

Dike said, “ Everything was done at shameless quotation of money by Okorocha and his family members. This government should be ready for probe when it leaves and that is why we ask for probe, prosecution of Okorocha and his running dogs.”

The deputy governor commended the elders for speaking out on issues concerning the state.

In a related development, there was panic at the Owerri residence of Okorocha, as boys loyal to the former governor clashed with the committee on recovery of stolen government committee.

The chairman of the recovery team, Jasper Ndubuaku, said thugs loyal to Okorocha attacked him when he led his team to recover properties belonging to the state government.

But Okorocha who responded through his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, said Ndubuaku invaded his residence with 700 thugs.
