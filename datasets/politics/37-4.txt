Umahi threatens to sack aide who abuses Buhari
Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki

Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, on Thursday, said he would sack any of his aides who insulted President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress.

Umahi also warned that any of his appointees who hitherto “derived pleasure” in talking down his fellow governors across the country and their achievements should desist from doing so or have their appointment terminated.

The governor, in the build-up to the 2019 general elections, had described Buhari as his friend, despite their political differences.

Umahi, in a statement by his Special Assistant on New Media, Mr Francis Nwaze, which was made available to The PUNCH, said anybody who wished to “throw unnecessary stones at any of the leaders should be ready to leave his government.”

It read, “The Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, has prohibited any of his political appointees from castigating or abusing the Nigerian President, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari.

“Doing such to any government or any governor in this country has no value to add to his administration.

“Henceforth, any posting against the President, any governor or government from any of his appointees will attract immediate termination of appointment by him.”
