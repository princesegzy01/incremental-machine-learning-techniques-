PAC faults Reps over de-registration debate
…says discourse should be on constitutional amendment, others

Friday Olokor, Abuja

The Inter-Party Advisory Council, on Wednesday, faulted the move by the House of Representatives to investigate the failure of the Independent National Electoral Commission to de-register political parties, describing it as undemocratic.

The move, according to IPAC, contravened any known constitutional democracy “and should stop as the case was before a court of competent jurisdiction.”

The National Publicity Secretary of IPAC, Ademola Babatunde, in a statement, called on the Green Chamber to preoccupy itself with amendment of the Electoral Act and addressing the flaws in the nation’s electoral system and not the number of political parties in Nigeria.

Babatunde said the Electoral Act should be the major point of discourse in order to plan effectively for the years ahead.

IPAC, a coalition of 91 political parties in Nigeria, said the National Assembly should see Nigeria as being in a condition that needed drastic attention in all aspects.

The statement said, “The purported decision is undemocratic and runs foul of any known constitutional democracy and, therefore, such a move should be immediately stopped, particularly when the matter is before a court of competent jurisdiction in Nigeria.

“The National Assembly should, as a matter of loyalty to our laws and the Nigerians whom it represents, be passionately concerned about the very obvious systemic errors in our institutions, challenges combating our security system and structures that make life unbearable for the average Nigerian.”
