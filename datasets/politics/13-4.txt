Supreme Court delivers first ruling against Atiku, PDP
Ade Adesomoju, Abuja

The Supreme Court on Wednesday delivered its first ruling against the Peoples Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.

Atiku and his party are before the apex court to challenge the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari at the February 23, 2019 poll.

The Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, who leads the seven-man panel of the apex court, in the lead ruling consented to by other members, overruled Atiku and his partyâ€™s request that their seven interlocutory appeals should be heard after the main one must have been argued.

The seven-man panel held that it would be unnecessary to hear the interlocutory appeals when a judgment on the main appeal marked SC.1211/2019 would cover the field.
