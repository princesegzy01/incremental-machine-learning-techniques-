‘Homegrown politician must succeed Obiano’
Tony Okafor, Awka

A political group, Greater Anambra Forum, has said a home-grown politician must succeed the incumbent governor, Willie Obiano in 2022.

The forum, which was founded in 1998, said it would no longer tolerate diaspora politicians as leaders of the state.

According to the Coordinator of the group, Mr Fabian Ozoigbo, anyone to be considered as the next governor of the state must be a grass-roots politician who had understudied the politics of the state.

The group stated this after its consultative meetings with the people of the three senatorial districts of the state.

Ozoigbo added, “Another important criterion is that the next governor must come from the southern senatorial district of the state in fulfilment of an unwritten zoning pact, which has existed in the state.”
