Deliver good governance, Secondus tells Buhari, govs, others
Success Nwogu, Abuja

The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, on Tuesday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari, the 36 governors, members of the National Assembly and other public officials to remember that power is transient and so deliver good governance to the people.

Secondus also urged them to guide their actions towards the people as they would not last eternally in office.

He spoke when PDP leaders paid a condolence visit to the Governor of Adamawa, Ahmadu Fintiri, according to a statement from the PDP National Publicity Secretary’s Office.

He urged public officials to emulate Fintiri’s stewardship, according to him, in delivering good governance and development to the people of Adamawa State.

Secondus said, “You (Fintiri) represent peace which the air around Adamawa has shown. Your wish was to see your father live longer and see your achievements in office but God has called him to come to a place of peace. There is a time for everything. Those in government should know that their tenure will come to an end one day.

“You were elected on the basis of your performance while in office. This is a demonstration of the legacies you got from your father. The steps taken so far, including appointments, show that you are a man of faith who lives by his words.

“We pray that God’s wisdom will continue to direct you in your determination to render service to your people and our nation at large.”

Fintiri, in his response, said he would leave no stone unturned in repositioning the state for greater productivity for the benefit of the people, in line with the manifesto of the PDP.
