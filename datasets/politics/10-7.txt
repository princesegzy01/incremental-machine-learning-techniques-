James Abraham, Jos

The Jos Division of the Court of Appeal has fixed November 4, 2019 to hear a petition challenging the victory of Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State during the last general election.

The petition was filed by the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Jeremiah Useni and his party with the Independent National Electoral Commission and the All Progressives Congress as the first and third respondents respectively.

Useni’s media consultant, Mr Yiljap Abraham, confirmed the development to our correspondent in Jos on Saturday.

He said “The appeal filed by the governorship candidate of the PDP, Senator Jeremiah Useni and his party over the Plateau State governorship election has been fixed for November 4, 2019 for hearing. We are in receipt of the notice by the Jos Division of the Court of Appeal for hearing on the matter and we are hopeful that the Senator and his party will get justice when judgement is delivered.”

The governorship election petition sitting in Jos had in October dismissed the petition of Useni and the PDP over the matter and ruled that Lalong was validly elected during the last general elections
