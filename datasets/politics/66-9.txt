We won’t allow law breakdown, disorder in state assemblies – Gbajabiamila
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has stated that the National Assembly will not sit and watch any breakdown of law and order in any House of Assembly across the states of the federation.

Gbajabiamila, who was represented by the Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, stated this at a roundtable with the Conference of Speakers of State Houses of Assembly on Tuesday in Lagos.

The Speaker recalled that the National Assembly, being the apex legislative institution of the country, made positive interventions that saw to the amicable resolution of the challenges recently faced by the legislatures in Bauchi and Edo states.

According to him, such interventions by the National Assembly are necessary to safeguard the legislative institutions.

He said, “For the avoidance of any doubts, the National Assembly is the head of the legislature in Nigeria. Events of recent weeks in some parts of the country tended to go in the wrong direction, but we are glad that the intervention by the National Assembly has brought wisdom to play, particularly in Bauchi and Edo states.”

“I want to assure you that the National Assembly would not allow any breakdown of law and order in any state assembly, let alone to contemplate any vacuum.”

Gbajabiamila also urged the speakers to be cautious in the discharge of their duties, with a view to ensuring the sanctity of the legislature as an institution.

“My distinguished speakers, I must point out here that there is a need for caution. The caution lies in our collective efforts to ensure that the work of lawmakers, be it at the state or national level, does not suffer any infringement.

“We must not only be seen to be working, but work in a way that our work would speak for us. Of particular note is the need to point out the sanctity of the National Assembly which must be recognised.”
