We didn’t endorse Yahaya Bello, says KOWA
Friday Olokor, Abuja

KOWA Party has dissociated itself from reports in which it was listed among political parties endorsing Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State in the governorship election scheduled for November 16.

The party said those who carried out the purported endorsement did not obtain clearance from its national leadership.

“Whatever happened was an individual’s action or a few individuals at the state level without the official approval of the party’s national leadership and, to that extent, it’s of no value,” KP stated.

The acting National Chairman of KOWA Party, Mark Adebayo, in a statement on Thursday, said it had commenced investigation of the circumstances that led to the alleged endorsement, adding that “appropriate disciplinary measures shall be applied on whoever is culpable.”
