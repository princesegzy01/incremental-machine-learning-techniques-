PDP vows to regain Anambra in 2021
Raphael Ede, Enugu

The Peoples Democratic Party has said it will retake Anambra State in the 2021 governorship election.

The party said it would go for the best candidate as part of the strategy irrespective of the zone such a person might come from.

The National Vice Chairman of the party, South-East zone, Chief Austin Umahi, stated this on Friday while fielding questions from journalists at the end of the party’s zonal working committee meeting in Enugu.

Umahi said that recapturing Anambra State was a task that the party must accomplish, saying that it was regrettable that South East governors would be meeting on matters of great concerns to the Igbo and that Anambra would be presented.

He explained that the suspension of the zoning system would only be applied to the coming Anambra governorship election, explaining that having been out of power, the party needed to field the best candidate that would win the election.

“The zone has been mandated to go and recapture Anambra State the way we did in Imo State and kudos to the zone because we are determined and we were not dragged down, we said Imo State, it’s time for you, enough of “Akpuola gi” (molded image) and we actualised it.
