Our coalition with APC not threatened —Osun SDP
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

Osun State Chapter of the Social Democratic Party has said the coalition between it and the ruling All Progressives Congress has not been threatened.

SDP’s spokesperson in the state, Taiwo Akeju, in a chat with The PUNCH on Tuesday, said even with the declaration by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola that no opposition party member would be appointed into his cabinet, his party still believes “the spirit of a coalition between SDP and APC is still alive.”

He, however, said the party would not discuss further details of the coalition with the media.

Governor Oyetola had told newsmen on Monday that it would not appoint any opposition member into his cabinet.

He explained that bringing opposition members into the cabinet may cause a problem, as the government would work with the APC manifesto.

Akeju said, “Our coalition with APC is not threatened. We heard the statement credited to the governor and our reaction is that we are in still in coalition. We won’t discuss our matter on the pages of newspaper.”
