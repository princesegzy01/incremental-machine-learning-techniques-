Group protests alleged delay in Orji Kalu’s trial
Tobi Aworinde, Abuja

A non-governmental organisation, Network for the Advancement of Good Governance, has protested the delayed of in trial of former governor of Abia State, Senator Orji Kalu, by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on an alleged N7.6bn fraud.

The EFCC is prosecuting Kalu, along with a former state Commissioner for Finance, Udeh Udeogu, and his company, Slok Nigeria Limited, for the alleged fraud on an amended 39 counts.

They, however, all pleaded not guilty to the charges, which were filed against them 12 years ago.

The National Coordinator of the NAGG, Onyeka Igwe, who addressed journalists during a protest at the EFCC office in Wuse 2, Abuja, on Thursday, demanded the accelerated trial of Kalu, who represents Abia North in the Senate.

The group said the delay in the trial was not in the spirit of the anti-corruption crusade, which is the hallmark of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government.

Igwe added, “We demand clarifications from the EFCC and other relevant authorities on the present status of the former governor of Abia State and his alleged N7.6bn fraud trial.”
