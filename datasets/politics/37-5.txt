Politicians without other livelihoods will be corrupt —Akande
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The former interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Bisi Akande, on Thursday, said politicians with no other sources of livelihood may end up getting involved in corrupt acts in public office.

Akande, who spoke in Yoruba at the lecture organised to mark 94th birthday of Second Republic Senator, Pa Ayo Fasanmi, held in Osogbo, said many old-generation politicians had been successful in their careers before venturing into politics.

The APC chieftain noted that, before Fasanmi was elected as a senator, he had excelled as a pharmacist, adding that present-day politicians with no other source of income would be tempted to engage in graft.

“If you are not established in your profession and you get into politics, you will never do anything that is right.

“When we were still active in politics, we were contributing money for the party, but now, the reverse is the case. If politics can go back to the way it was being practised back then, we will have a sane society,” Akande said.

Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State, who was represented by his deputy, Benedict Alabi, in his remarks, described Fasanmi as a beacon of hope and an encouragement to the younger generation.
