Court orders Kogi APC to suspend indirect primary
Ade Adesomoju, Abuja

A Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday ordered the All Progressives Congress to suspend the plan to use indirect primary for the nomination of its candidate in the November 16, 2019 governorship election in Kogi State.

Ruling on an ex parte application filed by four members of the factional executive committee of the party in the state, Justice Taiwo Taiwo ordered parties to the suit “to maintain the status quo” pending the main suit which dwells on the propriety of adopting indirect mode of primary.

Justice Taiwo ordered an accelerated hearing in the suit and adjourned till July 19 to enable him to dispense with the suit ahead of the party’s primary scheduled for August 29.

He also ordered the plaintiffs to serve the papers filed in the suit on the defendant, who must also file all necessary responses before the next hearing date.

The plaintiffs, Destiny Aromeh; Isah Abubakar; Noah Aku and Joy Onu, were said to be of the Haddy Ametuo-led executive committee of the party in the state.

They have as their rival the other faction of the party loyal to Governor Yahaya Bello.

The APC is the sole respondent to the suit.

The party was, however, not represented at the Thursday’s ex parte hearing, a one-sided hearing, in which only the applicants’ side was heard.
