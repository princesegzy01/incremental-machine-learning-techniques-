The Operation Lafiya Dole Theatre Command of the Nigerian Army, Maiduguri, Borno State, on Sunday said it had begun an exercise, Operation Positive Identification, in the North-East to fish out the Boko Haram and Islamic State West African Province fighters who are hiding in some communities of Borno and Yobe states.

The army stated that residents and members of the public in the North-East were enjoined to carry a valid means of identification in the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe.

The theatre command’s spokesman, Col. Ado Isa, in a statement on Sunday, said the troops had been instructed to conduct searches and check for valid means of identification from the members of the public in the region.

He listed the identification means to include the National Identification Card, Voter Registration Card, Driving licence and passports.

Isa said, “This has become necessary following credible information that some of the fleeing criminals are hibernating in some towns and villages of Borno and Yobe states in particular. Consequently, members of the public are enjoined to always carry valid means of identification when moving or passing through the states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe.”
