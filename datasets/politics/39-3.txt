Partisan politics causing slow devt in Akwa Ibom – CLO
Patrick Odey, Uyo

The Chairman of the Civil Liberties Organisation in Akwa Ibom State, Franklyn Isong, has blamed the slow pace of development in the state on partisan politics.

Isong, in a statement on Wednesday, said the state had not achieved much at 32 because of the “do-or-die” attitude of its politicians.

He said, “It is of great concern and something to regret that Akwa Ibom State has not achieved so much in the past 32 years of its existence because of partisan politics and the do-or -die attitude of political actors.

“The machinery of government has already been slowed down in the last 180 days because of the tribunal matters and we observed that going on appeal will further impose more hardship on the people.”

He said the only way for the state to move forward was for its political actors to imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship above party sentiments.
