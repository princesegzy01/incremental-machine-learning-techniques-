Enugu NLC condemns IPOB attack on Ohanaeze leader
Raphael Ede, Enugu

The Enugu State Chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress, on Thursday condemned the incessant attacks on the President General of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief John Nwodo, by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra.

The Chairman of NLC in the state, Mr. Virginus Nwobodo, spoke when the leadership of the NLC paid a solidarity visit to Nwodo in his house.

Nwobodo said it was unfortunate that, rather than pour accolades on Nwodo whom he described as a solid and progressive leader whose type Ohanaeze Ndigbo had never had, IPOB was insulting such a revered leader.

He said, “NLC condemns unequivocally the venomous outburst, insults, boundless vituperative attacks on one of the great leaders of Igbo nation.”

He described Nwodo as an “erudite, courageous, eloquent and well respected son” of Igbo land, adding that those attacking him were “suffering from delusions of grandeur.”

He said, “Nwodo must have denied himself comfort and certain positions in the government of the country just to achieve justice and serve humanity,” the NLC boss added.

He, however, urged the IPOB to embrace peace that could lead to a referendum/restructuring and shun any act that could lead to another war.

In his response, Nwodo commended the NLC for its unflinching support, especially at the current critical period in the nation’s history.
