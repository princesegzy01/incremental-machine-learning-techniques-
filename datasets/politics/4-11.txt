Kogi gov election: UPC adopts APC’s Bello as candidate
The United Peoples’ Congress, one of the political parties participating in the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State, has adopted Governor Yahaya Bello of the All Progressives Congress as its candidate.

Kogi State chairman of the party, Mr. Moses Damisa, disclosed this during a news conference at the NUJ Press Centre on Friday in Lokoja.

Damisa said the adoption of Bello was due to similarities in ideologies and manifestos of both parties as well as their developmental objectives, adding that they also shared common development programmes.

He said the party had watched with keen interest, infrastructural development of the Bello-led APC administration in the state and its determination to do more.

The chairman lauded the governor’s programmes on youth and women empowerment as well as poverty alleviation, among other “people-oriented initiatives aimed at enhancing the well-being of the people.”

Damisa, therefore, enjoined UPC members to ensure victory for the APC by returning Bello to the Government House through their votes in the November 16 governorship election.

Earlier, the state secretary of the party, Suleiman Raji, had stressed that arrangements had been made by the party to ensure that its members across the state vote for Bello on November 16.
