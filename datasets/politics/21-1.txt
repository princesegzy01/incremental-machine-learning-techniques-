Kogi polls: I didn’t endorse Bello —PRP gov candidate
Mr Ayodele Ajibola, the Peoples Redemption Party candidate in the forthcoming governorship election in Kogi State has dissociated himself from the purported endorsement of Governor Yahaya Bello of the All Progressives Congress for a second term in office.

Ajibola made this known while speaking with newsmen on Saturday in Lokoja.

According to him, his party is prepared for the forthcoming election and will never be part of any endorsement.

The PRP candidate said he toiled to emerge as the candidate of one of the oldest political parties in Nigeria and would never trade his credibility for anything.

“We are prepared to go into the election with all seriousness and as such won’t sell ourselves and party to any party and candidate whatsoever for peanuts.

“Even if there is any agreement for endorsement with anyone in our party, it should be negotiated with the national officers of my party. The PRP at the national level has not in any way intimated me of any agreement with APC and their candidate.

“On this note, I dissociate myself and party from any endorsement of any candidate’’.

The News Agency of Nigeria recalls that a coalition of 45 political parties had at a news conference which held on Wednesday at the Nigeria Union of Journalists Press Centre adopted Bello as their sole candidate for the November 16 election.
