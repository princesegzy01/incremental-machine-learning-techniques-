Okoye said the action was in line with the ruling of a Federal High Court in Abuja.

The News Agency of Nigeria reported that Okoye told newsmen in Lokoja on Wednesday that INEC was “fully ready to go ahead with the election on Saturday.”

“All the electoral officials and ad hoc staff have been fully trained and ready to be deployed,” he added.
