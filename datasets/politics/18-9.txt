The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, has promised to lead a constitutional change that will give women better placement in the society.

He spoke on Tuesday in Lagos at the 19th National Women’s Conference of the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials.

Gbajabiamila said, “We have all heard about 30 per cent. The question is how do we empower women? I believe education is the first step to empowering women.

“There are constitutional impediments when we talk about 30 per cent. Our thought is that I will champion the amendment to those constitutional impediments.”

The Speaker said it was time the constitution was amended to accommodate whatever percentage was needed without discrimination against any sex.

The wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, who was represented at the event by the wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, said women needed to be empowered to contribute to nation building.

The Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, noted that the theme of the conference, ‘Unlearn, Learn and Relearn: 21st Century Women’s THEMES Perspectives and Approach,’ would impart knowledge to all the participants.

The Chairperson of COWLSO, Dr Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, said women must strategically position themselves to take full benefit of government programmes, adding that in the 21st century, women must embrace new ideas to be relevant.

Also at the event were the Governor of Kwara State, AbdulRahman AbdulRazak, and his Ogun State counterpart, Dapo Abiodun.
