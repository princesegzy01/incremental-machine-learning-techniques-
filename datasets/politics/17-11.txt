Success Nwogu, Abuja

The Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday said it would officially begin its Kogi State campaign during a ceremony in Lokoja on Friday.

The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement also said the party had uncovered plots allegedly by the All Progressives Congress and the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, to frustrate the campaign.

He, however, said the PDP members and supporters were already several steps ahead, ready to confront and stop the APC and Bello on their alleged plan.

The PDP spokesman also claimed that the PDP already had the support of over 70 per cent of registered voters in 18 out of the 21 local governments areas of the state.

Ologbondiyan said, “The party notes that though it has uncovered plots by the APC and Bello to frustrate the commencement of our campaign, our members and supporters, in their millions, are already several steps ahead, ready to confront and stop the APC and Governor Bello on their trails.

“Since we started our grass- roots campaigns in the last few weeks, the PDP has continued to receive overwhelming support, solidarity and endorsements from all segments of the voting population including political leaders and community groups, workers, pensioners, students, youth groups, business groups, professionals, and a host of other Kogites who have become despondent with the excruciating misrule of Yahaya Bello.

“This army of the Kogi people is fully rallied against any plot by the APC to derail any stage of the electoral process and they will not allow any infringement by anybody, no matter the machination.”
