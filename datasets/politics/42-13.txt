I’ll be too old for 2021 Anambra gov —Ngige
Tony Okafor, Awka

The Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, has debunked speculation that he is getting prepared to vie for the governorship of Anambra State in 2021.

Ngige, who spoke to our correspondent in Obosi, in the Idemili Local Government Area of the state, described the story as false.

He said, “That is not possible again. By 2021, I will be too old for that. So, you can see with me that is no longer plausible.”

The minister, however, noted that the All Progressives Congress was in top preparation for the 2021 governorships race.

The ex-governor stated, “Nothing will stop us this time from capturing the state in that election. We’re prepared and we’re ready.”

He said since he left office as governor of the state in 2006, nothing significant had been added to his achievements in the state.

Ngige said, “I just drove round the state; the only good roads you can ply in Anambra State were those built by me. It has become clear to our people that they need people like us to be happy once more.

“The APC will provide that happiness; we shall provide purposeful and responsive governance to our people once more in 2021.”

Asked about his take on the zoning of the governorship to Anambra South Senatorial District, Ngige said it was the ideal thing to do in the circumstances.

“We have no zoning arrangement in APC, but I think the most ideal thing to do is to allow Anambra South Senatorial District to produce the next governor of the state for equity’s sake,” he said.
