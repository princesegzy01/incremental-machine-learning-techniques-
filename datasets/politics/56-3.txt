Adelani Adepegba, Abuja

Some Zamfara youths under the aegis of the Health, Safety and Environment Charity Initiative, on Monday, protested at the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission headquarters in Abuja.

They alleged that the N300m released for the Zamfara central health sector constituency project had been diverted.

The leader of the group, Aminu Ahmad, after submitting a petition to the ICPC, told journalists that the N300m was meant for the procurement of healthcare facilities at the Federal Medical Centre, Gusau, Zamfara State.

Ahmad alleged that available records indicated that the money, which was released by the Federal Ministry of Finance to the Federal Ministry of Health since 2013, was allegedly diverted.

He said, “We were very surprised to discover that the project was not executed in the Federal Medical Centre, Gusau despite the release of the N300m to the Federal Ministry of Health.

“We seek your (ICPC) intervention to kindly investigate the circumstances surrounding the diversion of the funds meant for the good people of Zamfara State with a view to righting the wrongs.”

The spokesperson for the ICPC, Rasheedat Okoduwa, assured them that the commission would look into their grievances.

Okoduwa said, “Now that you have submitted the petition, we assure you that we shall look into it.

“Any offence that anybody commits or had committed since the establishment of the ICPC and the passing of the law in 2000; any offence of corruption committed falls under the purview of the ICPC and would be investigated.”
