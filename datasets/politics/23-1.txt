Ex-Rep defends Saraki, tackles Kogi former lawmaker
Former spokesman for the House of Representatives, Zakari Mohammed, has criticised his former colleague from Yagba Federal Constituency, Sunday Karimi, for accusing former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, of playing a role in the crisis in the Kogi State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party.

Karimi had blamed Saraki for the automatic tickets given to some federal legislators under the PDP in Kogi during the last general elections.

Zakari, in a statement on Wednesday, described the accusation as “mischievous,” “irresponsible” and “very unfortunate.”

He added, “It was an open secret that both in the PDP and the All Progressives Congress, after the gale of defections in the National Assembly before the last general elections, members who defected into the respective parties and those who refused to defect were given automatic tickets, except in a few, isolated cases.

“How then can Karimi, who lost in his aspiration to leave the House of Representatives to go and slug it out with Dino Melaye for the senatorial ticket, blame Saraki over his inability to get the ticket? Was it Saraki that conducted the screening and the primaries in Kogi State?”

Zakari, who represented the Baruten-Kaiama Federal Constituency from 2011 to 2019, advised Karimi to desist from dragging Saraki’s name into his “personal grouse” and loss.

The former lawmaker added, “We will not tolerate a situation where a Karimi, because he could not get the party’s senatorial ticket in the last election, would now be sabotaging genuine efforts of the party to win the next governorship poll in the state by making statements aimed at derailing genuine efforts to unite all members behind the party as the governorship election approaches.”
