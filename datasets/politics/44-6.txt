APC Youths protest Buhari’s appointment, seek 40%
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The Youths wing of the All Progressives Congress’ has protested against the exclusion of youths from the appointments so far made by President Muhammadu Buhari.

The group said the appointments were not a fair representation of them and the sacrifices they made to the reelection of the President.

The National Youth Leader, Sadiq Abubakar, stated this after a familiarisation and appreciation meeting with support groups at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja.

He said, “Basically, what was discussed was to see how policies are being made that will protect the youth and get us involved in governance.

“Some of us have discussed about our plights and how much that will be offered to youths as their contributions to the party.”

“We have submitted a communiqué to the Presidency and the party where we demanded 40 per cent representation in government.

“The executive as constituted in the council, that is the ministers; we haven’t found much of our representation there as a part of the youth wing.”
