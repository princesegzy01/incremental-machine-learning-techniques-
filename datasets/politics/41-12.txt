I’ve no intention to seek third term through surrogate –Emmanuel
Patrick Odey

Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel, has said he has no plans to seek a third term by using a surrogate.

The governor said this when members of the Mboho Mkparawa Ibibio, a sociocultural organisation of the Ibibio youth, met him at the Government House on Friday.

The group, led by Patrick Udofia, had met with the governor to congratulate him on his victory at the tribunal.

“I usually hear people say I have anointed someone who will take over from me so I can manipulate him to do my bidding after leaving the office. I want to assure you that it is not true.

“As I speak, it is only God who knows who my successor will be. When God presents him, we will support him to also succeed,” Emmanuel said.

The governor commended the group for its role in maintaining peace in the state and thanked the Akwa Ibom people for their support towards sustaining the development of the state.

Earlier in his remarks, Udofia said the association would keep supporting the governor so as to develop the state.

The governor had earlier met with the leadership of the National Association of Akwa Ibom State Students, saying his administration would continue to prioritise education.
