Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The University Security Committee of the University of Ibadan, on Monday, recommended armed police patrol on campus to stem the tide of rising insecurity and armed robberies in the institution.

The committee in a special bulletin signed by the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Idowu Olayinka, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH, said the decision was arrived at, after reviewing of the security situation in UI.

The bulletin read in part, “There will be armed policemen from the Oyo State Police Command to compliment the campus security service in patrolling the campus with immediate effect.

“All business outfits, including restaurants, should close at 9pm daily.

“The campus security service will embark on random checks of staff quarters to identify unauthorised occupants of university residences.

“The above measures have been taken in order to ensure the safety and security of life and property in the community.”
