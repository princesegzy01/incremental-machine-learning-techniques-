Appeal Court declares APC winner of Billiri/Balanga federal constituency
Chima Azubuike, Gombe

The presiding judge of the Court of Appeal sitting in Jos division, Justice H.A. Abiru on Thursday dismissed the appeal of the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the Balanga /Billiri Federal Constituency, Ali Isa, challenging the verdict of the National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal which upheld the victory of Victor Mela of the All Progressives Congress.

Abiru, who read over 200-pages before delivering the judgement said the appellant Ali Isa, through his counsels failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the number of polling units which was alleged to have been affected by electoral malpractice and violence should be cancelled.

Justice Abiru said that the appellant was not consistent with the number of polling units where electoral malpractice allegedly took place.

He said the Justice Ajuwa-led tribunal in Gombe did not in anyway err in their judgement.

In the end justice Abiru struck out the appeal brought by Ali Isa J.C and thereby declared Victor Mela Danzaria returned.

It will be recalled that INEC during the February 23 polls declared Victor Mela as duly elected but Ali Isa who was not satisfied with the outcome challenged the results at the election petition tribunal which he lost before proceeding to the Court of Appeal in Jos.
