A minister designate, Gbemisola Saraki, has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s 43-man ministers designate as “decent and honourable people”.

Saraki said this in a statement on Saturday.

Some individuals and groups have been faulting the list, especially as it relates to some of the nominees said to be undergoing investigations for corruption-related matters.

But Saraki said the majority of them on the list were in politics not to amass wealth, but to serve humanity.

She said, “As we join hands across the many divides of our beautiful rainbow, we are reminded of the responsibility to the many men and women who look to us for their tomorrow.

“I thank you all for your support and prayers during my screening as a ministerial nominee of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

“The vast majority, if not all of the 43 ministers designate, are upright, decent, honourable men and women, who have come into politics not to feather their nests, but because they have heeded the call of public service.

“I for one, with this nomination, feel deeply honoured and humbled by the faith, trust and confidence that our President, Muhammadu Buhari, has shown in me. For this, I thank him deeply.”
