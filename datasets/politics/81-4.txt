The Lagos State House of Assembly’s 16-man ad hoc committee for screening Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s commissioners and special adviser nominees on Saturday completed the screening of the 25 nominees sent by the governor.

The News Agency of Nigeria reported that the committee, headed by Mr Rotimi Abiru, a four-term lawmaker representing Somolu Constituency II, had commenced the exercise on Thursday through Friday before it ended on Saturday.

The report noted that Abiru, at the end of the screening of each nominee, told them that the House would get back to them through the governor.

Speaking to newsmen at the conclusion of the exercise on Saturday, Abiru expressed satisfaction with the competence of the nominees, saying the committee would prepare a report and forward it to the House for a final decision. “By then, we will know who among the nominees will make it to serve in the government,” he added.

He pointed out that the nominees would have to appear before the House during plenary but without the rigorous drilling they went through before the committee.
