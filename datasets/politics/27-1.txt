APC chief faults suspension of Edo council bosses
A leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress in Edo State, Mr John Mayaki, has condemned the suspension of four council chairmen from office by the state government.

The chairmen are Yakubu Musa (Etsako West), Aligame Momoh (Etsako East), Patrick Aguinede (Esan West) and Ms Eghe Ogbemudia (Egor). Some of them were suspended over alleged corruption.

However, Mayaki insisted that their suspension was “illegal, lawlessness, unconstitutional and a violation of the protected duties of the councils to independently administer their affairs”.

In a statement on Friday, the ex-Chief Press Secretary to Governor Godwin Obaseki accused his former boss of violating a Supreme Court judgment delivered in 2016 where a five-man panel led by Justice Olabode Rhodes-Vivour ruled on an appeal of a similar suspension of council executives in Ekiti State.

APC chief said, “The Supreme Court judgment held that Section 7(1) of the constitution guarantees the system of local government by democratically elected local government councils…

“It, therefore, strips the governor of any power to unilaterally remove elected council officials or interfere in the councils’ dealings without violating the constitution he swore to protect.”
