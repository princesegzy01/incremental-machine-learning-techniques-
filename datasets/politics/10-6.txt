Agbo, contended that the facts before the panel showed that the petitioner could not prove his claims of over-voting, violence and mutilation.

He awarded N100,000 cost to the first respondent, his party, PDP.

Emeka, who reacted after the appeal court upheld his victory, said that he would now concentrate and deliver the dividends of democracy to his constituents.

The lawmaker said “I call on Nnanna Igbokwe to join hands with me for the development of our federal constituency. I commend him for his dogged fight up till this point but the interests and the wellbeing of the people must supersede personal goals.”
