Top UK minister quits, dealing Boris Johnson new Brexit blow
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson received a fresh blow Saturday when senior minister Amber Rudd quit her work and pensions post in protest at his handling of the Brexit crisis.

“I have resigned from Cabinet and surrendered the Conservative Whip,” Rudd tweeted.

“I cannot stand by as good, loyal moderate Conservatives are expelled,” she said, referring to Johnson’s decision to expel 21 MPs from the Conservative party for voting against the government.
