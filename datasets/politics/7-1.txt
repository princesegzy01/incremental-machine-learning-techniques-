Kogi election: Idris asks son, followers to work for PDP
Success Nwogu, Abuja

A former Governor of Kogi State, Ibrahim Idris, on Tuesday directed his son, Abubakar, his followers and his political structure in the state, Ibro Political Family, to work for the victory of the Peoples Democratic Party in the November 16 governorship election.

Abubakar, who was an aspirant during the September 3 PDP governorship primary, confirmed the directive in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja.

He, however, clarified that the directive was not to work for the victory of the Kogi PDP governorship candidate, Musa Wada, but for the victory of the party in the election.

According to him, the directive was made during the stakeholders’ meeting of the political structure including the coordinators in the local government areas of the state.

He clarified that his father’s directive and his insistence to continue the court matter meant that if the PDP emerged victorious in the governorship election and the court ruled in his favour, he would become the governor of the state.

Abubakar said, “He (Idris) did not direct that we should work for the victory of Musa Wada. He directed that we should work for the success or victory of the PDP in the state.

“We are the PDP members. Are we not going to work for our party? He said we would work for the party so that the party could succeed and win the election.”
