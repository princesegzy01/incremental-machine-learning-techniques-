Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

The immediate past governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has called on his successor, Emeka Ihedioha, to sanction the Secretary to the State Government, Uche Onstaguocha, for ordering his (Okorocha’s) arrest.

Okorocha in a statement on Sunday by his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, said the arrest order against him by the SSG which the governor had described as unlawful, was unfortunate.

Okorocha, who now represents Imo West in the Senate, described himself as a peaceful man, who had never fought anybody while he was the governor of the state.

The statement read in part, “Governor Emeka Ihedioha has been reported in the media to have said that he never ordered the arrest of his predecessor, Senator Rochas Okorocha.

“On our part, we want to commend the governor for the denial having known that the arrest order was uncivilised, disgraceful and embarrassing to the state, although the denial came several weeks after the incident had happened.”
