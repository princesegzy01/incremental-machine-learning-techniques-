John Ameh, Abuja

The Presidency has said that the death of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, the daughter of Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, is tragic and regrettable, but adds that politicising it will not help the unity of the country.

It said that President Muhammadu Buhari’s thoughts and prayers were with the family over the incident.

In a statement on Monday night by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, the Presidency expressed reservations over comments being made by some Nigerian leaders over the incident, saying that the issue was being politicised.

It called on all Nigerians to work together to fight insecurity as a national problem.

The Presidency stated, “The Presidency has noted public concerns on the unfortunate attack leading to the death of the daughter of the Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti.

“The President has already issued a statement expressing his heartfelt condolences to the family of Mrs Funke Olakunrin and followed up with a telephone call.

“The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo has, in addition, paid a visit to the grieving family in Akure, Ondo State.

“Her death is a tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.

“It is incumbent on all leaders across the country to consider their language and its potential consequences.

“Insecurity is an issue that Nigeria must face together as one nation – united.

“Times of tragedy like these are not the time for politics. It reveals only disrespect for the departed and her family. And we hope that those who stand in positions of influence recognise and understand this.”
