Group holds two million-man march for Kogi gov
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

A group, Okara Political Group, on Thursday held a two million-man march in support of the re-election bid of the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello.

The participants marched from Lokongoma Phase I to the Government House, Lokoja.

Apart from the members of the group, supporters of the ruling All Progressives Congress from the 21 local government areas of the state also participated in the march.

Addressing the crowd, Bello, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Abdulkareem Asuku, assured them that their efforts would not be in vain.

He appealed to them to conduct themselves peacefully before, during and after the election.

He also promised to consolidate the achievements recorded during his first term if given another opportunity.

He said, “I am assuring you that if you do the needful in the forthcoming governorship election, I will not forget any of you.”

“It is a fact that since the creation of Kogi State in 1991, this is the first administration that recognised the youths in terms of appointments and we will do more in our second tenure by the grace of God.”

The Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals, Abdulmumuni Okara, said the march was meant to mobilise people of the state to vote for the governor.
