Friday Olokor, Abuja

The collection of Permanent Voter Cards for the governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states will take place between September 2 and 30, the Independent National Electoral Commission has said.

The commission said it would engage the services of faith-based, professional, civil society and community-based organisations to create awareness for the collection of PVCs.

INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of its Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, made the announcement in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja.

He said before the commencement of the exercise fixed for between 9am and 3pm (weekdays), the Resident Electoral Commissioners of the two states would organised stakeholders meetings in the states and local government areas between August 26 and 30 to sensitise them to the modalities for the collection of the PVCs in the various communities.

The commission also put the total number of uncollected PVCs for Kogi State at 170,644, while that of Bayelsa State stood at 49, 291.

Okoye said, “There will be two teams of DOs per LGA and the officers will rotate the distribution of the PVCs in the RAs or from community to community based on a schedule agreed upon by the REC and the stakeholders.”
