Appeal Court sacks House Majority Leader, Doguwa
Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

The Kaduna Division of the Court of Appeal on Monday sacked the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Doguwa.

The Independent National Electoral Commission had declared Doguwa as the winner of the February 23 National Assembly election in Tudun-Wada/Doguwa Constituency in Kano State.

But the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for the polls, Yusha’u Salisu, petitioned the Election Petitions Tribunal, alleging that the election was marred by irregularities.

But on September 5, the tribunal dismissed his petition, confirming his All Progressives Congress rival Doguwa as the winning of the election on the grounds that he could not prove his allegations of irregularities and over voting.

However, in a unanimous judgment on Monday, the appellate court headed by Justice Oludotun Adefope-Okojie set aside the ruling of the tribunal and nullified Doguwa’s election.

The court said the entire process was marred by irregularities and ordered INEC to conduct a fresh election within 90 days.
