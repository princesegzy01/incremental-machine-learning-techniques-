PDP condemns anti-Ambode protest at Lagos Assembly
The Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos State has condemned the recent protest at the state House of Assembly, calling for the probe of former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode.

A statement by Mr Taofik Gani, Lagos PDP spokesperson on Thursday in Lagos, said that the protest lacked sincerity of purpose and was obviously aimed at embarrassing the immediate past governor.

A group, under the aegis of the Lagos Youth Vanguard, led Rasak Olokooba, and Ibrahim Ekundina, had on Tuesday stormed the Lagos Assembly, demanding a probe of the former governor.

“Such protests tend to overheat the polity and prompt increased loss of confidence in the government,” the PDP said.
