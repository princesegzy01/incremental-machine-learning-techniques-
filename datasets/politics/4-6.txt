JUST IN: Akpabio wins appeal, court orders rerun in LG
Ada Wodu, Calabar

The Court of Appeal sitting in Calabar has ordered a rerun in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State where Senator Godswill Akpabio lost to Senator Christopher Ekpenyong in the February 23, 2019 senatorial election in Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District.

Akpabio, who is currently the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs and candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the election, had gone to the Court of Appeal to challenge the decision of the election petition tribunal to declare the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ekpenyong, winner.

The court ordered a rerun in Essien Udim within 90 days.
