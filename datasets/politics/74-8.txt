PDP sweeps Bayelsa council election
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The council election conducted in Bayelsa State on Saturday by the State Independent Electoral Commission in the eight local government areas and 105 wards of the state was a one-way traffic as the Peoples Democratic Party won all the councils.

The chairman of the BYSIEC, Mr Remember Ogbe, led officials of the commission to preside over the collation and declaration of the results by the returning officers at the commissionâ€™s secretariat in Yenagoa on Saturday.

Ogbe stated in his remarks that the voting process was peaceful and hitch-free in the council areas, claiming that voters turned out in large numbers to cast their votes for candidates of their choice.

Recall that the main opposition party in the state, the All Progressives Congress, did not participate in the election.
