Adeniyi Olugbemi, Sokoto

The National and State Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Sokoto, on Wednesday, dismissed the petitions filed against the election of two members of the Sokoto State House of Assembly of the All Progressives Congress, Kabiru Dauda (Gada East), and Abubakar Zakari (Rabah).

One of the petitioners, Garba Tsitse, who was the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, had alleged, among others, that Dauda was not duly elected.

Tsitse said the APC candidate had not scored the majority of lawful votes cast and the election was not conducted in substantial compliance with the Electoral Act, 2010, as amended, as well the Independent National Electoral Commission guidelines for the 2019 general elections.

In his judgment, the Chairman of the tribunal, Justice Ubale Musa, held that the election of Dauda was valid, as he had scored the majority of the lawful votes cast and that the election was conducted in compliance with all the extant electoral laws of the nation.

Justice Yusuf, therefore, submitted, “The petition has failed, lacks merit and it is therefore dismissed accordingly, with no costs awarded.”

In a related development, the PDP candidate for Rabah, Abubakar Gandi, in his petition challenging the declaration of Zakari as the winner by INEC, alleged that Zakari was not duly elected, adding that he had not scored the majority of lawful votes cast and that the poll had breached the subsisting electoral laws.

Justice Ubale Musa, ruled that the declaration of Zakari as the winner of the poll had complied with the extant electoral laws of Nigeria.
