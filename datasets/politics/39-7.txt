Ade Adesomoju, Abuja

The Court of Appeal in Abuja on Tuesday reserved judgments in three separate appeals against the August 23, 2019 judgment of an election petitions tribunal which removed Dino Melaye as the senator representing Kogi West.

Justice Abubakar Yahaya, who presided over the three-man panel of the Court of the Appeal, said the date of judgments, when fixed, would be announced to the parties through their lawyers.

The three appeals were filed by Melaye, his party, the Peoples Democratic Party, and the Independent National Electoral Commission to challenge the verdict of the Kogi State National/State Assembly Election Tribunal in Abuja delivered on August 23.

The three-man tribunal, led by Justice A.O. Chijioke, had in a split two-to-one decision, ordered INEC to conduct a fresh election within 90 days.
