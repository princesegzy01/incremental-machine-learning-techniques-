Secondus subverting PDP constitution for Dickson – Group
Success Nwogu, Abuja

The Peoples Democratic Party South-South Youth Vanguard on Monday alleged that the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, was trying to subvert the party’s constitution to please the Bayelsa State Governor, Mr Seriake Dickson, and some stakeholders ahead of the party’s governorship primary.

The National Chairman of the group, Mr James Akpofure, in a statement further alleged that Secondus was working for the interest of Dickson to allegedly manipulate the primary in the state.

Akpofure said, “The newly elected chairmen of Bayelsa State Local Governments are not qualified to contest the September 3 primary. The chairman is supporting Governor Dickson to see if the chairmen can vote in the forthcoming primary against the constitution of the party.”

He urged the PDP National Chairman to play a fatherly role in the primary.

But Secondus in a response by his media aide, Ike Abonyi, stated that the allegations were baseless and unfounded.

Abonyi said that Akpofure and his group might be ignorant of the party’s constitution, adding that otherwise they would have known that there was no way Secondus can influence the outcome of any congress.
