PDP tackles DSS over Dadiyata’s abduction
Success Nwogu, Abuja

The Peoples Democratic Party has urged the Department of State Services to speak out on allegations that its men were involved in the violent abduction of a social activist and PDP new media personality, Abubakar Idris, popularly known as Abu Hanifa Dadiyata, since last Friday.

The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement, said the DSS could not continue to keep quiet on the issue as there were claims in the public domain that its men allegedly participated in the abduction at the behest of interests affiliated to the All Progressives Congress.

He stated that Idris was known for his fierce criticism of the APC and its administration, particularly in Kano State.

He said, “There are already public insinuations that Dadiyata’s abduction to an unknown destination is not unconnected with an apparent desperation to intimidate, suppress and silence public opinion and free speech in Nigeria as well as to further entrench a siege mentality on our citizenry.

“The PDP therefore demands that the DSS high command speak out and take urgent steps to secure the release of Dadiyata from his abductors before it is too late.

“This is especially because the polity is already overheated and any delay in the release of Dadiyata is capable of triggering further aggressions in our polity, particularly in Kano State, where he commands a very large following.”
