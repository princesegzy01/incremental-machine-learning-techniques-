Don’t retrench workers, SAN cautions Ayade
Ada Wodu, Calabar

A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mba Ukweni, has cautioned Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, against retrenching workers.

Ukweni said downsizing of government workforce while promising polling unit agents employment was not the right thing to do.

Speaking with journalists in Calabar on Thursday, the SAN alleged that “Governor Ben Ayade in a meeting with politicians promised every polling unit agent an appointment when some civil servants have not been paid for several months now.

“People who have been given employment, both as teachers, magistrates and health workers have not been paid since they were employed, yet he has promised polling units agents employment.

“You can imagine the number of polling units we have in the state. He is crying of lack of money; what sort of logic is that? It doesn’t make sense to me and it’s a major problem we have in the state.”

Ukweni further alleged that when the governor employed several appointees in the state, “there was no office for them to sit down and function but, at the end of the month, they received salary alerts.”

The lawyer appealed to Ayade not to retrench the civil servants, magistrates, teachers, health workers and others whose names had already been dropped from the payroll.
