Senate raises panel on Edo Assembly crisis
Sunday Aborisade, Abuja

The Senate, on Wednesday, set up an ad hoc committee to investigate the crisis in the Edo State House of Assembly with a view to preventing further crisis in the state legislature.

The red chamber took the decision following a point of order by Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, who said such intervention would arrest the crisis and save the nationâ€™s democracy.

The Senate advised the committee to liaise with the House of Representatives committee already investigating the matter.

Senator Mathew Urhoghide, representing Edo South Senatorial District, urged his colleagues to carry on with the intervention.

The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, thereafter constituted the panel with Senator Aliyu Sabi as chairman.

Other members include Chukwuka Utazi, Gabriel Suswam, Aisha Ahmed and Ahmed Kaita.
