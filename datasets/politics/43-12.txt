Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

The Governor of Imo state, Emeka Ihedioha, has said that his one-week trip to the United States will boost the economy of the state.

Ihedioha’s Chief Press Secretary, Chibuike Onyeukwu, in a statement, quoted the governor as saying he held “useful” deliberations and interfaced with the Congressional Black Caucus, the US State Department, the World Bank, the Department for International Development, and the United States Agency for International Development during the course of his visit.

The governor, who spoke on his arrival at the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, returned from his second visit to the US since his swearing-in three months ago.

The statement read, “He (Ihedioha) said his discussions with these international agencies will yield desired results for the State soon, which is in line with his campaign promises to look beyond the shores of Imo State in the task of rebuilding the state.

“He said the need to consciously tackle the enormous challenges confronting the state made it imperative to seek collaboration with partners to support the efforts of his administration’s Rebuild Imo Agenda.

“Governor Ihedioha further explained that such collaborations became necessary in view of what his administration intends to achieve for the benefit of the people.”
