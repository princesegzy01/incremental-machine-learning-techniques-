YIAGA AFRICA has said it has concluded training of 1,077 citizen observers in both Kogi and Bayelsa states ahead of the November 16 governorship elections in both states.

A statement by the Executive Director, Samson Itodo, said the training was carried out under the theme, “Watching the Vote project.”

“The observers were trained on the essentials of election observation beginning from understanding the election day process as provided in the Independent National Electoral Commission’s manuals and election guidelines, election day deployment, to the WTV observation methodology, using the observation forms and reporting and then guidelines/principles for election observation in line with the global principles of Global Network for Domestic Election Monitors,” Itodo said.

He said 22 master trainers were deployed in 20 training centres across eight local government areas in Bayelsa State to train 520 observers while 26 master trainers trained 526 citizen observers across the 21 local government areas of Kogi State.

“In addition, a total of 29 LGA results collation observers were also trained by the WTV team. The training has adequately prepared citizen observers to observe the November 16 governorship election which includes the Kogi West Senatorial election,” Itodo noted.

He added that the observers had been trained in how to observe the use and functionality of smart card readers.
