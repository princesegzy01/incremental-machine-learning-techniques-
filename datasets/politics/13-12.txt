bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, on Monday inaugurated the newly constituted governing council for the state-owned polytechnic in Aleibiri, under the chairmanship of a former Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Mr Mike Zuokumor.

He also inaugurated the new board of the Bayelsa State Environmental Sanitation Authority chaired by a former caretaker committee chairman of the Ekeremor Local Government Area, Mr Tolu Amatu.

Speaking at the events held at the Government House, Yenagoa, the governor advised the council and the sanitation authority chairmen to bring their wealth of experience to bear in the repositioning of the stateâ€™s economic and education sectors.

Dickson in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, described the establishment of the polytechnic as timely as it would provide the much needed high and middle-level manpower and technical skills required by the oil and gas industry.

Dickson, who also said environmental challenges would be daunting after the current flood disaster, called on the members of the environment authority be up to the task of making Bayelsa cleaner.
