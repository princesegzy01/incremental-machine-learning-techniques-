EFCC donates Badeh’s property to VON
Adelani Adepegba, Abuja

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on Wednesday, handed over a choice property forfeited by the late Chief of Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, to the Voice of Nigeria to serve as its headquarters.

The property, located on Plot 1386 Uda Crescent, off Aminu Kano Crescent, Wuse 2, Abuja, was handed over to VON by the EFCC Secretary, Olanipekun Olukoyede, who represented the acting Chairman of the commission, Ibrahim Magu.

Magu said, “The event taking place today is going a long way to prove to critics that the war against corruption is real; the battle has come to stay. If we are able to fight corruption in Nigeria concertedly, we would have solved 70 per cent of Nigeria’s problem.”

While expressing sadness over the corruption in the society, the EFCC boss praised President Muhammadu Buhari for providing the conducive atmosphere and political will to sustain the anti-corruption fight.

“Within a few years, we have moved from stolen billions to trillions. Imagine the number of hospitals the trillions could have built but was never built, the number of students the stolen funds could have sponsored on scholarship that but will now, never go to school,” Magu said.
