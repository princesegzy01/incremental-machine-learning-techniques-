Nigerians must support Igbo presidency in 2023 – Iwuanyanwu
Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia

Elder statesman and frontline politician, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, has said the South-East geopolitical zone must be allowed to produce the next President in 2023.

This, he said would make Nigeria to actually move to the next level of social, economic and political emancipation.

Iwuanyanwu stated this in an interview with journalists in Umuahia, after an inaugural lecture organised by the Eastern People’s Consultative Forum.

He pointed out that the current security challenges which appeared to have defiled all solutions, could be tackled by a President of South-East extraction.

He said, “Every good Nigerian, every good Muslim, every good Christian must support a president of Nigeria of South-East extraction.

“If Nigerians have conscience, equity and justice demand that they should allow the Igbo to produce the next President in 2023.

“I have made consultations to different Nigerians in the North. I have made consultations in the South-West and 80 per cent of them are in support of a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction and of South-East region.”

Iwuanyanwu expressed his disappointment over what he called, “leadership failures in Nigeria.”

He said the Ndigbo are highly detribalised and could be found in the remotest villages in Nigeria, living peacefully and doing their businesses and paying their taxes.
