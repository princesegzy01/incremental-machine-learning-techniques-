Gunmen raid Rivers community, kidnap two
Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt

Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have invaded Amariari community in the Bonny Local Government Area of Rivers State and kidnapped two persons.

The gunmen, according to a source from the area, came into the community around 5am on Wednesday.

It was gathered that the hoodlums, who came through the waterways, robbed residents of cash and other belongings before whisking away two indigenes of the area.

The incident happened barely four days after pirates hijacked two boats and abducted a councillor and another prominent person from the Bonny LGA.

A resident, Richy, said, “It happened in the early hours of today (Wednesday) in Amariari in Finima. The kidnappers took away two persons after robbing others of their cash and property.

“We are calling on government and security agencies to beef up security in the Bonny LGA.”

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Nnamdi Omoni, told our correspondent that he was not aware of the incident.
