Ondo dep gov restates loyalty to Akeredolu
Peter Dada, Akure

The Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Mr Agboola Ajayi, has denied insinuations of rancour between him and the state Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, over next year’s governorship election in the state.

Ajayi stated this in Akure, the state capital on Tuesday during his 51st birthday.

He said, “All that is being written about me in the recent time is expected. This is a political period where politicians get to hear all manner of cooked-up stories.

“Prior to the last governorship election in the state when my boss (Akeredolu) emerged, I told him I would support him in any way possible. Initially, I didn’t have interest until he picked me as his deputy.

“A lot of people are saying a lot of things about me and the governor; all that is being said are fabrications; there is no need to pay attention to such.”
