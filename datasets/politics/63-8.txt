‘Tinubu’s critics‘ll soon hail his qualities’
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo

The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Osun State, Prince Gboyega Famodun, said on Sunday that critics of a former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, would soon realise his qualities as a politician.

Famodun, in a statement in Osogbo by his media aide, Kola Olabisi, said winning governorship elections in five out of six South-West states in the 2019 general elections was due to Tinubu’s political dexterity and leadership qualities.

The APC chairman also maintained that the ex-Lagos governor remains “a meticulous political talent hunter, whose leadership roles in the South-West in particular, and the nation in general can be likened to that of the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.

He said, “It was not by accident of history that those who attended Tinubu’s school of progressive politics are today making waves in various capacities at the national level.”

He, however, urged Tinubu’s political students to emulate the good virtues of the national leader of the APC by equally engaging in political talent hunt with a view to retaining progressive government in the South-West for a long time.
