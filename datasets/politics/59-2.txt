Youths’ participation will solve many Nigeria’s problems – Gbajabiamila
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has said half of the challenges confronting Nigeria will be over if youths are properly engaged in the administration of the country.

Gbajabiamila, who was represented by the Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, said this at the National Christian and Muslim Youths Summit in Abuja on Thursday.

According to a statement by the Deputy Speaker’s Chief Press Secretary, Umar Puma, Gbajabiamila urged the youth to resist being used by politicians to cause trouble along religious lines.

The Speaker, who lamented that some politicians had continued to use religion to cause mayhem in the country, stated that, “This should not be the case because we are all human beings and were created by God.”

He said, “I believe if we get it right with the youth, we will have solved at least 50 per cent of the nation’s problems.

“In a secular state such as ours, religious tolerance should be the watchword. We must appreciate the fact that we are all created by one God and must resist the temptation of engaging in inter religious crisis and continuous killing of innocent people in the name of religion.

“If the youth, who are often engaged by unscrupulous persons to perpetrate violence, get to understand and apply what both faiths teach, sponsors of crimes will not see anyone to enlist for evil.”

According to the Speaker, both Islam and Christianity are religions of peace and adherents of both faiths believe in resurrection, judgment and paradise.
