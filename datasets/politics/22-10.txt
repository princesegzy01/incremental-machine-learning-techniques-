APC faults Dickson over ‘govt of criminals’ comment
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The All Progressives Congress in Bayelsa State has dismissed claims by Governor Seriake Dickson that the party was about to form “a government of criminals and cultists” in the state.

The APC was reacting to the governor’s accusation in a statement on Wednesday by its state Publicity Secretary, Mr Doifie Buokoribo, who is also the Secretary, Media and Publicity Committee of the party’s Governorship Campaign Council for the election.

Dickson had made the claim on Monday in Yenagoa at the inauguration of the Peoples Democratic Party governorship election campaign office and team.

But the APC said, “At its elemental level, Governor Seriake Dickson’s deception machine has essentially run on creating falsehood around formidable opponents as a ploy to justify intended poll rigging and violence.

“Dickson and his cohorts in the PDP will suffer the inevitable outcome of embodying the elemental forces of failure: they will be roundly defeated by the APC.”
