Edward Nnachi, Abakaliki

The Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has sacked his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Emma Uzor.

The governor stated this in a post he dropped on Tuesday on the Information Officers’ platform, where himself, information officers and the state executive members are members.

Umahi wrote, “I just directed the termination of the appointment of my CPS for misrepresenting me and the South-East governors on National Livestock Transformation Plan Programme.”
