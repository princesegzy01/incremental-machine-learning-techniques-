Mudiaga Affe

A former member of the Lagos State House of Assembly on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr Tajudeeen Agoro, has said that the opposition party cannot add value to the lives of Lagos residents.

Agoro, who was also the collation agent for the PDP governorship candidate, Mr Jimi Agbaje, in the 2015 and 2019 elections said this in Lagos on Friday when he defected to the All Progressives Congress in the state.

The former lawmaker applauded the efforts of former governor of the state, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, describing him as a leader with mission and vision.

He said, “The way the PDP is going about it in Lagos, there is no way they can add value to people in Lagos, I have been in it, and I have seen it all. I need to move forward because I want to be part of those adding value to Lagos State.”

Chairman of the Lagos State chapter of the APC, Alhaji Tunde Balogun, said with the defection of Agoro, who was a member of the state House of Assembly between 1999 and 2003, the PDP was dead in Lagos mainland.

Receiving Agoro and his team at the party secretariat, Balogun said the former lawmaker’s defection was a blessing to APC.
