Appeal court adjourns hearing on Useniâ€™s petition
James Abraham, Jos

The Court of Appeal sitting in Jos has adjourned hearing on the case challenging the election of Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State till November 22, 2019.

Justice J.O. Bada fixed the new date in his ruling on Monday when he led four other justices to hear the appeal filed by the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate, Senator Jeremiah Useni, and his party.

Counsel for Useni and the PDP, S. G. Odey, told the appeal panel that his team had filed the appeal briefs within the time specified under the Electoral Act.

In the briefs containing 37 decided cases, Useni argued why the judgment of the lower court, which had earlier dismissed his case, should be reversed in his favour.

But counsel for Lalong, P.A Akubo, SAN, and that of the All Progressives Congress, G.S. Paul, SAN, in their briefs, told the court that they had filed two cross appeals on the matter.

Justice Bada announced that the main appeal and the two cross appeals would be heard the same day, and adjourned hearing to Friday, November 22, 2019.
