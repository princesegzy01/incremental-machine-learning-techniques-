Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Bayelsa State Independent Electoral Commission has issued certificates of return to the chairmen-elect of the eight local governments areas who were elected in the council poll held on Saturday.

Also presented with certificates of return at the BYSIEC secretariat in Yenagoa on Tuesday were the councillors-elect of the 105 wards in the state.

The Peoples Democratic Party won all the seats in all the local governments and the wards.

Chairman of the BYSIEC, Mr. Remember Ogbe, said his commission had carried out what was required by law by issuing certificates of return to them.

He advised them to keep in touch with the Bayelsa State Government to know when they would be inaugurated.
