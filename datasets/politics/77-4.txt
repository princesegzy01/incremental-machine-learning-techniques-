Ted Odogwu, Kano

The State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Kano, on Thursday, said judgment on the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party challenging the election of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of the All Progressive Congress would be delivered in October.

Earlier, counsel to the petitioners, Adegboyega Awomolo (SAN), told the tribunal that he had finished presenting his case.

Justice Halima Shamakin warned that the tribunal would not accommodate delay tactics from the respondents, saying INEC, Ganduje and the APC had been directed to put up their defence serially.

The judge explained that the call for the opening of defence by the respondents would not concede to request for short adjournment.
