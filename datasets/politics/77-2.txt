Ex-gov brother joins Kogi gov race, pledges liberty
A governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, Musa Wada, has joined the governorship race in Kogi State with a promise to emancipate the traumatised and oppressed people of the state.

Addressing journalists on Thursday at the PDP secretariat in Lokoja, Wada said that his aspiration for the governorship was quite distinct from that of his elder brother, Captain Idris Wada, a former governor of the state.

Wada said his emancipation project started two years ago following what he alleged, “a total system destruction of the state by those that accidentally found themselves in the corridors of power.”

The PDP governorship hopeful maintained that he was resolute in his avowed plan to “emancipate Kogi State and free the people from the All Progressives Congress bondage.”

He claimed that fake and fragile unity existed in the state as people with common interest of strangulating the state, accidentally found themselves in charge of the resources which they failed to manage.

Wada said, “Mismagemement of the Youth and their potentials is a matter of serious concern, while the human and natural resources have been neglected.”

He promised that the misguided youth would be rehabilitated and engaged in gainful ventures that would guarantee their potentials and wealth.

The aspirant, who expressed satisfaction with the reformed PDP in the state, promised that with the commitment of the new executives, the party would bounce back to power.
