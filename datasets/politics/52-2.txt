Abiodun Nejo, Ado Ekiti

The Chairman, Ekiti State House of Assembly Committee on State Independent Electoral Commission, Akeem Jamiu, has assured the state electoral body of the lawmakers’ support to ensure a hitch-free local government election.

Jamiu said working closely with the electoral body would enable it to get all it needed for the conduct of a free, fair, credible, transparent and acceptable local government election in December.

The lawmaker stated this at the Assembly complex on Friday while hosting a delegation of SIEC.

He said, “You must be transparent in all your undertakings and be fair to all political parties for you to be able to conduct acceptable elections.”

The Ekiti SIEC Chairman, Justice Jide Aladejana, represented by Mr Babatunde Akilo, said the visit was to update the committee on the activities of the commission, explaining that efforts had begun towards delivering on the electoral body’s mandate of conducting a peaceful and credible local government poll.

The electoral body’s Executive Secretary, Mrs Modupe Akinbolawa, hailed members of the House Committee on SIEC for their encouragement.
