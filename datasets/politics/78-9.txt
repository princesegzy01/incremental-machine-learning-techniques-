The Chairman of the committee on the recovery of stolen movable assets belonging to the Imo State Government, Jasper Ndubuaku, has said that the committee has recovered over 70 vehicles since its inauguration by Governor Emeka Ihedioha.

Ndubuaku, who spoke to our correspondent in Owerri, the state capital, on Tuesday, said that the committee had equally recovered two ashphat plants.

The governor’s aide said that the committee had recovered properties worth N1bn.

Ndubuaku, who served as a lawmaker in the state between 1999 and 2007, said the committee was not on a witch-hunt as being alleged by the immediate past governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha.

According to him, not all the recovered properties belonged to the members of the Okoorcha family.

He said that the committee equally recovered some of the properties from the former aides and appointees of Okorocha.
