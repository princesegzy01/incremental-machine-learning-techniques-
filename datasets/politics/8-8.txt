Olaide Oyelude, Katsina

The All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party in Katsina State have picked candidates for the November 30 by-election for the Sabuwa constituency in the state House of Assembly.

Ibrahim Danjuma emerged the APC standard bearer from the party primaries held at Sabuwa on Sunday, while the PDP had earlier chosen Shafiu Inono.

The by-election is to fill the vacant seat for the Sabuwa constituency in the House of Assembly, following the death of its representative, Mustapha Abdullahi, in a motor accident on July 5.

The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Jibril Zarewa, stated that political parties participating in the election had been given up to November 28 to campaign for the election.

He added that the commission had set aside November 11 to 14 for the collection of Permanent Voter Cards in the local government area.

According to him, 61,991 PVCs have been collected by voters in the council, while 1,442 PVCs are uncollected.

Zarewa, who had earlier said the commission would employ 521 ad hoc staff for the election, was not categorical on whether corps members would be among them.
