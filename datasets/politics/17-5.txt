Stop intimidating Abia North, ex-council boss warns Kalu
Ogbonnaya Ikokwu, Umuahia

A former Chairman of Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State, Chief Amah Abraham, has cautioned Senator Orji Kalu to stop intimidating people from the zone with his security aides.

Abraham spoke on the heels of Kalu’s recent outing to Arochukwu, where he was reportedly escorted by over 70 security personnel comprising army, police, DSS, civil defence, road safety officials and local vigilante boys.

Kalu represented his wife at a fundraising by Arochukwu women’s group last Saturday at Obinkita Arochukwu but the intimidating presence of security operatives in his company sparked outrage.

Worried by the development, Abraham said Kalu was only trying to instil fear in the people ahead of a possible supplementary poll between him and Senator Mao Ohuabunwa as ruled by the election petitions tribunal sitting in Umuahia.

Speaking with journalists in Umuahia, Abraham said, “What does Kalu intend to achieve by visiting Arochukwu with over 70 security personnel?”

But the media aide to Kalu, Mr Maduka Okoro, said Abraham was not present at the event and could not make any valid statement on what happened during the event.
