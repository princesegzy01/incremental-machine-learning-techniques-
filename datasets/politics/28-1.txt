Federal roads: Reps fault FG on refund
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The House of Representatives Committee on Federal Road Maintenance Agency has faulted the Federal Government for considering stoppage of refunds to states who repair federal roads.

Chairman of the House Committee in FERMA, Mr Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

Olufemi Bamisile, at the inaugural meeting of the panel on Wednesday, said he was disturbed by a statement credited to the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, that Federal Government would no longer entertain refund claims by state governors after fixing federal roads within their territory.

He said, “Does it mean that Nigerians will not get any value for the various taxes they pay? This committee must address this issue.”
