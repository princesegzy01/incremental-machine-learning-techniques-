Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, and Senator Smart Adeyemi, have jointly promised to ensure that the Kabba-Ayetoro Gbede-Ishanlu-Egbe-Ilorin Road is completed.

Bello, who made the promise during the Yagba Federal Constituency’s rally of the All Progressives Congress, said Adeyemi facilitated the rehabilitation of the road when he was in the National Assembly but it was abandoned when he left.

He urged the people of Kogi West to return him (Adeyemi) to the Senate to enable him to push for the completion of the road.

Bello said,“We are going to execute developmental projects that will impact positively on the lives of the people if we are given the mandate. We will also focus on youth empowerment and job creation to secure the future of our youth.”

Bello further urged the people of Kogi West to let their support for the APC translate into massive votes for the party and Adeyemi on November 16.

“Don’t throw away your votes. Give the votes to Adeyemi; he will represent you at the Senate effectively. If you love me and will cast your vote for me, do the same for Adeyemi,” he said.

Earlier, Adeyemi, who is also the Director-General, Bello/Onoja Campaign Council, said the senatorial district was ready to reward the governor with their votes for his “love for the zone.”
