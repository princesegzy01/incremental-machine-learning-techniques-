Appeal Court reserves judgment in Akinlade’s appeal against Abiodun
The Court of Appeal in Ibadan has reserved judgment in an appeal filed by Mr Adekunle Akinlade of the Allied People’s Movement against the victory of Governor Dapo Abiodun of the All Progressives Congress in the March 9 governorship election in Ogun State.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Akinlade appealed the September 4 judgment of the Election Petitions Tribunal in Abeokuta that upheld the victory of Abiodun as the Ogun State governor.

NAN reports that other respondents in the appeal are the APC and the Independent National Electoral Commission.

The five-man panel of the appeal court, presided over by Justice Abubakar Yahaya, reserved judgment after listening to the argument of all the parties.

Yahaya said the judgment day would be communicated to the counsel.

Earlier, the lead counsel for the APM, Mr Sebastine Hon (SAN), said Abiodun submitted a false academic qualification to aid his qualification to contest the 2019 governorship election.

Hon contented that there was a difference between what he wrote in the form CFO submitted in 2015 to contest the senatorial election and the one submitted in 2019 for governorship election.

In his argument, Abiodun’s counsel, Mr Taiwo Osipitan (SAN), said his client was qualified to contest the governorship election.

According to Osipitan, the issue of academic qualification is a pre-election matter, which ought to have been brought to court within 14 days after the document was submitted.
