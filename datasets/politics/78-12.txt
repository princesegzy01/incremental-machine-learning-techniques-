APC NWC meets ahead of Buhari meeting
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress met behind closed-doors on Tuesday in Abuja ahead of their Wednesday’s (today’s) meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.

The meeting which took place at the National Secretariat of the party and presided over by the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, was a prelude to the meeting with the President.

A source at the meeting said members reviewed ongoing activities in the party and drew up an agenda to be discussed with the President.

The NWC member said, “It is also feedback mechanism for the party and government and also offers the opportunity to chart a way forward for the progress of the country. So many issues will be discussed that we wouldn’t want to bother the public about.”

Clarifying the nature of the meeting, another NWC member said it was to further consolidate the smooth relationship between the party and the Presidency.

“The meeting could have been held at the APC National Secretariat and the President was willing to come but some other reasons made us to shift the venue back to Aso Rock Villa.”
