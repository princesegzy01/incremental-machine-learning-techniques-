Kogi CJ swears in Onoja as Deputy Governor
The Chief Judge of Kogi State, Justice Nadir Ajana on Monday swore in Mr Edward David Onoja as the Deputy Governor of the state

This follows his clearance by the House of Assembly after screening at the Assembly complex in Lokoja.

Onoja was sworn in by Chief Judge Ajana, assisted by the Grand Khadi of the state, Abdulkareem Aruwa and Governor Yahaya Bello

At the Assembly, the screening proceeding was presided over by the Speaker, Matthew Kolawole.

Speaking shortly before the swearing-in, Kolawole described the confirmation as the reward for loyalty exhibited by Onoja, while he was serving as the Chief of Staff to the governor.

He charged the new deputy governor to continue toeing the path of loyalty and hard work which earned him the elevation.

Speaking after the swearing-in, Governor Bello described the new deputy governor as a loyal and trusted friend, who has always demonstrated excellent ability even as his Chief of Staff

He said that he believed that the elevation will no doubt spur him (Onoja) to do more in the task of moving the state to the next level.

The state Assembly, last Friday, impeached Elder Simon Achuba as the deputy to Governor Yahaya Bello, shortly after receiving the report of the panel set up to investigate allegations of gross misconduct against the former deputy.

Achuba on Saturday declared his impeachment unconstitutional, saying that he will challenge it in court.

Onoja who recently resigned as the Chief of Staff to the Governor, is the running mate to Bello, in the November 16 state governorship election.
