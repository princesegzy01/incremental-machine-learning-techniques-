Osinbajo alleged cabals behind corruption allegations – Wale Oke
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The founder and Presiding Bishop of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries, Ibadan, Bishop Wale Oke, has said Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is not corrupt.

While receiving the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists, led by Jadesola Ajibola, at the Covenant Arena, his church in the Agodi area of Ibadan, Oke noted that when the news of the N90bn illegal funding went viral, some christian elders visited Osinbajo.

He said, “The VP did not only deny involving himself in any sleaze, but used the opportunity to inform us that some cabals were behind the allegations.”

The renowned cleric noted that Nigerians must learn to reward committed, loyal and patriotic citizens in a positive way and at the same time, expose people who were corrupt.

“The VP is always reaching out to Christian leaders on the need to support Buhari. Osinbajo is loyal to a fault.

“So, those plotting his downfall through orchestrated campaigns should fear God. This man is not corrupt. He has been a friend for many years,” he added.
