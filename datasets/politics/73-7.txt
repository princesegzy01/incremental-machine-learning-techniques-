It’s unfair to deny South-West presidency in 2023 – Shehu Sani
Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

A former lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Senator Shehu Sani, on Monday, said it would be unfair to deny the South-West geopolitical zone the presidency in 2023.

Sani, a member of the 8th Senate, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to caution any politician of northern extraction against eyeing the presidency in 2023.

Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, had made a case for the abandonment of zoning arrangements for political offices as currently obtained in the country.

El-Rufai had said the arrangement needed to be de-emphasised and abandoned in favour of competence.

However, Sani kicked against jettisoning the zoning arrangement.

Speaking with journalists in Kaduna on Monday, the former lawmaker argued that it would be unfair for the North after eight years to hold on to power beyond 2023.

He said, “It will be a serious threat to the future and peace of the country if the northern region continues to dominate the leadership of the nation because of its numerical strength.

“The President should caution those from the North eyeing that position. Power needs to rotate to other regions. The South-West worked tirelessly to remove the PDP from office and helped to bring Nigeria to where it is today and deserves support from the North come 2023.”

“If federal character is applied on appointments and other areas, it should also be applicable in the political space.”
