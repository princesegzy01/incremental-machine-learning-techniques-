Alaafin’s advice gave us victory –Makinde
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, on Tuesday, said one of the secrets of his electoral success at the 2019 governorship election was the advice offered him by the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, during his 2015 campaign.

Makinde spoke at the Alaafin’s palace when he paid a working visit to the monarch, before touring the multi-million naira Ajila Value Adding Ventures Limited, Awe, comprising large modern poultry farm; hatchery; palm plantation and processing plant, as well as renewable energy resources.

The governor, who said he had visited the Alaafin in 2015 to seek his support and blessings ahead of the polls, said it was only the Alaafin who told him the truth about the situation on the ground and offered him advice on how to go about it.

He said, “During my campaign in 2015, it was only the Alaafin that told me the truth on how we have been doing and how we were not doing things right.

“All he told us were put to use in the 2019 elections that gave us victory.

“We are here to inspect projects on how our economy can improve and I am sure that when we finish the project, Oyo town will also know it for good.

“The facility will help our farmers to have good storage facility for the farm produce which will moderate practices especially prices when the need arises,” he said.
