I’ll still be active in Oyo politics – Ladoja
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

A former Oyo State governor, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, has said he would not stay idle when developmental issues are being deprived the masses of the state

Ladoja, who spoke to journalists in Ibadan on Monday, dispelled insinuations that he had quit politics.

He described the news of his abandoning politics as “a needless and unsubstantiated material fed to the unsuspecting public.”

The former governor wondered why his statement, prior to the 2019 elections, that he would not contest the governorship election, was twisted, many months after.

The Osi Olubadan said, “Is it possible for someone to retire from politics? Are you not a politician? So, what are they talking about? All I said was that I was not contesting again. Is that retirement? That is not retirement.

“I said that I was not contesting again but I would always go for developmental politics whether I was in partisan or non-partisan politics.

“If there are any developmental politics, I will always go for it anywhere in Nigeria. So, it is not a question of ‘siddon -look’, I will still be active politically,” Ladoja added.
