Senate may not reconvene over Edo court order – Spokesman
Sunday Aborisade, Abuja

The Senate on Sunday said it may not recall its members who were on annual recess to discuss the latest development on the Edo State House of Assembly crisis.

The upper chamber had last Tuesday given a one- week ultimatum to the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, to issue a fresh proclamation letter for the proper inauguration of the 7th Edo Assembly or risk the takeover of the parliament by the National Assembly.

The state government, however, got an injunction on Friday which restrained the Senate from going ahead with the implementation of its resolution pending the determination of the case filed before it on the issue.

The Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Adedayo Adeyeye, told our correspondent on Sunday that the latest development did not warrant any urgent need to reconvene in order to review the one-week ultimatum, which expires on Tuesday (tomorrow).

Adeyeye noted that the Edo Assembly crisis was very important and a threat to democracy but that it was not an urgent matter that could not wait till the lawmakers would resume next month.

He said, “The leadership of the Senate will review the issue at the end of the one- week ultimatum issued to the Edo State Governor in view of the court order, which I am not sure we have been served anyway.

“We were mindful of the fact that we were going on recess when we issued that ultimatum. However, I see no reason for any hurried reconvening simply for that matter since we are resuming next month.”
