Tribunal sacks Kaduna PDP lawmaker, orders re-run
Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

The National and State House of Assembly Tribunal sitting in Kaduna, on Saturday ordered a re-run in 22 polling units within two wards in Kagarko Constituency of the state.

This followed the tribunal’s verdict sacking Mr Morondia Tanko of the Peoples Democratic Party in the March 9 election into the Kagarko State Consistency.

Tanko was declared winner of that poll but a former deputy speaker of the State Assembly, and candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Mr. Nuhu Shadalafiya, challenged the victory of the PDP’s candidate and his party at the Tribunal.

The three-member panel chaired by Justice Suleiman, in a unanimous judgement ordered a re-run in the affected wards and polling units.

According to the judgment read by Justice Habiba Abubakar, the respondent failed to prove his case beyond reasonable doubts that he did not commit the malpractices petitioned against him.

She, however, said the petitioner had proved beyond reasonable doubts that all the electoral malpractices he challenged, were committed.

Justice Abubakar said, “That there should be a re- run in two wards, polling unit 001 to polling unit 018.”
