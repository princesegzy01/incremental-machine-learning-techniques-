Friday Olokor, Abuja

About 123 political parties contested the primaries for the governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states scheduled for November 16.

The Independent National Electoral Commission stated this in its reports on the primaries released on Wednesday.

According to the report, 64 parties conducted primaries that were monitored by INEC in Bayelsa State with seven females emerging victorious.

But in Kogi States 59 parties conducted primaries that were monitored and which produced four females among the candidates.

INEC’s Director of Voter Education and Publicity, Oluwole Osaze Uzzi, said the lists were not the list of candidates contesting the respective governorship elections.

He said, “These are the results of the political party primaries monitored by the commission. Some parties may chose, for whatever reason, not to sponsor any candidate even after conducting primaries.

“It is all in our resolve as a commission to proactively disclose information to the media and the public. We have not previously officially published the result of our monitoring.”

The All Progressives Congress has incumbent Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State who is seeking a second term as its flag bearer, while Wada Musa was listed to fly the flag of the Peoples Democratic Party.

But in Bayelsa State, the APC had David Lyon as winner of the primary, while the PDP listed Senator Douye Diri as winner of the party primary, even as seven women were also listed as winning their respective party primaries.
