Court stops Lagos PDP election
Mudiaga Affe

A Lagos State High Court on Tuesday restrained the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party from conducting elections into the executive positions of the state chapter of the party.

The NWC on November 5 constituted a special election committee led by Senator Ben Obi to conduct elections for new executive officers to fill in some vacant positions in the Lagos State chapter of the party on November 13 (today).

But the state party chairman, Dr Dominic Adegbola and seven others, whose positions were listed as vacant, dragged the national PDP and the committee to court to stop the election.

In the suit, No LD/3600GCM/19, Justice T.A.O. Oyekan-Abdullai ordered that the proposed election slated for November 13 neither had no input of the state executive nor was it in compliance with the party constitution.
