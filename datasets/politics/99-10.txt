President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has congratulated the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, on his victory at the Supreme Court on Friday.

He urged him to be magnanimous in victory.

Lawan, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mohammed Isa, on Friday, described the judgement as victory for democracy, the All Progressive Congress, the Governor and the people of Osun State.

He charged Oyetola to put the litigation behind him and concentrate on tackling the challenges facing the state.

He urged him to run an all-inclusive government where everybody in the state would be carried along for the good of the state.

Lawan said, “Your victory is a great joy and achievement to our party. We are delighted that after a long legal battle, Osun State can finally settle down for good governance.

“My advice to you as you champion the course of governance in the state is to see every indigene of the state as equal partner and stakeholder in driving the wheel of progress.

“Let your reign be exceptional by being magnanimous and focussed.”

The President of the Senate called on the people of the state to give maximum support and cooperation to the governor in the interest and progress of the state.

“Now that the legal battle is over, let us come together and embrace one another in the general interest of the State,” he said.
