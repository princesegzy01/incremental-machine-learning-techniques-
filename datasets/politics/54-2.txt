Bayelsa poll: Dickson calls for tolerance
Oladimeji Ramon

Ahead of the November 16, 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State, Governor Seriake Dickson has called for maturity and tolerance among the contesting political parties and candidates.

Dickson appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure a free, fair and credible election.

The governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, on Thursday, made the appeal during a “monthly praise night.”

According to the statement, Dickson commended the spirit of sportsmanship displayed by the 21 Peoples Democratic Party governorship aspirants, who contested in the party’s primary.

He, however, described the primary of the opposition All Progressives Congress that produced Chief David Lyon as a sham.

“That is an imposition, my dear friends; let’s call it by its proper name, an imposition.

“What has happened on the other side is an imposition and I want to sympathise with all the very qualified people who offered themselves for service but have been rudely and crudely shut out and down in the most criminal manner and in all of these to produce a small, toothless lion,” Dickson said.
