Bayelsa stakeholders urge fairness in PDP aspirants’ screening
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

Stakeholders in Bayelsa State on Tuesday appealed to the Peoples Democratic Party to adopt the principle of fairness in screening aspirants for the governorship primaries of the party scheduled for September 3.

The stakeholders, under the auspices of the PDP Action Group, said the party must apply decorum and absolute fairness in the entire process to make it have universal acceptance.

The group, in a statement in Yenagoa by its President, Preye Ekeigha, said any plot to abandon fairness would send a wrong signal and cause chaos.

Ekeigha said, “It is in this light that we admonish the screening committee to ensure due diligence and ensure that none is deliberately screened out to satisfy interest at the detriment of our great party.

“Our party must understand that as we begin the process of having a free, fair and standardised primary that will have universal acceptance, we must tread with decorum and absolute fairness in our conduct.”
