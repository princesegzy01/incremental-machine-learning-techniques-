Religious leaders task INEC, others on peaceful election
religious leaders in Kogi State have advised the Independent National Electoral Commission, security agencies and the state government to create an enabling environment for the peaceful conduct of the governorship election holding on November 16.

The religious leaders gave the advice in Lokoja on Tuesday during a seminar organised by the state chapters of the Christian Association of Nigeria and the Jamatul Nasril Islam for their members on the forthcoming election.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the theme of the seminar is, ‘The Fear of God as Panacea To A Peaceful and Transparent Election.’

The religious leaders called on INEC, the police and the state government to let the fear of God guides their actions before and after the election.

The state chairman of CAN, John Ibenu, in his paper, described the fear of God as the most important to mankind, saying without it, one could not be upright.

Also delivering a paper on the same topic, an Islamic scholar, Alhaji Isman Taidi, called on INEC to conduct a free, fair and acceptable election that would meet the people’s expectations.

He also called on security agencies, especially the police, to put their acts together by providing adequate security throughout the process.

The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof. James Apam, explained that delivering a transparent, fair and credible election was a shared responsibility of all stakeholders.
