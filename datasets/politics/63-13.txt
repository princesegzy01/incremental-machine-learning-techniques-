Isoko chiefs back Omo-Agege as Delta APC leader
Sunday Aborisade, Abuja

The All Progressives Congress ward leaders in the Isoko North and South local government areas have passed a vote of confidence in the Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, as the leader of the party in Delta State.

They said any attempt to whip up sentiments against him and the Delta State APC chairman, Jones Erue, would fail.

The Isoko APC leaders stated this at their emergency meeting in Oleh, Delta State, on Sunday, stressing that the two party leaders could transform more lives at the grass roots.

A communiqué signed by Irorobona Ozomaro, on behalf of the Isoko APC ward leaders, also warned some individuals inciting members against the leaders to stop such action or face the wrath of the people.

The communiqué said there were deliberate attempts by some individuals to cause frictions between the Isoko and the Urhobo people by demeaning the two political leaders.

It expressed anger over undue allegations being made against Omo-Agege and Erue over the vacant position of the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission.

The communiqué read in part, “The leaders passed a vote of explicit confidence in Senator Ovie Omo-Agege and Chairman, APC Delta State, Jones Erue, because we are satisfied with their leadership posture and belief.”
