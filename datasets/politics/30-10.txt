Gbenga Odogun,Lokoja

The erstwhile running mate to late Abubakar Audu says he has finally agreed to support the re-election bid of Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, in the November governorship election.

Faleke who responded to our correspondent’s question, said, “Following the decision of the leadership of Audu/Faleke group to work with the governor, on behalf of the group, I met with the governor to chart the way forward and build a strong All Progressives Congress before the election.

“We have put all issues in the past and now, we will be in a better position to always assist and advise the party and government in the state to execute people friendly programmes.”

Faleke said although he presently had no vote in Kogi, he had numerous followers in the state.

“It is necessary to bring party faithful who have being with me to the governor so that we will have a strong voice which will be seen in the outcome of the election,” he added.
