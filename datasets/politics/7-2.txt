Kogi election: PDP accuses Bello, Adeyemi of plotting Melaye’s arrest
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The Peoples Democratic Party has accused the Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, and his campaign’s Director-General, Smart Adeyemi, of allegedly plotting the arrest and detention of Dino Melaye before the November 16 elections.

The party said the plot was allegedly hatched on Monday during a meeting at the Government House.

A statement by Melaye’s media aide, Gideon Ayodele, on Tuesday said the governor and Adeyemi with some other All Progressives Congress’ stakeholders in the state had concluded arrangement to ensure that he (Melaye) was arrested and detained before the elections.

The statement read, “The Peoples Democratic Party has called on the people of Kogi West Senatorial District and Kogi electorates to resist any attempt to rob them of their right in choosing candidates of their choice in the elections.”

The governor’s Director-General, Media and Publicity, Kingsley Fanwo, said it was not the governor’s responsibility to arrest offenders.

He said, “The governor is not interested in arresting anyone, not even Dino because there is no need for that. He has lost the election because he is not campaigning since he has nothing to tell the people.”
