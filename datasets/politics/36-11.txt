The Director-General of the Peoples Democratic Party’s campaign organisation for the November 16 governorship poll in Kogi State, T.J. Yusuf, has called on the people to vote for the candidate of the PDP, Musa Wada.

Yusuf made the call in a statement on Friday by

Head, Communications and Strategy, Musa/Aro Campaign Organisation, Faruq Adejo.

He said, “The long, tortuous four years of hunger, poverty, violence, collapsed public infrastructure and services, insecurity and violence is coming to an end.

“Happy days are coming again.”

He said the PDP would declare a state of emergency in education, health, agriculture and rural and urban development if elected.

Yusuf decried water scarcity in Lokoja and other parts of the state, adding that his party would provide water if elected.

He said, “It’s worrisome that after collecting close to N400bn in less than four years, the present government has not only failed to embarked on any project that will improve the lives of the people, but its abandoning functional critical infrastructure inherited from the PDP administration to rot away.”
