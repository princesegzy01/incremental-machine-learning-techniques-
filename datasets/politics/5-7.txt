Appeal court affirms Orji Kalu’s victory
Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

An Appeal Court in Owerri, Imo State, on Thursday, affirmed Oji Kalu as the rightful winner of the February 23 election in the Abia North Senatorial District.

The Chairman of the panel, R.A. Ada, who read a unanimous decision, flayed the lower court for ordering a rerun in some electoral wards in Abia North.

The jurist said the premise on which the election petitions tribunal cancelled Orji’s victory was unknown to law.

He contended that the lower court granted the petitioner reliefs it did not ask, “which is unacceptable in law.”

The justice said the petitioner, Mao Ohuabunwa, tendered his documents at the lower tribunal without calling witnesses to tie the documents to their case.

He said, “The lower court erred by allowing the dumping of documents on the lower tribunal. In law, the petitioner must establish proof by bringing witnesses who will tie the documents to the substance of the case.”
