PDP tackles Oshiomhole over arms stockpile comment
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Peoples Democratic Party in Bayelsa State has condemned the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, for making “wild and miserable fabrications” of arms stockpile against the PDP in the state.

The state Chairman of the PDP, Moses Cleopas, said in a statement on Sunday that Oshiomhole and other leaders of the APC were making the allegations as a ploy to justify a plot to deploy soldiers to rig the governorship election in the state.

Cleopas said, “The people of Bayelsa will resist any attempt by the APC to deploy soldiers to rig the governorship poll.”

He called on Nigerians to ignore the APC allegation which, according to him, were inspired by the desperation of the party to cause mischief.
