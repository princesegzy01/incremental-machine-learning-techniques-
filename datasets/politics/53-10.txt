Banditry: Masari threatens to sanction traditional rulers
Olaide Oyelude, Katsina

Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State on Thursday threatened that he would sanction any traditional ruler or transition committee chairman found to be supporting bandits.

He gave the warning in Ungwar Tsamiya village, in the Faskari Local Government Area of the state during another round of dialogue with self-repented bandits and Fulani leaders.

Masari told the gathering that Katsina State had a reputation for being a state of harmony, warning that he was not ready to allow avoidable security challenges to tarnish the reputation.

He said, “As a government we swore to protect the welfare, lives and property of our citizens, we cannot allow this avoidable loss to continue. If traditional and religious leaders play their role well, this problem will end.

“So, traditional rulers, district and village heads should listen. I swear, if we find any of you aiding the activities of these miscreants, that person will be sanctioned.”

The Transition Committee Chairman of the Faskari LGA, Mr Musa Ado, suggested that Masari should synergize with his Zamfara State counterpart to stop the bandits from carrying out attacks on the villages in the council and in other parts of Katsina State.
