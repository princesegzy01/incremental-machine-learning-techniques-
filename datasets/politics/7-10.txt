Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The Commissioner of Police in charge of Kogi State, Hakeem Busari, has called on the people of the state not to be afraid of coming out to exercise their rights during the elections in the state.

The commissioner spoke on Tuesday while receiving participants of media peace day rally organised by the Kogi State Council of the Nigerian Union of Journalists in collaboration with Search for Common Ground, a non-governmental organisation preaching peace.

He said with the security arrangement being put in place by the police, there would be no reason to entertain any fear.

Busari said, “We have enough personnel and other security agencies are ready to collaborate with us on that day to give necessary assurance to the people.

“The Inspector-General of Police has provided us with additional policemen to man the polling stations so that everybody will be able to come out and exercise their franchise without any fear of molestation.”

Also, the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof. James Apam, assured residents of the commission’s readiness to conduct credible elections that would be acceptable to all.
