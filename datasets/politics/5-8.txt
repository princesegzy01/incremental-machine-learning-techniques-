A’Court upholds Okorocha’s election
Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

An Appeal Court in Owerri on Thursday upheld the electoral victory of Senator Rochas Okorocha of the Imo West Senatorial District.

The chairman of the panel, R.A. Ada, who read the judgment, said the appeals filed by Senator Osita Izunaso of the All Progressive Grand Alliance and Jones Onyereri of the Peoples Democratic Party against Okorocha lacked merit.

The jurist contended that the judgment of the election tribunal which upheld Okorocha’s election, was in order.

The panel said the petitioners could not prove their allegations of violence, over-voting, mutilation of electoral results and hijacking of electoral officers.

Okorocha had on February 23 defeated Onyereri and Izunaso but the returning officer alleged that he declared Okorocha winner under duress.
