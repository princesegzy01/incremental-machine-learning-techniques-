N6.3bn fraud: EFCC seeks amended charge against Jang
James Abraham, Jos

A Plateau State High Court sitting in Jos on Monday fixed October 10 for hearing on a fresh application filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission seeking to amend an earlier charge it filed against the former governor of Plateau State, Senator Jonah Jang.

Jang was charged alongside a former cashier in the Office of the Secretary to the Plateau State Government, Mr Yusuf Pam, with 13 counts bordering on an alleged N6.3bn fraud which was allegedly committed before the end of his tenure in 2015.

The anti-graft agency had called 12 witnesses since the accused were arraigned before Justice Daniel Longji in March 2018.

The former governor and his co-accused, had, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge and were granted bail.

At the resumed hearing of the case in Jos on Monday, EFCC counsel, Mr Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), informed the court of the intention to amend the earlier charge which it filled against the former governor from 13 to 17.

The senior lawyer, however, said the EFCC would not call additional witnesses after calling the last witness, Mrs Mary Bawa, a former director of Finance and Supply with the State Universal Primary Education Board, who testified in court on Monday as the PW 12 .

In response, Jangâ€™s counsel, Mr Mike Ozekhome, (SAN), who was represented by Mr Edward Pwajok (SAN), acknoweldeged the receipt of the EFCC application to amend the 13 counts against his client.
