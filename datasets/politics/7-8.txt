Kogi: Court adjourns Abubakar, Wada case till after election
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

A high court sitting in Lokoja on Tuesday adjourned a case seeking to disqualify the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Musa Wada, from contesting the November 16 governorship election to November 27.

Abubakar Idris, the son of a former governor of the state, had dragged Wada, who is his brother-in-law, to court on the grounds that he was not properly elected at the party’s primary and therefore urged the court to disqualify him and declare him (Abubakar) the winner of the party’s primary.

The court had adjourned the case last Friday till Tuesday.

When the case came up for defence, counsel for the first defendant (PDP), Kola Olowookere, told the court that the former counsel handling the case was indisposed and that he needed time to study the records of proceedings.

But counsel for Abubakar Idris, Mr. Rowland Otaru (SAN), objected to the plea for adjournment, saying the counsel for the first defendant (PDP) did not need any extra time to study a case, which had reached the defence level.

Counsel for the second defendant (Wada), Prof Joas Amupitan, SAN, while supporting the plea for adjournment, told the trial court not to allow anybody to stampede the court in arriving at a decision that was not fair to all the parties.

Justice Richard Olorunfemi, while accepting the plea for adjournment, said the court must not be made to proceed at a “neck-breaking speed” when there was still much time to hear all sides of the case .

He therefore adjourned the case to November 27 for defence.
