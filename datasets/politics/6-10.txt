Democratically elected LGs will emerge in 2020 –Makinde
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, said he was set to institutionalise the democratically elected local government system at the grass roots.

Makinde, who spoke while inaugurating the boards of the Local Government Service Commission; the Post-Primary Teaching Service Commission and the state Universal Basic Education Board, said his government would turn local governments to real centres of development.

The governor also noted that the state would focus on infrastructure of the schools in view of the influx of pupils from private schools due to the free education policy of the state.

He added, “There is no doubting the fact that the three commissions hit directly at the people, whom we crave to serve diligently.

“Education is one of the four key pillars of our service delivery agenda and you will agree with me that action or inaction of TESCOM and SUBEB have implications for our success in the area of education, where we have since declared a free and qualitative education policy.”

He stated that to institutionalise democratically elected government at the grass roots, his government would conduct free, fair and credible local government election in 2020.

Makinde said, “The LGSC is to drive our bid to turn the councils to real centres of development, rather than glorified power centres they have been turned to in the past years.”
