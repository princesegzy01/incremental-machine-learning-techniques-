The second Cross River State Election Petitions Tribunal presided over by Justices A. A. Babawale, S. B. Shuaibu and M. C. Okoh, will on Thursday deliver judgment on five of the cases before it.

Another suit with number EPT/CAL/HR/06/2019 is between Jude Ngaji of the APC and Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe of PDP.

There is also the House of Representatives petition between Mkpanam Obo-Bassey Ekpo of the APC and Daniel Asuquo of the PDP, and another between Akiba Bassey Ekpenyong of the APC and Eta Mbora of the PDP.

The other House of Representatives petition to be decided is between Dominic Aqua Edem of the APC and Essien Ayi of the PDP.

Judgment in the governorship and state House of Assembly elections of March 9, 2019 is expected to be delivered not later than September 25, which is the deadline for the conclusion of the matters.
