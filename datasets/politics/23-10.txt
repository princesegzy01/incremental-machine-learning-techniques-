The Chairman of Coalition of Registered Political Parties, Edo State, Dr Samson Isibor, on Tuesday, described as illegal the sacking of local government chairmen in the state.

Governor Godwin Obaseki had sacked four council chairmen, Eghe Ogbemudia (Egor), Patrick Aguinede, (Esan West), Yakson Musa (Etsako West), and Aremiyau Momoh (Etsako East), all council political appointees and about 300 senior special advisers and special advisers of the state government.

In his speech at the CRPP 2019 Award of Excellence ceremony, Isibor condemned the use of thugs and hoodlums on opponents, describing the development as worrisome.

He said, “The sacking of elected local government chairmen, which is not in the powers of the governor, is illegal, so he should recall them because we see it as a political vendetta, intimidation and harassment of the opponents, particularly in the APC.

“We, the political parties, want peace in our state. We don’t want any sort of killing or maiming; we want development, which has eluded us for the past three years.

He implored the governor to make peace with his party and allow development to take place.
