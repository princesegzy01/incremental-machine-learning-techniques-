AbdulRazaq urges support for reforms in Kwara
Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State on Monday urged the people of the state to support his agenda for reforms and paradigm shift in governance.

Speaking at the 2nd Annual Grand Durbar ceremony organised by the Ilorin Emirate Council, AbdulRazaq said the people’s resolve for a new dawn meant a need to eschew actions or inaction that had made growth difficult in the past.

The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Kayode Alabi, said, “We must embrace reforms which are often tough at the beginning. We must make tough choices in our decision to move our state forward.

“Public resources will only be applied strictly to public projects and overheads approved and budgeted for. We will not entertain excesses of any sort. With people’s interest as the guiding principle, we will do things differently and purposefully to get more impactful results.

“I appeal to this distinguished gathering to unite behind this agenda for the progress. Anything short of this will keep us moving in a circle.”

The governor said prudent management of resources was necessary to drive growth.

The Emir of Ilorin, Dr Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, thanked all the guests and gave the chieftaincy title of Danmazani of Ilorin to the Durbar Committee Chairman, Suleiman Yahaya Alapansanpa.
