Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin

The Kwara State House of Assembly has called on the Federal Road Safety Corps and other security agencies to extend their areas of coverage and hours of operation to check carnage during the forthcoming Eld el- Kabir festival.

The appeal was made on Tuesday during the Assembly plenary following a Matter of General Public Importance on “ The Need for Safe Driving During Sallah Festival” raised by the member representing Ojomu/Balogun Constituency, Hon Saheed Popoola and seconded by member representing Ilorin East Constituency, Hon Jimoh Aliyu Yusuf.

The House, which equally called for more sensitisation on safety measures by broadcast stations as a matter of social responsibility, enjoined Transport Unions to be alive to their responsibilities of monitoring the activities of their members during the sallah period to reduce road carnage.

Popoola had while raising the matter, observed that casualties usually characterised festive periods, occasioned by excessive speeding, among others.

Other members who spoke on the matter called for moderate eid el Kabir celebrations, pointing out that the period should be used for sober reflection on virtues of sacrifice, piety and love for one another to further enhance peace and progress of the country.

Meanwhile, the Assembly also approved the request of the State Governor, Alhaji Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to appoint seven Special Advisers to ease governance and dividends of democracy in the state.
