Kogi poll: APC crisis deepens as stakeholders sue NWC
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

Some stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress in Kogi State have sued the National Working Committee of the party for adopting indirect primary for the nomination of its candidate in the August 29 primary.

In the originating summons filed on Friday by their lawyer, Oluwole Aladedoye, at the Federal High Court in Abuja, the plaintiffs are asking the court to halt the indirect primary proposed in the primary by the NWC.

The plaintiffs, who are members of Haddy Ametuo-led faction, are the Ex-officio, Mr Destiny Aromeh; Organising Secretary, Mr Isah Abubakar; Zonal Youth Leader, Mr Noah Aku, and Zonal Women Leader, Mrs Joy Onu.

Recall that Ametuo had withdrawn from the case earlier filed by the faction against the state executive committee chaired by Abdullahi Bello and loyal to Governor Yahya Bello.

The case pending before Justice Okon Abang of an Abuja Federal High Court is to determine which faction of the party is the genuine executive body.

The stakeholders in the notification of the suit sent to the National Legal Adviser, Babatunde Ogala, prayed him to advise the party on the need to respect court processes and halt any action on the proposed indirect mode of primary.

Among issues formulated for determination are whether having regard to the pendency of suit filed by Haddy Ametuo, Salam Adejoh (suing for themselves and on behalf of other members) of the SEC elected on May 19, 2018, the APC could adopt the indirect primary mode.
