I won’t support aspirants outside Restoration Caucus – Dickson
Oladimeji Ramon

Ahead of the governorship primary of the Peoples Democratic Party in Bayelsa State, Governor Seriake Dickson has said he will not support any candidate outside the Restoration Caucus.

He said it was the Restoration Caucus of the PDP in Bayelsa State that would determine the PDP governorship candidate for the September 3 poll.

A statement by his Special Adviser, Media Relations, Fidelis Soriwei, quoted the governor to have said this on Monday at the Government House in Yenagoa, during the inauguration of the Restoration Governorship Primary Election Committee.

Dickson said he was not ready to bear the moral burden of supporting any aspirant who did not belong to the Restoration Caucus of the PDP.

He said, “We have agreed to elect a candidate for our party from the Restoration Team. I will fail in my responsibilities and values if I abandon those who have supported me, who have been through the thick and thin with me.”
