Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has said persons in authority face temptations and should be prayed for always to enable them to take the right decisions.

Okowa stated this on Sunday at a thanksgiving service in honour of Mr Guwor Dennis, the member representing Warri South-West Constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly.

He said, “Pray for us always because when you are in political position, you face all manner of situations but with God the right decisions that will benefit the people will be implemented.

“There is nothing that God cannot do, the Lord is the master of every situation and as individuals and as a government, we will continue to acknowledge the role of God in our lives.

“Being the first Ijaw man from Warri South-West to be a member of the Delta State House of Assembly, I am glad that you (Hon. Guwor) recognise that your victory came from God; men who recognise God in their lives never go down.”

Earlier, Pastor Olufemi Olumide of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Effurun, Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State said in a sermon that thanksgiving was the expression of gratitude to God.
