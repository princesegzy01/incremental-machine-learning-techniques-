He warned that any group or persons trying to manipulate the election would face the full wrath of the law.

“We are more than ready to face the election;we are going into this election to win.

“Anybody that attempt to change what people have chosen through the ballot by any form of manipulation, is a criminal and the place reserved for criminals is prison,” Abdullahi said.
