The governor, who described the judgment as a welcome development and a reaffirmation of the people’s mandate, said the development would further ginger him to action.

“The judgment of the election tribunal upholding my election and the Peoples Democratic Party is a reaffirmation of the people’s mandate and an added impetus to my drive to make Adamawa work again,“ Fintiri said.

The governor lauded the tribunal for being upright and just and thanked the entire citizens of the state for support and prayer.

He restated his resolve to work for the good of the people of Adamawa State, adding that he would not let them down.
