Kogi elections: Indiscriminate court orders slow down our job —INEC
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The Independent National Electoral Commission has expressed concerns over indiscriminate court orders affecting its job.

INEC’s National Commissioner and Chairman, Voter Education and Publicity, Festus Okoye expressed the concerns on Wednesday while speaking at a media parley in Lokoja ahead of Saturday’s elections in Kogi State.

Okoye said even though the commission has resolved to obey every court order relating to the conduct of an election, it has become a source of worry as such orders often slow down the job of the commission.

“For instance when a court gives an order 48 hours to an election, which must be obeyed, it means the commission will have to put in extra effort to meet the deadline.”

Barrister Okoye called for dialogue on the extent to which it can exercise its power guaranteed by the constitution and electoral laws.

He said that the commission will embark on presentation of robust proposals on electoral reforms to the national assembly next year.

“We will be bold, strong and courageous in our efforts to get our electoral system reformed so that our country can enjoy the full benefits of democracy.” He added.

Okoye also called for proper scrutiny of politicians.
