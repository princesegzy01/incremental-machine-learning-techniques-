Bayesla poll: PDP youths deny Dickson, Sylva meeting
Daniels Igoni

The Peoples Democratic Party Youth Network in Bayelsa State has dismissed a purported meeting between the state governor Seriake Dickson and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva.

In a statement on Saturday, the Secretary-General of the PDPYN, Mr James Oputin, described the rumoured meeting involving Dickson and Sylva as the figment of the imagination of some people.

According to Oputin, the politicians behind the rumour are scared of the “growing internal cohesion within the PDP” ahead of the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state.

He said that the “false story” was designed to malign the leadership of the PDP in the state and put doubts in the minds of the party’s supporters.

Oputin said Dickson and the PDP did not need the support of leaders of the All Progressives Congress such as Sylva to win the poll.

The PDPYN scribe said the party would not be distracted by “disgruntled characters of the APC who are battling to divert attention from the challenge of marketing a gubernatorial misnomer as their candidate in Bayelsa.”
