‘Bayelsa gov poll has been lost, won’
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

Governor Seriake Dickson has predicted that the Bayelsa State governorship election scheduled for Saturday will be “won by the Peoples Democratic Party and lost by the All Progressives Congress.”

Dickson, who stated this during a live media chat in Yenagoa, said his confidence was based on the crowd that thronged the campaign venues of the PDP across the constituencies.

The governor stated that the dominance of the PDP in Bayelsa politics was not under any threat from the APC.

He gave a thumbs up to the “exceptional performance” of his administration in enthroning a “tolerant political culture” that treated all politicians, including the opposition, with respect.

Dickson said his restoration government had made history for providing an enabling environment for all political parties to campaign round the state without any breach of the peace.

He added that the campaigns of the various political parties had been smooth without any incident of violence and killings because of the policy of years of sustained investment in security by the government.

Dickson said, “Few days to a governorship election, for the first time, we are seeing a Bayelsa that is calm. There are no explosions, no major security breaches, no hoodlums threatening people. Even though some of the APC rallies in Yenagoa have been characterised by a lot of brigandage, it’s nothing compared to the past.”

He urged the people of Bayelsa to cast their votes for Senator Douye Diri and Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo in order to sustain the prevailing peace, stability and other enduring legacies of his administration.
