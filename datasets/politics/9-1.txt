PDP tasks security agencies on peaceful elections
Success Nwogu, Abuja

The Peoples Democratic Party has urged security agencies to prevent violence before, during and after the November 16 governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states.

The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja on Monday, stated that loss of lives and destruction of property because of election were unnecessary.

He urged security agencies to support the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure free, fair, credible and transparent elections in the two states.

Ologbondiyan said, “Security agencies must help to reshape our politics. It is unnecessary to allow anybody to die just because of election.

“In advanced democracy, it is never like that. We believe that the security agencies have a huge responsibility to support INEC in providing an environment for peaceful election. They must ensure that there is no violence and loss of life.”

Meanwhile, the PDP South-South Youth Vanguard has cautioned against violence before, during and after the governorship election, in Bayelsa State.

The National Chairman of the group, Mr James Akpofure, in a statement said the group would not support any act of violence or any group planning to cause trouble in the state.
