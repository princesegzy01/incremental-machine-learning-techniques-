Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The All Progressives Congress has yet to issue a directive on the replacement for the Deputy National Chairman (South), Otunba Niyi Adebayo, The PUNCH has learnt.

Adebayo, the first Executive Governor of Ekiti State, was recently sworn in as the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment by President Muhammadu Buhari.

He is occupying the position zoned to Ekiti State for the South West region of the country.

The position of the National Secretary of the party formerly occupied by the Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, is also presently vacant with the Deputy National Secretary, Victor Giadom, from Rivers State appointed in an acting capacity.

A source in the party said no request for replacement had been presented to the party at the state because of the need for consultation.
