The Independent National Electoral Commission has assured the physically-challenged persons in Bayelsa State that they will vote during the governorship election in the state.

The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Monday Udoh, gave the assurance during a one-day training in voter education and sign language interpretation organised by INEC in Yenagoa on Wednesday.

He said the participation of people with disabilities in the electoral process was an underlining principle of the United Nations Convention on rights of physically challenged persons which was adopted in 2006.

Udoh said in recognition of the human rights of persons with disabilities, INEC would do everything possible within its mandate to ensure their inclusion in the electoral process.

“The objective is to train civil society organisations and persons to carry out voter education at the grass roots for the governorship election,” the Bayelsa REC said.

Also speaking, the Deputy Director, CSOs Division at INEC, Abuja, Mrs Lakunuya Dorothy-Bello, said the commission was committed to not only conducting free, fair and credible election but also an inclusive election.

She said the introduction of the voter education and sensitisation forum for sign language interpreters in the electoral process was to create awareness for those with hearing impairment on polling unit procedure.
