The Imo State Government says it will soon commence preparations for the conduct of elections into the 27 local government councils of the state.

The Governor, Emeka Ihedioha, stated this in Owerri on Tuesday.

He said he would soon get in touch with the officials of the state’s Independent Electoral Commission to ascertain their level of preparedness for the conduct of the polls.

He said, “My administration has since embarked on devolution of power to the local government councils and in no distant time, eligible voters will go to the polls for free and fair elections.

“I will soon meet with the officials of the ISIEC to appraise how far they have prepared for the council election.”

The governor restated his determination to restore the state’s education sector to its former pride of place as the biggest industry in the state.
