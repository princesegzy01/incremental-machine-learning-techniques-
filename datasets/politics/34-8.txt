APC raises 18-member peace panel for Bayelsa
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

The All Progressives Congress has raised an 18-member peace committee to reconcile aggrieved members after the September 4 governorship primary.

The Bayelsa APC governorship primary headed by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, had declared David Lyon as the winner of the primary.

Dissatisfied with the decision, the immediate past Minister of State for Agriculture, Heineken Lolpobiri, and a founding member, Peter Aganaba, among others had approached the court seeking the nullification of the primary.

The 18-member committee chaired by a former Chief of Staff to Governor Seriake Dickson, Chief Diekivie Ikiogha, is to reconcile aggrieved members and convince them to work for the party among other responsibilities.

The Bayelsa APC Chairman, Jothan Amos, who confirmed the development to our correspondent on Tuesday, said the party would work hard to avoid a repeat of what happened in Rivers State where the party was barred from presenting candidates because of suits filed by some members.

He said, “We are talking with them, in every political process of such nature there must be some aggrieved minds.

“We have set up a committee to handle that with a clear template but we are not going to tele-guide them.”
