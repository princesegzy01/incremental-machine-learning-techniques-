Bello orders payments of full salaries to Kogi LG workers

The Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, has ordered the payment of full salaries to the workers of local government areas in the state.

The state Chairman of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria, Alhaji Taufiq Isa, told journalists on Wednesday that the governor had given the order since last week.

Recall that the local government workers in the state had on Tuesday issued a five-day ultimatum to the state government to comply with NFIU directives on payment of full salaries to local government workers.

Isa said the clarification became necessary in view of the rumour making the rounds that Administrators, Directors of Local Government and Treasurers had been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission for refusing to effect 100 percent salary payments against the directives of the Nigeria Financial Intelligent Units that local government workers salaries should be accorded top priority.

Isa, who is also the administrator of Ijumu LGA, said ALGON was not aware of the invitation by the EFCC or the arrest of any official of the state and described the speculation as nothing but fallacy which should be disregarded.

He called on workers in the 21 local government areas to be patient as it was not possible for any director or treasurer to flout the order of the governor.
