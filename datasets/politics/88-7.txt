A former Ogun State Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Olamilekan Adegbite, has been nominated as a minister by President Muhammadu Buhari.

Adegbite served as a commissioner under the immediate past Governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun.

Amosun’s Commissioner for Finance, Mr. Kemi Adeosun, was similarly appointed the Minister of Finance but left office following allegations that her National Youth Service Corps’ exemption certificate was forged.

Amosun’s ability to influence the appointment of his former commissioner despite his suspension by the ruling All Progressives Congress has again reaffirmed his closeness to the President.

The former governor, who now represents Ogun-Central senatorial district, fell out with APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole; and leader, Bola Tinubu; as well as the Vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo; and current Governor, Dapo Abiodun.

He sponsored Adekunle Akinlade of the Allied Peoples Movement as governor against the wishes of the APC which led to his suspension from the party five months ago.
