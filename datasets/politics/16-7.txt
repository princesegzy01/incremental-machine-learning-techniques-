PDP, others not campaigning in Kogi –APC
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The ruling All Progressives Congress in Kogi State on Thursday claimed the Peoples Democratic Party and other opposition parties had not been campaigning ahead of the November 16 governorship election.

The Director-General, Bello Onoja Campaign Committee, Smart Adeyemi, made the allegation on behalf of the party in a telephone interview with our correspondent.

Adeyemi claimed that the silence in the camps of the opposition parties could mean that they had accepted defeat.

He said, “Have you seen their campaign posters, billboards or handbills in any part of the state?

“They are not also engaging us in anyway, they claimed to be doing a house-to-house campaign, but we are also going from house to house and we have not met them anywhere.

“This is pregnant with meaning and we want the security agencies to be vigilant to prevent innocent citizens from being harmed.”

Adeyemi, however, expressed satisfaction with what he called the level of acceptance of Governor Yahaya Bello.

He attributed the acceptance to the people-oriented programmes outlined in his manifesto.

However, the Director-General, Musa Wada/ Aro Campaign Council, Faruk Adejo, said Adeyemi’s claim was made out of ignorance.

He said the PDP’s campaign would formally start on Friday (today).

“We are starting our campaign on Friday. But that is to fulfil our political tradition.”
