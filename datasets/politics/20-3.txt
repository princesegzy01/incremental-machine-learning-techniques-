Some groups in the Kogi West Senatorial District have endorsed the candidature of Governor Yahaya Bello for a second term.

They said their decision was to embolden their political emancipation in the next election when they believe that power will shift to the district.

This was stated in a communiqué issued at the end of the Kogi West Political summit with the theme, ‘Renegotiating Kogi West position for 2019,’ held on Saturday in Kabba, the senatorial district headquarters.

Reading the communiqué endorsed by all the participants, Chief J. O. Yusuf said their support for Bello was to be better positioned for the 2023 governorship poll in the state.

The communiqué read in part, “That the meeting had in attendance, the Chairman, Okun traditional council, Oba Solomon Owoniyi; representative of Ohimege of Koto and other prominent traditional rulers.

“That speakers after speakers, aligned with Governor Yahaya Bello of the APC as their preferred candidate for the November 16 poll.

“That the decision of the senatorial district to support the governor was hinged on the political calculation of securing the central zone support in 2023 for total power shift.”

The Director General Bello/Onoja Campaign Council, Senator Smart Adeyemi, advised his kinsmen in Kogi West senatorial district to key in to the reelection agenda of the governor.

He said, “Yahaya Bello stands in the best position to guaranttee power shifting to the west and so deserves our support to make our dream come true.”
