Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

The Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State, has dismissed the appeal filed by the Labour Party against the election of the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun .

The Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Kunle Somorin, disclosed this in a statement on Friday.

Somorin said that the court described the Labour Party’s appeal as lacking in merit and outright frivolous.

The statement read in part,” (The) court upheld the submission of counsel to Abiodun and the All Progressives Congress, Wale Ajayi, that the governor was duly elected and calling for the invalidation of the poll that returned him could not stand legal requirements for the nullification of elections.
