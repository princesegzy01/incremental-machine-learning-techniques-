Fleeing kidnap kingpin not our member — YDP
Friday Olokor, Abuja

The Young Democratic Party has faulted reports that the dreaded kidnap kingpin, Alhaji Hamisu Wadume, is its member.

Wadume escaped during the attack on policemen by soldiers in the Ibi Local Government Area of Taraba State.

The party which said it had “no record of his membership,” also dismissed reports that the kingpin contested the Taraba State House of Assembly on its platform during the 2019 general elections.

A statement on Tuesday by the acting National Publicity Secretary of YDP, Ibrahim Jauro, asked the security agencies to unravel the mystery behind the Ibi saga and bring all those culpable to justice.

He said, “The YDP wishes to state categorically that two party members from the Ibi LGA procured EOI/nomination forms as aspirants for the Taraba State House of Assembly and Alhaji Hamisu Wadume was not one of them. We have no record of his membership whatsoever.
