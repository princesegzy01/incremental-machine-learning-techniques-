Bayelsa gov poll battle
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Bayelsa Forward Movement has described the forthcoming November 16 governorship election in the state as a political contest between “good and evil.”

The coordinator of the group, Mr Alfred Kemepado, said this during a solidarity visit to Government House in Yenagoa on Thursday.

Kemepado, according to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, said, “The Peoples Democratic Party represents the good while the All Progressives Congress represents evil.”

The BFM leader vowed that its 1,250 members would work against the candidate of the APC, Mr David Lyon, in the pursuit of the collective good of the Ijaw nation.

Receiving the BFM members, Governor Seriake Dickson said the state was almost at the “Promised Land” and would not “retrogress to Egypt.”
