Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has named his former Chief of Staff, Chief Edwin Onoja, as his new deputy.

Onoja is also his running mate in the November 16 governorship election.

Sources told Saturday PUNCH that Onoja may be sworn in today.

The naming of Onoja as the new deputy governor followed the alleged impeachment of the former deputy governor, Simon Achuba, by the state House of Assembly on the recommendations of the judicial panel of inquiry set up to investigate allegations of gross misconduct levelled against him.
