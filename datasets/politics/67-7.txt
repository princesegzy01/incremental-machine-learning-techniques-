Taraba, APC bicker over delayed cabinet
Justin Tyopuusu, Jalingo

Barely three months after the inauguration of Darius Ishaku as Governor of Taraba State, the All Progressives Congress has accused the governor of holding the state to ransom by delaying the composition of his new cabinet.

The state Chairman of the APC, Ibrahim El-Sudi, who spoke to journalists in Jalingo, said the governor had no reason to delay his new cabinet.

El-Sudi stated that though Ishaku had faced court cases in 2015, he was not being challenged like other governors.

“Besides, he is not a newcomer and should not be retarded by any case. The way forward is for Tarabans to call the governor to appoint commissioners in order to move the state forward to the next level.”

But the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Ishaku on Media and Publicity, Bala Dan Abu, said the governor was taking his time to avoid any mistakes in the composition of his cabinet.

“He has to do a thorough job because this is the last lap for him to govern the state.

“We are appealing to Tarabans to be patient with the governor for him to pick the right team to work with him for the good of the state.”
