I’ve good case at tribunal, says Kalu
Sunday Nwakanma, Umuahia

The All Progressives Congress candidate for Aba North and South Federal Constituency, Chief Mascot Uzor-Kalu, says he is confident that he has a good case to recover his mandate at the tribunal.

Kalu spoke on Monday after the Justice A. A. Aderibigbe-led National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Umuahia adjourned hearing in the matter.

Stating that the tribunal rejected some of the documents he tendered, he said he was confident that it would not be injurious to his petition.

“It is a major document that they refused to accept but the result sheets have already been accepted as evidence. So we hope that the true result will be announced. We sent the proof that election was called before collation was completed. It’s a little setback but not enough to detour the case,’’ he said.

Kalu, a former Chief of Staff to Abia State Government and the younger brother of the senator representing Abia North, Dr Orji Uzor-Kalu, urged his supporters to continue to be steadfast and patient.

He promised to fight to the end, adding that he expected victory at the end.

His counsel, Perfect Okorie, while addressing journalists, expressed satisfaction with the proceedings at the tribunal so far and expressed hope that justice would be done at the end of the day and victory given to his client.

“The tribunal adjourned for us to present our star witness, which is the petitioner himself and for us to close our case,” he said.

Kalu in his petition is praying the tribunal to declare him winner of the election having scored majority of the lawful votes cast for the constituency.
