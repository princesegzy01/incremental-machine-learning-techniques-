N50bn bond not for Akeredolu’s re-election bid — Commissioner
Peter Dada, Akure

The Ondo State Government has said that the N50bn bond it plans to access is basically to fund new and ongoing capital projects in the state.

The state House of Assembly last Thursday gave the approval to the state government to access the bond.

Speaking on the development on Saturday, the state Commissioner for Information, Mr Donald Ojogo, explained that the bond that would be in two tranches, was not to fund the 2020 second term election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, contrary to some insinuations from the camp of the opposition.

According to him, the N50bn bond has become imperative to enable the government to pay contractors handling various capital projects across the state, especially road contractors.

He said, “When people say it is because we want to go into election, No. Did we take a bond before Akeredolu won the last election? Was it his law office that obtained a bond to win the election? We don’t need a bond to fund Akeredolu’s second term, that is if he so desires to run for second term.

“If he didn’t use a bond to prosecute the 2016 election, he will not need a bond to do this one, because the bond’s conditions are so stringent. That is the way modern governance has gone. The best way is to tie your project to a bond. What government will do is just to guarantee that a contractor has done a particular milestone and he should be paid. So, I don’t see an idea that could be nobler than what the government has initiated.

“The governor didn’t take loan or bond to win his election in 2016, the people freely gave him their mandate, so he can’t take loan to do any re-election.”
