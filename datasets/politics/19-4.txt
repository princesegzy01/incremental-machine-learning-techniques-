Appeal court affirms Uba Sani’s election
Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

The Court of Appeal in Kaduna on Monday affirmed Uba Sani as the duly elected senator for Kaduna Central in the February 23 National Assembly election.

The Peoples Democratic Party’s candidate in the election, Mr Lawal Usman, had dragged the senator to court following the earlier ruling of the election petitions tribunal in favour of Sani of the All Progressives Congress.

But the appellate court dismissed the three grounds of appeal by the PDP’s candidate – that Sani was not qualified to contest as of the time of the election and that the polls were marred by electoral malpractices in some local governments while the third ground was that the elections were marred by violence.

The court, while affirming the tribunal’s judgment, said Sani was qualified and duly elected.

It awarded N100,000 as cost against the PDP candidate.

Justice Adefope Okogie of the appellate court, in the 20 minutes judgment on Monday, said the court upheld the earlier decision of the tribunal.
