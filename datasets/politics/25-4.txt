Leaders from Uromi, Edo State, on Monday, threw their weight behind the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Francis Okiye, and asked him to extend an olive branch to the 12 members-elect who have yet to be inaugurated.

The Uromi leaders, who spoke during a visit to Okiye at the Anthony Enahoro Assembly Complex, said this had become necessary so that they could be inaugurated too.

In an address on behalf of the group, Prof Mike Obadan said, “Your election as the Speaker did not come as a surprise because in your previous two terms, you distinguished yourself as a reliable representative of your constituency. We therefore have faith and implicit confidence in you to do more in this new dispensation.”

The leaders commended Governor Godwin Obaseki for the developmental work of his administration in Uromi.
