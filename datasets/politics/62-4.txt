FBI-wanted suspect didn’t sponsor my election – Ihedioha
Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

The Special Assistant to Governor Emeka Ihedioha on New Media, Izuchukwu Akwarandu, on Monday said Chika Odionyenma did not sponsor the election of his principal in Imo State

Odionyenma is one of the 77 suspected Nigerian fraudsters based on a recent list released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Akwarandu in a statement in Owerri said those who were linking Odionyenma’s alleged fraud dealings to the governor were being “mischievous.”

The governor’s aide said as of the time the governor appointed him into the committee that oversaw his inauguration, there was no fraud case hanging on his neck anywhere in the world.

He explained that Odionyenma’s alleged fraud case was a personal issue and that it had nothing to do with the governor or the Imo State Government.

He said Ihedioha attended some of the programmes that Odionyenma organised because they were meant to empower the people.

Akwarandu also noted that Ihedioha attended the programmes based on the consideration that Odionyenma is an indigene of the state.

He said, “He (Akwarandu) is an Imo State son and it was in that capacity that the governor attended the programmes that he organised. Moreover, those programmes were meant to empower the people and you know that the governor is a man of the people.
