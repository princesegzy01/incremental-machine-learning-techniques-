Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress, Oyo State chapter in the 2019 election, Senator Olufemi Lanlehin, has said Governor Seyi Makinde has yet to fulfil any of the promises he made to him.

Lanlehin, in a statement titled, ‘Makinde Yet to Fulfil Promises,’ clarified on Wednesday that he neither made any request nor was given any financial compensation for surrendering his mandate to support Makinde to upstage the All Progressives Congress in the state.

The statement read in part, “Candidate Seyi Makinde (as he then was) made some promises to me as the incumbent candidate of my party the ADC. I willingly and absolutely agreed to surrender governorship mandate in the common interest of the people of Oyo State.

“Up till date, Governor Makinde has not fulfilled any of the terms of the agreement reached between him and myself. I believe Makinde has not been able to fulfil the terms of the gentleman’s agreement between us (myself and himself) due to the very busy and demanding schedule of his state duties.

“I believe very firmly that the Governor Makinde will fulfil the said terms as soon as he so decides.”
