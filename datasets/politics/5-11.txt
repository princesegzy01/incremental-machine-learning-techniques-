About 40 other political parties through their representatives also appended their signatures to the document pledging to ensure peace in the election.

The signing of the peace accord took place during the Independent National Electoral Commission stakeholders’ meeting in Yenagoa on Thursday ahead of the poll.

The National Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the Inspector-General of Police, Mr Mohammed Adamu, and the chairman, Bayelsa State Traditional Rulers Council, King Alfred Diete-Spiff, were among stakeholders that witnessed the signing of the peace accord.

Yakubu had expressed the commitment of the commission to the conduct of a free, fair, credible and conclusive election in the state.

He said, “The ban on the use of mobile phones and other photographic devices in the voting cubicles is still in force and will be strictly enforced and monitored.

“I urge all stakeholders to continue to shun violence and maintain peaceful conduct during the election.”

The Inspector-General of Police said the security agencies were ready for the governorship poll, which he described as important to the state and the nation.
