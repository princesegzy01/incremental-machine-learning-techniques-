Restore Akpoti as candidate, court orders INEC
Ade Adesomoju, Abuja

The Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to restore Mrs Natasha Akpoti of the Social Democratic Party as a candidate in the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State.

Justice Folashade Giwa-Ogunbanjo held that INEC acted above its powers by disqualifying the party and its governorship candidate from participating in the poll.

She ordered the commission to put the SDP logo on the ballot papers to be used for the election.

Akpoti, her running mate, Adams Khalid, and the SDP had on October 3 jointly filed the suit after INEC refused to accept the nomination of Khalid as a replacement for Mohammed Yakubu who was originally nominated for the deputy governorship candidate.

INEC was said to have rejected the party’s governorship nominations altogether on the grounds that Yakubu, whom the party sought to substitute as the governorship running mate was not qualified, ab initio, on account of his age.

Arguing the plaintiffs’ case at the October 31 hearing, their lawyer, Mr Ola Olanipekun (SAN), contended that only the court and not INEC had the power to disqualify a candidate from participating in an election.

He added that INEC’s refusal to allow the party to substitute its deputy governorship candidate was unlawful as the attempted substitution was done 45 days before the governorship election.

Their prayers were granted by the court on Thursday.
