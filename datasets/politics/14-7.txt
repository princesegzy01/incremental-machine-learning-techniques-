Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The abducted father of the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Doodei Week, has yet to be released by his kidnappers.

It was gathered on Sunday that Chief Agbabou Week, 85, was still in the custody of the kidnappers 27 days after he was abducted.

Chief Week, who is the monarch of Tarakiri clan in the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, was taken away by the gunmen who invaded his Ayama-Ijaw country home on October 2, 2019.

About five days after whisking their victim away in a speedboat, the hoodlums reportedly contacted the family and demanded N150m as ransom.

It was learnt that they later reduced the money to N5m.

But a close family source on Sunday told our correspondent said that the assailants had also taken hostage the person who was sent to give them the N5m.

He said, “The kidnappers of the octogenarian were said to have complained that the amount was too small.”

Recall that Chief Week was abducted four days after the 80-year-old. Beauty Siasia, the mother of former Super Eagles’ head coach, Mr Samson Siasia, was released by her abductors.

She regained her freedom on September 29 after spending 77 days in kidnappers’ den
