Ladoja, Alli deny dumping ZLP
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

A former governor of Oyo State, Rashidi Ladoja; and the governorship candidate of the Zenith Labour Party in the last general elections in the state, Chief Sharafadeen Alli, on Sunday said there was no truth the report that they were planning to dump the party for the All Progressives Congress.

Alli, in a statement made available to journalists in Ibadan, the state capital, said the stories making the round “that Senator Ladoja and I are leaving the ZLP for the APC was concocted to distort facts and heat up the polity.”
