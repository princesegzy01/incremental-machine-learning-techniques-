The Court of Appeal, Lagos Division, has ordered the Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal in Lagos State to resume hearing in the petitions challenging the election of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the All Progressives Congress.

A five-man appellate court panel held on Tuesday that the tribunal was wrong to have discontinued hearing on the basis that the petitioners, Alliance for Democracy, and its governorship candidate for Lagos State for the March 9, 2019 governorship election, Chief Owolabi Salis, abandoned their petition.

“From the records, it is clear that the tribunal was wrong to have declared the petition as an abandoned petition.

“The case is to be remitted to the lower court for expeditious hearing of the matter,” the court held.

Similarly, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the tribunal dismissing the petition filed by Labour Party and its governorship candidate for the election, Ifagbemi Awamaridi.

The appellate court ordered the return of the petition to the tribunal for expeditious determination.
