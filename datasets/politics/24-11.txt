Saraki not a factor in Kogi politics –Ohikere
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The Secretary of the Media and Publicity Committee of the All Progressives Congress Campaign Council in the forthcoming Kogi State governorship election, Dr Tom Ohikere, has said former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, does not command the influence to facilitate reconciliation within the Kogi State’s chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party or pull the party from the brink of defeat.

The PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, on Friday named Saraki as the chairman of a five-man reconciliation committee charged with the task of reuniting the PDP factions in the state.

Ohikere, who spoke to journalists in Abuja, said Saraki was never a close friend of the people of the state.

He said, “What does Bukola Saraki know of Kogi politics? He never established any warm relationship with our people, not even the state chapter of the PDP, even when he was the Senate President. What did the state chapter of the PDP benefit from him?”

“Now all of a sudden, they want the PDP in Kogi State to refer to him. A PDP that is desperately struggling to find its bearings amidst a surge of defections and altercations.”

According to him, the PDP in Kogi state has no bearing oscillating between former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar and Saraki.
