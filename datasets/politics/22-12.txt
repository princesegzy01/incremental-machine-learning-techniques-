Kogi election: Wada, others beg Ibrahim to withdraw suit against PDP
Success Nwogu, Abuja

A former Governor of Kogi State, Capt.Idris Wada (retd) and nine other former governorship aspirants in the state have pleaded with a former aspirant, Abubakar Ibrahim, to withdraw his suit against the Peoples Democratic Party and its governorship candidate in Kogi, Mr Musa Wada.

The coordinator of the campaign for the former aspirants, Mohammed Shaibu, in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja, described Ibrahim as a great asset to the party and the state. He added that efforts were being made to get him to support the governorship candidate of the PDP in the state.

Shaibu said, “There is one among us that has gone to court and that is Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim. He still has a pending case in the court and we are trying to see how we can persuade him to withdraw the case. We have not succeeded as I talk with you now. I have been having a series of discussions with him.

“We are hoping that he will agree with us and allow the case to be withdrawn from the court, so that we can go into the election as one body ready to dislodge the tyrant we have in Kogi State.”
