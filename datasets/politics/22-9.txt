Bayelsa election: Don’t cheat ad hoc staff, INEC warns electoral officers
The Independent National Electoral Commission has advised its Electoral Officers in Bayelsa State to be transparent in the payment of entitlements to ad hoc workers to be used for the November 16 governorship election.

INEC National Commissioner, Prof. Okechukwu Ibeanu, gave the advice during an interactive session between members of staff of the commission in Bayelsa and the commission’s Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu in Yenegoa.

He said the commission had put in place modality to prevent situation where engaged ad hoc workers would complain or protest about payment for their services after elections.

Ibeanu also stressed the need to get the arrangement for transportation right, especially in a state with a difficult terrain like Bayelsa.

Ibeanu said the success of any election would depend on INEC’s capacity to ensure a viable transport system for logistics deployment

“One, we expect that you have started planning in advance to make sure that transportation is a done deal in this election,” he said.

He called for effective collaboration among the workers in ensuring that they work as a team for the success of the state governorship election.
