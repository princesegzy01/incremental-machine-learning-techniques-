El-Rufai threatens to sack non-performing commissioners
Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna

governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on Friday said he would sack any of the newly appointed commissioners who fail to perform in their various ministries.

According to the governor, the commissioners must settle down and quickly deliver results.

El-Rufai, who gave the warning while swearing in 13 out of the 15 commissioner-nominees forwarded to the state House of Assembly for confirmation, said each of the commissioners would be made to sign a performance agreement with the top management of their ministries.

One of the governor’s nominees, Jafaaru Abubakar, was rejected during screening by the Assembly for criticising the All Progressives Congress’ administration in the state on his Facebook handle in 2017.

El-Rufai also mandated his deputy, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, to take charge of the State Ministry of Health, pending when a substantive commissioner would be appointed for the ministry.

He said, “Every commissioner must in turn sign Key Performance Indicators and Performance Agreements with the top management of their ministries.

“All are subject to strict quarterly reviews, because we must maximise the short time left to deliver service for our people.”

The governor also warned family members and associates of the new commissioners against asserting undue pressure on them.

“Family members and associates must realise that the commissioners would need their support. We thank you for the sacrifice you would make, but we urge you not to pressurise them,” he added.
