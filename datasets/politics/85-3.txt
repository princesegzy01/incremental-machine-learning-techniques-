APC tasks North-Central states on regional integration
Kamarudeen Ogundele

The All Progressives Congress has called on states in the North-Central region to evolve strategies aimed at fostering regional integration and economic development.

The ruling party said the zone, comprising Nasarawa, Kogi, Kwara, Plateau, Niger and Benue states, should tap into its abundant mineral deposits to give the nation an alternative to oil revenues.

The partyâ€™s National Vice-Chairman (North-Central), Alhaji Sulaiman Wambai, made the call during a meeting and mini-convention, where the position of the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, was also ratified.

Wambia, who lamented that the zone was losing billions of naira due to a lack of economic development, called on the stakeholders to initiate programmes that would benefit the people in the zone and the country at large.
