Ameh returns as IPAC President
Friday Olokor, Abuja

The national chairman of Progressives Peoples Alliance, Chief Peter Ameh was on Tuesday re-elected to lead the Inter-Party Advisory Council of Nigeria for another tenure with a total of 62 votes.

The election which was held at The Electoral Institute in Abuja was supervised by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission amidst tight security.

Speaking with journalists after being declared winner, Ameh asked for the cooperation of his rivals in moving IPAC foreward.

While warning that forthwith, any IPAC State chairman that endorses governorship would be sacked, he reiterated the call for Local Government autonomy.

Ameh warned state governors to desist from killing new political parties in Nigeria.

At the event, the Director of Political Parties Finance and Monitoring, Damian Akhamhe, said the election was the best of the IPAC elections he had seen.
