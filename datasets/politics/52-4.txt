PDP ready to reclaim Kogi —Gov candidate, Wada
The Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in Kogi State, Mr Musa Wada, has said that the party is ready to reclaim the mantle of leadership in the state via the November 16 election.

Wada, who said this while speaking with newsmen on Sunday in Abuja, said that Kogi traditionally belongs to the PDP and the party was ready to take over the state.

He said members of PDP in Kogi were not afraid of the power of incumbency and would be committed to a peaceful and issue-based campaign.

Wada, who was on Friday issued with the Certificate of Return by the party, said that the PDP was going into action, constituting necessary committees and at due time, start a peaceful campaign across the state.

Wada said that though Nigerians were aware of how volatile Kogi used to be during an election period, PDP was fully committed to a peaceful and issue-based campaign.

“No civilised democracy tolerates violence but then I have to hasten to say that nobody has a monopoly of violence.

“PDP is a peaceful party. We will not encourage violence, but that is not to say that we will seat and fold our hands when we are being tormented by forces that are undemocratic.

“Traditionally, Kogi is a PDP state and we have always removed incumbent governors.

“Back to history, PDP removed former Governor, Prince Abubakar Audu in 2003.’’

Wada, who urged the people not to allow political elements to use them for electoral violence, urged the All Progressives Congress to embrace peaceful election, saying violence does not help anybody.
