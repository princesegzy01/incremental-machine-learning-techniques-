The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has hailed members from Ondo State for giving him a bloc vote in the speakership election.

He said that was the reason the lawmakers from the state were made leaders of critical committees popularly referred to as ‘juicy committees.’

Gbajabiamila stated this while addressing traditional rulers from Akoko-North and Akoko-West Federal Constituency who visited him in Abuja on Monday.

He said lawmakers from Ondo State comprising members of the ruling All Progressives Congress and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, voted for him.
