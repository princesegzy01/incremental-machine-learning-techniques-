The Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo -Agege, has commended the Belema Oil Producing Limited for relocating its headquarters to the Niger Delta.

Omo -Agege, according to a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yomi Odunuga, gave the commendation in a letter to the oil firm.

He said Belema Oil, by the action, had set an example worth emulating.

The letter read partly, “Your relocation will not only foster a productive engagement strategy for mutual wealth creation, it would also go a long way towards engendering trust between operator and host communities while also helping to sustain peace.”
