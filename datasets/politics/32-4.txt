Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun said he planned to prioritise capital projects in the state’s 2020 budget.

The governor who expressed concerns over inconsistent budgetary, projections of Ministries Departments and Agencies with government policies and priorities, said they were bound to suffer a setback.

Abiodun spoke through his Consultant on Budget and Planning, Mr Olaolu Olabimtan, on Thursday at a workshop organised for ‘Stakeholders in the Information, Culture, Religion and Public Order Sectors’ of the state in Abeokuta,

He said, “I wish to advise that you move from the medium sectoral strategy framework you have been used to, and begin to match ambition with reality, recognise critical areas that required urgent attention, since there are limited resources .”

The governor also stated that the state government had begun the implementation of Medium Term Expenditure Framework in line with international best practices.
