‘Akeredolu not hospitalised’
The absence of the Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, from office of late has been generating reactions from various quarters as some alleged that the governor has come down with an illness, occasioned by food poisoning.

The Deputy Governor, Mr Agboola Ajayi, has been performing as the acting governor due to the absence of the governor.

But the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, on Thursday cleared the air on the whereabouts of the governor, saying he was not ill.

Ojogo, who spoke with journalists in Akure, said the governor was on his annual vacation and had returned to Abuja where he had been attending to various matters that concerned the state.
