Friday Olokor, Abuja

The Independent National Electoral Commission has fixed November 16, 2019 for the election in Kogi West Senatorial District.

The commission also fixed November 30, 2019, as the date for the conduct of a bye-election for Sabuwa constituency of Katsina State.

By this, former chairman, Senate Committee of the Federal Capital Territory, Dino Melaye of the Peoples Democratic Party would slug it out with a former President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress, on the same date that the governorship election would take place.

INEC National Commissioner and chairman of its Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, gave the dates in a statement in Abuja on Monday.

Okoye said, “The commission has fixed November 16, 2019 for the conduct of a fresh election in the Kogi West Senatorial District. The election will take place simultaneously with the Kogi govemorship election.

“This is sequel to the nullification of the Kogi West Senatorial District election conducted on February 23 2019, by the election petitions tribunal and its subsequent affirmation by the Court of Appeal which ordered the commission to conduct a fresh election within 90 days from the date of judgment (October 11, 2019) with all those who participated in it as eligible candidates.

“Following extensive consultations with stakeholders and a review of the security situation with the relevant security agencies, the commission has fixed November 30, 2019 for the conduct of a bye-election for the state constituency.”
