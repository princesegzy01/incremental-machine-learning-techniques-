PDP rejects Buhari’s plans to return toll gates

The Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday rejected plans by the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to return toll gates to highways in Nigeria.

The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement, said the idea was insensitive and lamentable.

He stated that the insensitive idea, in the midst of excruciating economic hardship and high costs of living occasioned by the alleged incompetence and harsh policies of the administration, was completely ill-conceived and anti-people.

He said, “The PDP insists that at best, such idea amounts to executive bullying which cannot be justified under any guise as it will lead to more increase in costs of goods and services across the country.

“Only recently, President Buhari approved the increase of Value Added Tax from five per cent to 7.2 per cent despite outcry by Nigerians, who are also being made to pay exorbitant tariffs for electricity and other essential services.

“Since Buhari came into office in 2015, his administration had continued to increase prices and impose all manner of levies on Nigerians which proceeds are being frittered by the cabal in the presidency leading to a bleeding economy and despondency among the citizenry.”

Ologbondiyan said that instead of putting more pressure on the already impoverished Nigerians by introducing toll gates at this point in time, “Buhari should exert himself, seek ways of creating wealth out of the abundant resources at the disposal of his administration or make haste to surrender the reign of governance to more competent hands.”

“The PDP, therefore, charges President Buhari to immediately rescind the decision to return toll gates on our highways as such is not in the best interest of Nigerians,’ Ologbondiyan concluded.
