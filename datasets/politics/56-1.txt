ICPC seeks seizure of ex-customary Appeal Court President’s N840m
Friday Olokor, Abuja

The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission has demanded the interim forfeiture of N840m traced to a retired President of the Benue State Customary Court of Appeal, Mrs Margaret Igbeta.

A statement in Abuja on Monday by the spokesperson for the commission, Rasheedat Okoduwa, said the ICPC made the demand in an ex parte motion filed at a Federal High Court in Abuja.

According to her, the order will stop Igbeta from accessing the money alleged to have been obtained through fraudulent activities in the course of her official duties.

Okoduwa said, “She was said to have opened the account with her passport and the name of Atsu on the 5th of March, 2008, with an initial deposit of N8m. She subsequently made several other huge deposits in the months of March and May, 2008.

“It was also noted by the commission that the money was far above her legitimate earnings both as a judge and President of the Customary Court of Appeal within the period that the account was operated.”
