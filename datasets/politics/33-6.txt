Adamawa ex-civil servants protest unpaid salary
Hindi Livinus, Yola

Some civil servants on Wednesday in Yola protested their disengagement and non-payment of salaries which entered the sixth month by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri administration.

Former Governor Jibrilla Bindow had, through the waivers he granted some ministries and agencies, employed about 3,000 workers two months before his tenure as governor was due to elapse.

This last-minute employment was reversed by Fintiri.

But the disengaged workers on Wednesday asked the state government to consider their plight and capture them on its payroll.

The aggrieved workers, led by one Faisal Baba, lamented the untold hardship they had to endure in the past six months. When they got to the Government House, there they were received by the Adamawa State Deputy Governor, Crowther Seth.

Seth said Fintiri would resolve the impasse over the last-minute employment carried out by the immediate past administration.
