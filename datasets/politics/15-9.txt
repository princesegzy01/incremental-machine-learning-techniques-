Kogi PDP: Court to deliver judgment Nov 1
Gbenga Odogun

Justice Richard Olorunfemi, the trial judge in the dispute arising from the Peoples Democratic Party’s governorship primary in Kogi State, has reserved ruling till November 1.

Abubakar Ibrahim, the runner-up to the party’s governorship candidate, Mr Musa Wada, had approached the court asking to be declared the winner of the primary which took place on September 3, 2019.

On Friday, the suit challenging the primary’s outcome came up for definite hearing at the Lokoja High Court 4, with Ibrahim mounting the witness box.

He said in his submissions and documents, tendered and marked, that he was the “rightful owner” of the PDP ticket, praying the court to return his mandate.

In their cross-examination, counsels to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants – MS Ibrahim (standing for the PDP), JS Okutepa (Musa Wada) and AN Makwe (Independent National Electoral Commission), respectively – drilled the claimant on his various submissions.

Justice Olorunfemi said the court would make its ruling on the matter on November 1.
