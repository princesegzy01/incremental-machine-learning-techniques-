Gov poll: We accept Supreme Court verdict, says Osun PDP
The Peoples Democratic Party in Osun State said it has accepted the Supreme Court judgment that affirmed Governor Gboyega Oyetola as the winner of the September 2018 governorship election in the state.

Mr Soji Adagunodo, the State PDP Chairman, in a telephone interview with News Agency of Nigeria in Osogbo said since the Supreme Court was the apex court in the land, the party could not appeal the decision.

NAN reports that the Supreme Court in a split judgment of five-to-two on Friday upheld the election of Oyetola.

Adagunodo said the minority judgment dealt with the constitutional issue of the matter, which according to him, was the most important while the majority judgment dealt with the technical issues.

“Since the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land, we don’t have anything to say than to accept the verdict.

“The judgment is a split judgment.

“The majority judgment dealt with technical matter and we expected the judges to have called for the file of the lower court.

“Meanwhile, the majority judgment dealt with a constitutional matter which is important to our democracy.

“The court has ruled and we don’t have anything to say than to accept the verdict since there is nowhere to go again,’’ Adagunodo said.

He, however, appealed to party members to be calm and peaceful.
