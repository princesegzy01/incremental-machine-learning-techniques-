“We realised that all parts of the case have been taken care of. So there is no point over flogging the matter at the tribunal.

“With the witnesses so far cross-examined, we have enough evidence to secure justice in our favour. That is why we closed the case,’’ he said.

Mr Adebayo Adelogun, Counsel to the governor expressed surprise at the decision but applauded the move and said his team was not against it.

“We were surprised because as of yesterday, the indication was that another witness would be called today. So we came prepared for that.

“Were we surprised? Yes but pleasantly surprised. We are very prepared to respond. Don’t forget we are the respondents,’’ he said.

Justice Abba Bello-Mohammed, Chairman of the tribunal, adjourned the case till July 6 for the respondents to respond to evidence brought by the petitioner.
