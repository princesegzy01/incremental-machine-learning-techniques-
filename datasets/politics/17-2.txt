Nasarawa gov pursuing religious agenda — CAN
Umar Muhammed, Lafia

The Christian Association of Nigeria, Nasarawa State chapter, has accused Governor Abdullahi Sule of having a religious agenda following recent appointments in the state.

The association’s chairman, Bishop Joseph Masin, made the allegation at a press conference on Thursday in Lafia.

Masin noted that all former governors of the state, including Abdullahi Adamu, late Aliyu Doma, and Tanko Al-Makura gave fair representation to the two major religions in the state.

He said, “I think the governor is running a religious administration in the state, the appointments he announced are not balanced.

“At least, out of 15 commissioners, he should have given Christians seven slots. Nobody would have raised an eyebrow.

“But it is glaring that out of 15, only four slots were given to Christians.”

The governor, who spoke through his Director-General, Strategic Communications and Press Affairs, Mr Yakubu Lamai, however, said he had no reason to pursue any religious agenda.

“The governor has no reason whatsoever to champion a sectional or religious agenda other than to encourage all men of goodwill from all religious persuasions to join politics in order to move Nasarawa State forward,” Lamai said.
