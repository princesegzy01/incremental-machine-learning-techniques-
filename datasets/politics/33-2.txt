Ondo lawmakers resume sitting inside temporary chamber
Peter Dada, Akure

After several months of indefinite suspension of plenary, the Ondo State lawmakers have resumed legislative sessions in a makeshift hallowed chamber.

The legislators had declared an indefinite suspension of plenary few months ago following the dilapidated condition of the old chamber and promised not to return until Governor Rotimi Akeredolu renovated the chamber.

The lawmakers reportedly rushed out of the Assembly complex during a plenary in July 2019, when a big snake fell from the ceiling of the old chamber, which had caved in.

Since then, there had been no plenary in the Assembly.

With the availability of a makeshift hallowed chamber, the members of the House said they were set for “robust” legislative duties.

It was gathered that the makeshift hallowed chamber was constructed by the state government to be used temporarily by the lawmakers.

Speaking at the inauguration of the temporary chamber on behalf of the Assembly, the Chief Whip of the House, Dr Adeyemi Olayemi, commended Akeredolu for his intervention by facilitating the renovation of the temporary chamber.

Olayemi, representing the Owo State Constituency II, noted that the development would further enhance the performance of their legislative duties.

He said, “We now have a more convenient place to carry out our legislative duties, pending the completion and total rehabilitation of the old structure by the executive arm.”
