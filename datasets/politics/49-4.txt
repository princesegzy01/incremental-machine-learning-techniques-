Tribunal: I did not congratulate Buhari —Fayose
Former Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State has denied congratulating President Muhammadu Muhammadu Buhari on his victory at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal.

He said this on his verified Twitter handle on Wednesday, after the five- man panel led by Justice Mohammed Garba dismissed the petition of the Peoples Democratic Party and that of its presidential candidate in the last general elections, Atiku Abubakar, for failing to prove the claims made in its petition.

Fayose tweeted, ” Nigerians should disregard any congratulatory message issued in my name on the outcome of the Presidential Election Judgment.

“My party has indicated its intention to appeal the judgment, and as a party man and believer in the PDP/ATIKU 2019 project, I can’t author such statement.”
