VIDEO: Smart Adeyemi is my political wife —Dino Melaye
Senator Dino Melaye has described his opponent, Senator Smart Adeyemi of the All Progressives Congress as his ‘political wife’ as he said that he (Melaye) had beaten him (Adeyemi) at the polls on two separate occasions.

He said this in a video posted on his official Instagram handle in the early hours of Saturday.

In the video, Melaye, who represented Kogi West in the red chamber until he was sacked said, “I have said it time and time again and I’m repeating it again, Smart Adeyemi is my political wife.

“I was in APC, I contested against him in PDP, I defeated him. I came to PDP, he went to APC, I defeated him, that is 2-0. We are going back for the third time, it will be a hat-trick. I will score the third goal,” he boasted.

On Friday, the Court of Appeal invalidated the election of Melaye and ordered a rerun.

Melaye made the announcement on his social media handle while calling for calm amongst his supporters.

He had tweeted, “I just lost my election at the Appeal Court and fresh election ordered. In all things, I give God the praise. He who started a good thing will definitely complete it. I ask my supporters to be law-abiding as we shall always overcome. To God be the glory.”

Senator Smart Adeyemi of the APC had gone to the tribunal to contest the victory of Melaye at the polls. The tribunal sacked Melaye and he appealed the ruling.

The Appeal Court upheld the judgement of the tribunal and ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct a fresh election within 90 days from Friday.
