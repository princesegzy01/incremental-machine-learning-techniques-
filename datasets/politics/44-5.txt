Chidiebube Okeoma, Owerri

The National Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal in Owerri on Wednesday sacked a member of the House of Representatives, Obinna Onwubuariri.

Onwubuariri is currently representing Isiala Mbano/Onuimo/Okigwe Federal Constituency of Imo State.

He was first elected into the House of Representatives in 2015.

In her judgment which lasted for about two hours, the Chairman of the Panel, R. Harriman, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to conduct a fresh poll in the federal constituency within 90 days from the date of the judgment.

According to the judge, the petitioner, Miriam Onuoha, of the All Progressives Congress, was able to prove her petition beyond reasonable doubt.

The judge said INEC and the first respondent were unable to defend the allegations of over voting, mutilation of figures, and the reduction of the petitioner’s votes preferred against them by the petitioner.

The panel, which ordered a fresh poll in the federal constituency, instructed that the first respondent’s certificate of return should be withdrawn immediately.

Harriman said the declaration of the lawmaker, who is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, was done in utter disregard of the Electoral Act, as amended.

An aide to the sacked lawmaker, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said that his principal would appeal the judgment.
