Leave Dickson alone, Bayelsa govt tells APC
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Bayelsa State government has advised members and leaders of the All Progressives Congress in the state to leave the state governor, Mr. Seriake Dickson, out of the internal problems of the party.

The government said that Dickson was too focused to be distracted by a failed attempt to drag his name into the internal problems of the opposition APC in the state.

In a statement on Wednesday by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media Relations, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, the government said the governor’s major focus was to produce a credible candidate that would defeat any candidate presented by the APC in the November 16, 2019 governorship contest in the state.

According to him, it was common knowledge that Dickson had worked hard to decimate the APC in Bayelsa State, and was getting ready to defeat the party at the polls as usual.

Soriwei stressed that the PDP candidate, who would run on the governor’s track record and the enthronement of peace and stability would retain the party’s control on political power in Bayelsa with a resounding victory.

The governor’s media aide said that the PDP, which had been in control in Bayelsa since the return to democratic governance in 1999, did not need any secret deal with the APC to defeat the opposition party.

He said that there was no such deal contrary to the mischievous rumour about purported meetings.

Soriwei also stressed that Governor Dickson had led the PDP on several occasions, including the last general elections, to defeat the APC even when the party had become an opposition party at the national level.

He urged the APC to focus on their internal problems and to leave the PDP and its aspirants to plan and execute the next victory against the APC.

Soriwei called on the leadership of the APC to prepare for an election and not a war.
