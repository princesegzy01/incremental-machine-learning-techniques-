Investigate alleged N17.5bn diversion in Bayelsa, APC urges EFCC
The All Progressives Congress has called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to investigate an alleged diversion of N17.5bn by the Bayelsa Government.

The APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Yekini Nabena, made the call in a statement issued on Sunday in Abuja.

Nabena also urged the EFCC and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit to investigate all the bank accounts belonging to the state government.

He alleged that the N17.5bn was illegally withdrawn on the order of Governor Seriake Dickson to prosecute the November 16 governorship election in the state.

Nabena said: “In the last two weeks, the Bayelsa state government has, in highly suspicious circumstances, made several withdrawals to the tune of N17.5bn without any corresponding project to justify such withdrawals.

“The insider reports we received stated that Governor Seriake Dickson approved the illegal withdrawals to fund the election of the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in the state.

“The EFCC and the NFIU must urgently freeze the state government accounts to stop further illegal withdrawals.

“The anti-graft agencies must also track down the already withdrawn N17.5bn.”
