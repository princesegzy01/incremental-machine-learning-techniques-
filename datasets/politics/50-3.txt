Ex-HoS urges Ayade to embrace consultation
Ada Wodu, Calabar

A former Head of Service in Cross River State, Chief Wilfred Inah, has advised Governor Ben Ayade to emulate his predecessors in governing the state.

Inah, who gave the advice while speaking with journalists in Calabar, said Ayade should adopt consultation as one of the procedures to attain good governance.

He said, “When Jacob Esuene was appointed the military governor of South Eastern State (now Cross River State) in 1967, he brought together 14 people under the chairmanship of Dr Okoi Arikpo and asked them to advise him on how to govern the state.

“During Governor Liyel Imoke’s administration, there was Elders’ Forum which met regularly with the governor and commissioners at least four times a year during which policies were discussed before they were implemented.

“When you are appointed into office, consult people who are experienced to work with rather than going as a lone ranger. Old people may be weak but they can contribute intellectually to governance. Consultation should be used as procedure to attain good governance.”

Inah advised the governor to build on the successes of his predecessors by fixing infrastructure, create permanent employment through industrialisation and create farm settlements.
