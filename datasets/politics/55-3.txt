The jurist said that the APC and its candidate did not convince the tribunal why its candidate should have been declared the winner.

Ahuchaogu said that there were no proofs by Igbokwe for the tribunal to believe claims that over-voting, violence and electoral malpractices marred the election.

The tribunal also said that the petitioner could not prove his claim that the winner of the election, who was the first respondent in the petition was not qualified to stand for the election.

While dismissing the petition, the tribunal resolved all the prayers of the petitioner in favour of the first respondent.

Ahuchaogu said, “The petition is hereby dismissed and the prayers sought by the petitioner is hereby resolved in favour of the first respondent.”

S.A Anyalelechi was counsel to the first respondent while I.F Akpaonye was Igbokwe’s counsel.

Igbokwe, who is an aide to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajiabamila, was in the House of Representatives between 2011 and 2019.
