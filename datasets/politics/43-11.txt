PDP senator dumps party, joins APC
Kamarudeen Ogundele, Abuja

A member of the Sixth Senate, who represented Bayelsa East Senatorial district between 2007 and 2011 on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party, Sen. Nimi Barigha-Amange, has indicated his intention to join the ruling All Progressives Congress.

Barigha-Amange gave the notice in a letter to the APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, which was submitted to the acting National Secretary, Victor Giadom, on Wednesday.

The former senator, who said he had resigned his membership from his former party, stated that he was moving with members of his political family, all members of Destiny Movement and SIG Elite Foundation of the Nembe and Brass local government areas.

He said his decision to defect to the APC was due to the alleged authoritarian attitude of Governor Seriake Dickson.

The former lawmaker said out of eight LGAs, the APC had taken three and the PDP was holding on to two, while the remaining three would be divided “equally.”

He said, “Today, I can tell you that the candidate of the APC, David Lyon, comes from Southern Ijaw LGA. That is the local government with the highest voting strength. Definitely, that local government is for the APC. I come from Nembe LGA, and by my joining the APC, Nembe has fallen into the hands of the APC.

“Brass is where Timipre Sylva comes from and Brass normally is for the APC. And I also assisted the APC in winning my own senatorial district in the last elections. I also assisted the APC in winning the House of Representatives seat during the February elections. So, those three LGs are gone and we can give Kolokuma/Opokuma, the smallest LG to the PDP because their candidate is from there.”
