Why I haven’t formed my cabinet –Wike
Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt

The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, explained on Tuesday that he had not set up his cabinet because he was shopping for passionate and dedicated persons to appoint.

He said he could not be bothered by criticisms because he was committed to doing what was right for Rivers State.

The governor spoke when the Committee for Accreditation and Approval of Private Schools in Rivers State submitted its report at the Government House in Port Harcourt.

He said, “I have not formed my cabinet because I am taking my time to monitor and look at people who would work with passion for Rivers State.

“Politics is involved, but you must be ready to work for the state. That is why you see that there is a delay in the formation of the cabinet. No matter the criticism, I will do what is right.”

Wike said the focus of his administration was to sustain the development of Rivers State.

He said he set up the Committee for Accreditation and Approval of Private Schools in Rivers State because of the urgent need to check the downward slide of private schools in the state.

“We must work to move Rivers State forward. In doing that, we must step on toes. We can’t allow the state to be the way it is.

“I believe that with the calibre of persons who served in the committee, you have done a good job. I have confidence in the committee.

“People have unnecessarily commercialised education. They have become traders in the field of education. We will not allow that to continue,” he said.
