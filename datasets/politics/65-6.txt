Olalekan Adetayo, Abuja

The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has urged Nigerians to be ready at all times to share opinions with government on how best to tackle the various security challenges facing the country.

Aregbesola, who was inaugurated and assigned a portfolio alongside 42 other ministers by President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, made the call while speaking at a reception organised in his honour by some of his associates later in the day in Abuja.

Acknowledging internal insecurity as one of the major challenges facing Nigeria, the minister said the present administration would appreciate suggestions that could help in the formulation of new government policies aimed at tackling the challenges.

He said, “We appeal to all of you with ideas. Nobody is a repository of ideas because nobody has all the ideas on earth.

“We are appealing to you to share ideas, opinions, suggestions and strategies that can help us to remove, reduce and totally eliminate all the security threats facing our nation.
