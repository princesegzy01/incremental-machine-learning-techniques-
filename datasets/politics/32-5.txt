Tunde Oyekola, Ilorin

Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman Abdulrazaq, on Tuesday visited the state’s Special Needs School where he donated audio books for the use of visually-impaired students and congratulated the students on Nigeria’s 59th independence.

The governor’s visit came after the students returned from the Independence Day parade at the Metropolitan Square in Ilorin, the state capital.

According to a statement signed by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, AbdulRazaq also inspected the ongoing renovation of two blocks of five classrooms in the school.

It said, “The renovation works came following AbdulRazaq’s maiden visit to the school in July, during which he lamented the neglect of the school and pledged to ensure that the facilities are upgraded.”

The statement quoted the school’s principal, Mrs Faoziyah Aroyehun, as commending the governor for the audio books which she said would be useful for the pupils.
