A former factional chairman of the All Progressives Congress in Delta State, Adolor Okotie-Eboh, is dead.

Adolor, son of late First Republic Finance Minister, Festus Okotie-Eboh, died on Saturday aged 64.

The deceased, an American trained pilot, was also the former chairman of Delta State chapter of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria.

Sources within the APC told our correspondent on Sunday that the deceased died after a brief illness on Saturday at undisclosed hospital.

He was among the founding members of the APC from Delta.

The late Adolor was a factional APC chairman after he lost in the state to Mr. Jones Erue.

However, a former Delta State governor and chieftain of the APC, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan, has described the passage of Adolor, who hails from Koko in Warri North Council Area of the state, as a big loss.

Uduaghan, who said he was shocked by the incident, noted that the deceased was a committed party man and contributed immensely to the growth of APC in the state.

The former governor in a statement signed by his media assistant, Mr. Monoyo Edon, on Sunday said the deceased was a patriot and his death a big blow to the Itsekiri Nation.

He said, “Chief Adolor’s death is depressing to the Itsekiri nation, the All Progressives Congress and Delta State due to his gigantic contributions to the political narrative of not just Delta State but also Nigeria in general.

“I pray that God would strengthen and console his family in this difficult time.

“We miss you Omimi Ejor!”
