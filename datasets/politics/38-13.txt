Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

The Ogun State House of Assembly, on Wednesday, solicited the support of the British High Commission on issues of community engagement and security, among others.

The Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo, made the request while playing host to the British High Commissioner in Nigeria, represented by the Deputy High Commissioner, Lagos, Harriet Thompson, at the Assembly Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta.

Oluomo said the Assembly sought the support of the commission towards promoting and sustaining international economic cooperation and development for the state and the South-West region, while he implored the commission to sustain international engagements with the region.

According to the Speaker, the lawmakers are ready to collaborate with the commission on issues, including support for research in areas that would benefit the community and donor agencies.

He noted that the Assembly under his leadership prioritised cross-fertilisation of ideas, particularly with developed nations.

Oluomo added that he was committed to ensuring human capacity building to establish operational ties with the commission to facilitate seamless exposures for exchange programmes with the British parliament.

Earlier, Thompson said the state had robust engagements with the commission on political and economic issues.

She stated that the commission was open to more diplomatic discussions and engagements to the State and by extension, the nation.
