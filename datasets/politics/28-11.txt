Nobody’ll stop my 2021 Anambra gov bid –Tony Nwoye
Tony Okafor, Awka

The governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress in Anambra State in 2017, Dr Tony Nwoye, has said nobody will stop him from contesting the 2021 governorship election in the state.

Nwonye stated this on Tuesday at the inauguration of a youth foundation in his Nsugbe, Anambra East country home.

He said, “Let me make it clear to all that I’m an unrepentant politician and nobody can stop me from vying for elective positions. The 2021 governorship election is still far. Although the foundation is mainly to assist the youth, it also has political undertones.

“I decided to set up this foundation because the youths assisted me so much in my political career. I’m now 45 years old and no longer a youth, but it is the youths that made me what I am today and that is why I decided to start with them in organising this foundation.

“Many people would be wondering if I will still contest election and my answer is yes. After the youths, I will invite the women and men. I will contest election after weighing the options. The Anambra election is still far, but we hope that God will identify who will put smiles on the faces of Anambra people.”
