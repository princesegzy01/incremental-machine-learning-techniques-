AbdulRazaq to complete Kwara projects
Dayo Ojerinde

Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has said his administration will complete ongoing projects in the state.

The governor spoke though his deputy, Kayode Alabi, at the Kwara State Government House while receiving the Emir of Ilorin, Dr Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari.

AbdulRazaq said, “The Government House we inherited needs urgent rehabilitation as many parts of it are just not fit for habitation. This is reflective of the general decay in public infrastructure statewide.

“We cannot prioritise the rehabilitation of my office and neglect urgent matters like lack of potable water, bad roads, unpaid gratuities, and the comatose state media, especially Radio Kwara, among others,” AbdulRazaq said.

The governor said his administration had begun tackling pressing issues in the state, including fixing three major water facilities across the three senatorial districts.
