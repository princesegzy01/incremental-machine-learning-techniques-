I was shocked Buhari didn’t reappoint me — Shittu
The immediate-past Minister of Communication Mr Adebayo Shittu, said he was shocked when his name was not included on President Muhammadu Buhari’s ministerial list.

Shittu, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria in Abuja, said although he did not expect that he would not be reappointed.

He added, however, that as a muslim, he took it as his fate.

He said “Of course, I expected that I will be reappointed (as minister) but when it didn’t happen, as a Muslim, it didn’t take me five minutes before I accepted that what has come, it’s the will of God.

“And I have also found comfort in a Quranic verse when God promised that what is to come later is better than what is with you now.

The ex-minister, who is a legal practitioner, said he had decided to fallback to his profession.
