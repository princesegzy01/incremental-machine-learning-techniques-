A former Minister of Youths and Sports, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi, has lamented the hardship in the country.

Abdullahi spoke during his 50th birthday anniversary held at his residence in Ilorin on Tuesday, adding said a lot of people in the country who had opportunity to be successful in life refused to let other people benefit from them.

Abdullahi recalled that “In 1988, somebody whom I did not share blood relationship with gave me N40 and afforded me the opportunity to take the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board examination for admission into university.

He said, “I am a Muslim from Ilorin in Kwara State and this benefactor is a Christian and an Ekiti man from the then Ondo State.”

The former minister advised that the people of the country should promote brotherly love which would encourage them to share opportunities that could check poverty and aid development of the nation, adding that he would soon inaugurate a N50m endowment fund to provide opportunities for young people in the state on the matters of education and basic health care.”
