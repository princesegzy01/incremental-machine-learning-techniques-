Three Certificates of Return still with us – INEC
Friday Olokor, Abuja

The Independent National Electoral Commission has said three Certificates of Return are still pending to be issued for the Oju Obi Federal Constituency of Benue State and two state constituencies in Niger and Akwa Ibom states.

INEC National Commissioner and Chairman in charge of Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, who stated this in an interview with The PUNCH, said until all the issues before the Election Petitions Tribunals were resolved, the commission would continue to withdraw and re-issue Cs o R.

He said, “As of today, the commission has not issued a Certificate of Return to anybody in relation to the Oju Obi Federal Constituency in Benue State. Also as of today, INEC has not issued a Certificate of Return in relation to a state constituency in Niger State and another one in Akwa Ibom State.

“These are the three, but in relation to senatorial elections, the commission has issued all certificates of return.

“But you know, this thing is an ongoing exercise; if the Federal High Court has asked us to issue a certificate of return and we complied, and the case goes to the Court of Appeal, and the appellate court reverses it, we will withdraw and re-issue.”
