Success Nwogu, Abuja

No fewer than 29 out of the 34 former governorship aspirants from Kogi and Bayelsa states during the November 3 primary of the Peoples Democratic Party have expressed support for the PDP National Reconciliation Council led by former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, The PUNCH has learnt.

It was also gathered that they were hopeful that the council would address their grievances and reconcile them so that the party would be more united for the November 16 governorship elections in the states.

The PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, had inaugurated the council to reconcile former aspirants and PDP members in the two states who were aggrieved following the outcome of the primaries.

One of the former aspirants from Bayelsa State, Tariela Oliver, in an interview with our correspondent, said no fewer than 19 former aspirants from the state had accepted to be reconciled and were already working for the victory of the party in the state.

Oliver stated that reconciliation had already commenced in the state, adding that the Saraki’s council was a welcome development.

Oliver said, “We believe the Saraki Reconciliation Council will reconcile all the aggrieved aspirants and party members. Even at the state level, they started the reconciliation immediately after the election. Bringing somebody like Bukola Saraki into the picture right now is the best thing the party has done and I believe that it will be very successful.”
