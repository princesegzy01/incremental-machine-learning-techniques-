I remain AA National Chairman, Anifowose-Kelani insists
Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The National Chairman of the Action Alliance, Dr Tunde Anifowose-Kelani, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission to stop Chief Kenneth Udeze and Vemimbe James from parading themselves as the National Chairman and National Secretary of the party, respectively.

He also warned the INEC against recognising Mohammed Abubakar and Mr El Moses as acting National Chairman and acting National Secretary of the party.

Anifowose-Kelani, in a letter to INEC through his lawyer, Mr Olaniyi Okin, a copy of which was made available to our correspondent on Sunday, said he remained the authentic national chairman of the party.

He said this followed his election at the party’s convention “properly organised and held on 13th of April, 2013, under the supervision of INEC for a four-year term which is renewable for another four years, in accordance with the constitution of the party.” Anifowose-Kelani said in the letter that the report that Alhaji Mohammed Abubakar and Mr El Moses were appointed as acting National Chairman and acting National Secretary, respectively, was untrue.

“We wish to advise that the cause of action in the pending suit in the Federal High Court, Abuja, is about the chairmanship position of the party.

“Our client was not allowed to complete his tenure as the elected national chairman of the party before he was overthrown in the most fraudulent and unconstitutional manner by virtue of a letter of leave of absence which he never wrote as prescribed by the party’s constitution,” the letter read.
