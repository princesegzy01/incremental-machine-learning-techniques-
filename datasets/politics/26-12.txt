Osun asks Aregbesola’s appointees to vacate official quarters
Bola Bamigbola, Osogbo.

Osun State Government has directed political appointees that served in the immediate past administration that were reappointed to vacate official quarters with immediate effect.

A letter signed by T.A. Agunlejika, Coordinating Director, Bureau of General Services, dated October 9, obtained by our correspondent on Friday, also said some ex-appointees harboured illegal occupants in some of the flats.

Agunlejika said the occupants of the flats must quit to allow renovation work to be carried out before new functionaries would be given the flats.

The letter reads, “In preparation for the inauguration of new Commissioners/Special Advisers and appointment of other political functionaries, there is the need to renovate the quarters and then after allocating appropriately.”
