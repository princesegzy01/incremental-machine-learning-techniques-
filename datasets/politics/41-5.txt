Bayelsa/Kogi primaries: Groups lament low female participation
Friday Olokor, Abuja

A coalition of women organisations have protested against the low participation of women in the primaries of Bayelsa and Kogi states governorship elections scheduled for November 19, and demanded an end to the trend.

The women noted that the non-emergence of a woman as a leading governorship candidate in both states did not mean well for democracy in Nigeria.

The PUNCH reported out of the 64 parties that conducted primaries and were monitored by the Independent National Electoral Commission in Bayelsa State, only seven females emerged as candidates.

In Kogi State, 59 parties conducted primaries that were also monitored by INEC with only four females among the candidates.

The women groups in separate interviews with our correspondent explained that the low participation was “a reduction in the national scale, the dismal number of women in elective office in Nigeria.”

The Executive Director of the Cece Yara Foundation, Grace Ketefe, said, “The tradition of low participation by women is entrenched in our polity: it doesn’t just start with the Bayelsa or Kogi party primaries for November 16 governorship election .

“The reason is historical and cultural; there are multiple ways to tackle it. The first is the need for demonetisation of the political process. The militarisation of election in Nigeria is another significant factor that discourages women. Women’s free participation cannot thrive where we have harvest of bloodshed and loss of lives.”

The Chief Executive of Nigeria Women Trust Fund, Hajiya Mufuliat Fijabi, urged political parties to close the gap.
