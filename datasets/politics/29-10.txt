The Special Adviser on Power Development to the Governor of Bayelsa State, Mr Michael Ogiasa, has resigned his appointment in the administration of Governor Seriake Dickson.

Ogiasa, who is a kinsman of former President Goodluck Jonathan from Otuoke community, announced his resignation in a letter addressed to the Secretary to the State Government.

The tacit letter, dated October 4, 2019, did not give reasons for Ogiasa’s resignation.

He said, “I hereby resign from the Office of Special Adviser to the Governor of Bayelsa State on Power Development.

“I wish to also use this opportunity to thank His Excellency, Hon. Seriake Dickson, for giving me the opportunity to serve Bayelsa State in the above capacity.”

Similarly, the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ward 8 of the Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, Mr Intelligent Owei, has defected to the All Progressives Congress with his supporters.

Owei, who was received by the APC chairman in Akassa Kingdom, Mr Reuben Tamuno, promised to work assiduously with his supporters “to defeat the PDP in our ward, come November 16, when the governorship election will take place.”
