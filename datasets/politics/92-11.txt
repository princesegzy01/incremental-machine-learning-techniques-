NASS: Appeal Court orders re-hearing of Ogun PDP petitions
Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

An Appeal Court sitting in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, has set aside the ruling of the Ogun State Election Petitions Tribunal, upholding the victory of the candidates of the All Progressives Congress, for the Ogun East Senatorial District and the Ijebu Central House of Representatives.

Senator Lekan Mustapha and Kolapo Osunsanya have been declared as winners of both National Assembly seats in the 2019 general elections in the state.

The PDP candidates, Taiwo Shote and Sosanwo Ayoola for the House of Representatives and the senatorial district, respectively, had approached the tribunal to challenge the results declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission. In their separate petitions, they had prayed to be declared winners of the two positions.
