The Governor of Bayelsa State, Seriake Dickson, has forwarded the names of five new commissioner-nominees to the state House of Assembly for screening and possible confirmation.

It was gathered on Thursday that Dickson sent the names to the House of Assembly via a letter addressed to the Speaker, Tonye Isenah.

The nominees include two former members of the House, Peter Akpe and Daniel Igali, who is currently the President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation.

Others are Ebitei Tonyon, Dumbo Alex and Churson Obosi.

The commissioner-nominees will appear before the 24-member House on Friday for screening.
