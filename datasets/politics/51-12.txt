Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

The erstwhile Chief of Staff to the Kogi State governor, Edward Onoja, has been nominated as the running mate to Governor Yahaya Bello in the November 16 governorship election.

Bello emerged as the candidate of All Progressive Congress at the party’s primary on August 29.

Sources told our correspondent on Sunday in Lokoja that the national secretariat had cleared Onoja to be the running mate to Bello

Although Onojas pictures have always appeared with Bello’s in all posters in the run up to the party primary, it was gathered that the arrangement was only approved on Friday after the meeting of the APC Chairman, Adams Oshiomole with President Mohammadu Buhari.

The Director General, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Kingsley Fanwo, said he had yet to be briefed.

“I think it’s true but I have not been officially briefed “ Fanwo said.
