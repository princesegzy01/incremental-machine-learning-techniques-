Ganduje submits Kano cabinet nominees
Ted Odogwu, Kano

Five months after keeping Kano in suspense, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has submitted the names of his constituted cabinet, in which he retains some of his former commissioners.

According to a source within the state government circles, some old commissioners are among those retained, including Muhammad Garba (Information), Dr Kabir Getso, (Health), Murtala Garo (Local Government), and Musa Iliyasu Kwankwaso (Rural Development).

Others are Ibrahim Mukhtar (Justice), Alhaji Shehu Na’Allaah (Budget and Planning) and Ahmed Rabi’u (Commerce).

In addition, the source said the governor had already forwarded the names of the nominees to security agencies, including the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency for screening to ascertain their zero tolerance for drugs.

The source said, “In fact, the nominees have scaled through the basic screening. The personal screening of the nominees have already commenced at the time of filing this report.”

When contacted, the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Abba Anwar, said he was neither aware of any list nor the names of those retained.
