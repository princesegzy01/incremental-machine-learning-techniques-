APC belongs to us, we’re going nowhere – Obaseki
Sola Shittu, Benin

The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has reaffirmed that he had no plans to leave the All Progressives Congress.

The governor said this when he received members of the Godwin Obaseki Support Group, who paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House in Benin City on Wednesday.

“If a handful of individuals start misbehaving and feel we will leave the party for them, they will be the ones to leave,” he said.

Obaseki described the APC as a party for the youths and the next generation, saying his administration was focused on infrastructural and institutional reforms that would stand the test of time.

He said, “This is a government of real change, which is concerned about youth empowerment and the future. This government has performed beyond people’s expectations and we are proud of the things we have done so far.”

Obaseki who commended the GOSG for its commitment to supporting his administration, urged members of the group to intensify activities in the state and collaborate with other groups with the same ideology.

The governor urged the group to collaborate with the state government in the campaign to kick out thuggery in the state.

Earlier, the Director General of the group, Mr Henry Idogun, expressed support for the governor’s second-term bid.
