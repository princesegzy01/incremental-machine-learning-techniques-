Ogun portal: Abiodun pledges jobs
Tunji Bosun, Abeokuta

The Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, has pledged that instant employment letters would be issued to some lucky applicants on the state job portal.

This was contained in a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Kunle Somorin, on Tuesday.

The governor said he would formally launch the job portal on Thursday.

The portal had crashed a few days after it was opened last month.

Abidoun said the public presentation would take place at the June 12 Cultural Centre, Kuto, Abeokuta.

He said, “The job portal which is under review, recorded over 5,000 candidates when a test-run was done last month for only two hours.

“The response underscored the enthusiasm of citizens to the government’s job creation initiative.”
