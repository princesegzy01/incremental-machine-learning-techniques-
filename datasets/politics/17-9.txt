‘INEC borrowed 2,500 card readers for Bayelsa poll’
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

the Independent National Electoral Commission said on Wednesday that it had borrowed about 2,500 smart card readers from its office in Rivers State to support the conduct of the governorship election in Bayelsa State.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner in charge of Bayelsa State, Monday Tom Udoh, disclosed this while speaking during a stakeholders’ meeting organised by the Nigeria Police Force at the Police Officers’ Mess in Yenagoa for the November 16 governorship poll in the state.

However, the Peoples Democratic Party and the All Progressives Congress were not represented at the police forum.

Udoh, who was represented by INEC’s Administrative Secretary in the state, Edwin Enabor, said the commission had over 2,230 card readers originally meant for Bayelsa State before the additional 2,500 card readers were borrowed from Rivers State.

The Bayelsa REC, who assured the stakeholders that the commission was 90 per cent ready to conduct the poll, said “We had to borrow. We have borrowed close to 2,500 smart card readers from Rivers State while what we have is 2,240 smart card readers in this state, which we have in our possession.

“But we made sure we went to Rivers State and took additional 2,000 plus (smart card readers). So, the issue of card readers will be taken care of. We intend this time to get it right.”
