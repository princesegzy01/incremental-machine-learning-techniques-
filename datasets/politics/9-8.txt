Bayelsa election: Dickson presents Diri to Jonathan
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

The Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, says he and the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party will present the party’s governorship candidate, Senator Douye Diri, and his running mate, Senator Lawrence Ehwrudjakpo, to former President Goodluck Jonathan.

Dickson, who stated this in a statement on Sunday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Fidelis Soriwei, said the move was “a mark of respect” for Jonathan.

Dickson, according to the statement, said the decision to present Diri and Ewhrudjakpo to Jonathan was due to the “high respect” he had for him as a leader.

The governor, who made the statement when the Ogbia Restoration Caucus visited him for an interactive session on Sunday, said the presentation of Diri and Ewhrudjakpo would take place at the earliest convenience of the former President.
