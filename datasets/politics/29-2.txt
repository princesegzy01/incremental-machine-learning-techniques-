The Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, on Tuesday, submitted 17 names of commissioner nominees to the state House of Assembly for screening and confirmation.

The long-awaited list comes more than four months after the governor took the oath of office for a second term.

In a letter read on the floor of the House by the Speaker, Abdullahi Wuse, the governor said the submission of the list was in line with Section 192 Subsection 1 of the 1999 constitution as amended.

The nominees included Nasara Dan Mallam, Zakari Abubakar, Haliru Jikantoro, Abdul Malik Sarkin Daci, Mukhtar Nasaleh, Ramatu Yardua, Ibrahim Panti and Hannatu Saleh.

Others were Mustapha Jibrin, Yusuf Suleiman, Emmanuel Umar, Mohammed Idris, Tanko Zakari, Sunday Kolo, Haruna Dukku, Mamman Musa and Maku Sidi.

Also, eight of the 17 nominees were returnees, having served in the first tenure of Belloâ€™s administration.

The House said it would consider the list at its next executive session before fixing a date for the screening of the nominees.
