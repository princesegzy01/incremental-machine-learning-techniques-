Tribunal upholds Ayade’s victory, sacks lawmaker, orders rerun
Ada Wodu, Calabar

The governorship election petition tribunal sitting in Cross River State on Thursday declared Governor Ben Ayade, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, as winner of the March 9, 2019 governorship election in the state.

The Chairman of the three-man tribunal, Justice Josiah Majebi, dismissed all the pleas of the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Senator John Owan-Enoh, saying the petition was a pre-election matter and the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to entertain it.

“The petition failed and is accordingly dismissed. We hereby found that Prof Ben Ayade is duly elected as Governor of Cross River State in the March 9, 2019 governorship election,” Justice Majebi said after dismissing all the prayers of the petitioner.

Senator Owan-Enoh had asked the tribunal to, among others, declare that he was unlawfully excluded from the election and that he was validly nominated by his party to contest and that the declaration of Ayade as winner of the election was wrongful and a fresh election must be conducted.

Also, the election petitions tribunal sitting in Calabar sacked a member of the Cross River State House of Assembly for Abi State Constituency, Dr David Etta of the PDP and ordered a rerun.

The Chairman of the tribunal, Justice A. A. Babawale, declared the election of Etta null and void, while ruling on a petition by the candidate of the APC, Iwara Inah, in the election.
