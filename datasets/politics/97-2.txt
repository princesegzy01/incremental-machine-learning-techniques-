Under cross-examination, by respondents’ lawyers, Maijigiri said contrary to the results declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission, the results collated by his party in the state showed that APC polled 872,000 while PDP scored 905,000.

The results INEC declared for the state, however, showed that PDP polled 160,203 votes while the APC polled 1,505,633.

Contradicting INEC’s results, Maijigiri said,”We (PDP) are the one who won the election not APC.

“APC scored 872,000 and PDP scored, 905,000.

“These are our own results, we collated in our state not the ones from the server.”
