PDP loses petition against ex-Nasarawa gov
Umar Muhammed, Lafia

The Election Petitions Tribunal in Lafia, Nasarawa State, has struck out the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party challenging former Governor Tanko Al-Makura’s victory in the March 9 Nasarawa South senatorial election.

The candidate of the PDP for the election, Suleiman Adokwe, had approached the tribunal to nullify Al-Makura’s election, saying the Independent National Electoral Commission didn’t comply with the Electoral Act in declaring the All Progressives Congress candidate the winner of the polls.

Adokwe also alleged intimidation and electoral fraud by the APC.

But the Chairman of the tribunal, Justice David Ugoh, who read the unanimous judgment on Friday, declared that the petition lacked merit.

Ugoh said the petitioner failed to prove that the respondent did not score the highest lawful votes cast in the election.

He added that the petitioner also failed to prove non-compliance with the Electoral Act, how voters were prevented from voting and how the results of the election were illegally cancelled.

He said, “We, therefore, uphold the result declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission.”

While expressing dissatisfaction over the judgment, counsel for Adokwe said they would study the ruling and decide on the next line of action.
