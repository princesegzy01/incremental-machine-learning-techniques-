Armstrong Bakam, Bauchi

The Commissioner for Finance, Bauchi State, Nura Manu Soro, has resigned his position barely 40 days after he was sworn into office.

Soro was sworn in by Governor Bala Mohammed at the Multipurpose Indoor Sports Hall on September 6, along with 19 others.

He however announced his resignation in a terse message posted on his WhatsApp status, on Wednesday.

Although Soro did not give any reason for his resignation, he promised to issue a statement later.

He said, “I’ve resigned my position as Commissioner of Finance and member of the Bauchi State Executive Council. I’ll issue a press release on the situation later InshaAllah.”

The former commissioner did not pick several calls made to his mobile phone and had yet to return them as of the time of filing this report.

Meanwhile, few hours after Soro’s resignation, the Bauchi State Government announced a minor reshuffle of the State Executive Council, which included Soro.

The Commissioner for Information, Dr Ladan Salihu, in a statement, said, “Governor Bala Mohammed has approved the reshuffling of the following commissioners: Nura Manu Soro from Ministry of Finance to Ministry of Youth and Sports and Umar Adamu from Ministry of Water Resources to Ministry of Finance.”

Also, Jidauna Tula was moved from the Ministry of Cooperatives to Ministry of Water Resources, while Usman Saleh was transferred from Ministry of Youth and Sports to the Ministry of Small and Medium Scale Enterprises.
