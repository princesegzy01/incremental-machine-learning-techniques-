Ademola Babalola, Ibadan

The Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, has inaugurated a 10-man committee to review government projects and contracts from 2017 to 2019.

The period covers the last two years of former Governor Abiola Ajimobi’s eight years tenure.

The committee headed by the state chairman, Nigerian Society of Engineers, Damola Fatila, was inaugurated at the executive council chambers of the Governor’s Office, Ibadan, on Monday.

Makinde urged the committee to discharge its mandate without favour and verify contractors who claimed to have completed their projects.

The governor, who promised not to interfere with the committee’s functions, enjoined it to inspect ongoing/uncompleted projects, ascertain their financial implications and advise government appropriately.

Makinde said, “Emphasis should be placed on significant of the projects for the overall interest of the people.”

He said the committee had four weeks to submit its report.

Fatila assured Makinde that the committee would work in line with its mandate.
