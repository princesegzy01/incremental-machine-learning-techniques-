Appeal court upholds Osun lawmaker’s election
Peter Dada, Akure

The Court of Appeal sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Thursday, affirmed the victory of a member of the House of Representatives from Osun State, Mr Bamidele Salam, of the Peoples Democratic Party.

Salam, who represents Ede North/, Ede South/ Egbedore/ Ejigbo Federal constituency of Osun State in the House of Representatives, was declared winner of the House of Representatives’ election, held in February 2019, by the Independent National Electoral Commission.

His victory was however challenged by the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Mr Adejare Bello, at the election petitions tribunal in Osogbo which ordered for fresh election in some polling units of the federal constituency.

Not satisfied with the verdict of the lower court, Salam proceeded to the appellate court to challenge the tribunal judgement.

In a unanimous judgment, read by Justice Muhammed Danjuma, the court dismissed the decision of the election petitions tribunal and declared Salam the winner of the election.
