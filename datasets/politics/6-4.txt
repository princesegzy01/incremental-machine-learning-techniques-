My official vehicle is over 16 years – Yahaya
Chima Azubuike, Gombe

The Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, says the only functional vehicle in his convoy is over 16 years.

He stated this on Wednesday at the inauguration of 50 fifty new Toyota Hiace buses for commercial transport.

He noted that out greed and lack of service to humanity by the previous administration made them to sell vehicles estimated at over N300m for N11m.

“The vehicle that brought me to this place was purchased some 16 years, during Goje era; that is the only functional vehicle of a governor. Because of greed, avarice and lack of service to humanity some people decided to auction functional vehicles in government.

“The governor’s vehicle that is worth N300m was taken away for N11m. I’m happy to say some have returned the vehicles. I will ensure that whatever is taken out illegally is returned to Gombe State. “ he said.

The Managing Director of Gombe Transport Corporation, Alh Umar Abdulsalam, said the measures put in by the governor would turn the corporation around for better.
