Observer group alleges voter inducement in Kogi, Bayelsa
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

As the November 16 governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states draw closer, an observer group, YIAGA Africa, has filled a report of voter inducement in both states.

In a report released on Thursday in Lokoja, YIAGA said voter inducement was reported in at least one in every three of the 21 local government areas in Kogi State.

The report also showed that inducement was taking place in all the LGAs in Bayelsa State.

The observer group said in Bayelsa, it witnessed or heard of cases of voter inducement in Kolokuma/Opokuma, Southern Ijaw, Yenagoa, Brass, Ogbia, Nembe and Sagbama LGAs.

Areas where voter inducement was observed in Kogi were Adavi, Ogori Mangogo, Okehi,Okene, Bassa, Ibaji, Idah, Kabba/Bunu and Kogi/ Koton-Karfe LGA in Kogi State.

The report also revealed that campaign activities were at their lowest ebb as none of the popular political parties in the state seemed not to be engaging voters.

The report said, “WTV Kogi report shows that only 38 per cent, 1 per cent and 23 per cent, of LTOs either witnessed or heard of rallies conducted by the ADC, APC and PDP. In Bayelsa State, 65 per cent, 65 per cent, five per cent and five per cent of LTOs either witnessed or heard of rallies conducted by the ADC, APC, PDP and SDP.”

The report, however, noted increased electoral activities by all stakeholders as Independent National Electoral Commission, political parties, civil society organisations and political associations were building momentum.

YIAGA Africa said, “We will be watching the vote by deploying long-term observers to all LGAs in Kogi and Bayelsa to observe the pre-election environment.”
