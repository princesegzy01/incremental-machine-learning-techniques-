President threatened we’d be sacked for non-performance – Minister
Ihuoma Chiedozie, Abuja

The Minister of Communications, Dr Isa Pantami, on Thursday, said President Muhammadu Buhari told ministers that they would be sacked if they fail to perform.

Pantami spoke at a meeting with the management of the National Information Technology Development Agency.

The communications minister noted that the jobs of the heads of the agencies are also on the line, going by the presidential directive.

“The President has told us that as ministers you can only retain your seat if you deliver, if not you will be sacked.

“So our ability to deliver depends mostly on the agencies under us–if you deliver we will deliver. If you fail we will fail.

“We were all directed that if the agencies under us are not performing we will not be on our seats,” he stressed.

“Very soon, the heads of the agencies would also be issued their own Key Performance Indicators,’’ Pantami said.

“We will put the Chief Executive Officers of the agencies under pressure, and you are to put your directors under pressure,” Pantami added.
