Anambra elders want gov like Obi, Ngige
Tony Okafor, Awka

Anambra State elders under the aegis of the Great Anambra Forum, on Tuesday, said their dream governor in 2021 would be somebody as “altruistic” as ex-governors of the state, Peter Obi and Chris Ngige.

The elders, in a statement by their leader, Fabian Ozoigbo, said a two-month survey showed that the next governor of the state should come from the southern part of the state and must be as resulted-oriented as Obi and Ngige.

Though GARFORUM supported the emergence of the next governor from Anambra South Senatorial District, it said the ability to perform was the key to choosing the person.

The group said it would no longer tolerate what it described as a “foreign governor” to superintend affairs of the state.
