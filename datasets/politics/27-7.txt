Edo APC threatens to expel EPM members
Sola Shittu, Benin

The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Edo State chapter, Mr Anslem Ojezua, on Thursday, again threatened to suspend the Edo Peoples Movement, a caucus of the party, and recommend it for expulsion.

Ojezua stated this after the State Executive Council meeting of the party, which had Governor Godwin Obaseki in attendance.

He said the party would not fail to suspend those forming parallel groups, to strengthen its unity in the state.

The APC chairman said, “In our constitution, we have various punishments for various offences. This one goes with suspension with the possibility of expulsion but it is the National Executive Committee that has the power for expulsion. We can only make recommendations.”

He said the state executive meeting became necessary to checkmate and cut to size those who wanted to cause disaffection within the party and strengthen the fabrics of the party.

“The meeting was to discuss issues of formation of a group within the party and on what the constitution says about that.

“We reached the conclusion that the constitution of the party forbids the formation of a parallel group within the party. It is anti-party, it works to weaken the fabrics of the party and it must be discouraged.

“So we are going to take steps to deal with those issues.”
