Kogi election: YIAGA Africa to deploy 500 observers
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

YIAGA Africa, an observer group, says it has concluded plans to deploy 500 observers to monitor the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State.

The group said the election monitors would be deployed in all the polling units across the 21 local government areas of the state.

The Programme Manager, Cynthia Mbamalu, told journalists at a media round table in Lokoja on Sunday that the objective was to provide timely and accurate information about the election process to voters and stakeholders.

He said the action was part of the group’s strategy to ensure that citizens’ votes count by deterring fraud and manipulation during the conduct of elections and collation of results.

She also said the action would build citizens confidence in the election.

Mbamalu said YIAGA Africa would be collaborating with the Independent National Electoral Commission, security agencies, the media and other stakeholders to mitigate electoral misconduct, which allegedly characterised previous elections.

She said, “We shall be monitoring the build- up to the election across the state, identify flashpoints and work with all stakeholders to ensure that violence during the November governorship election in Kogi is reduced to the barest minimum.”
