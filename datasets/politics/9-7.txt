Bayelsa election: Dickson predicts victory for PDP
Daniels Igoni, Yenagoa

Governor Seriake Dickson of Bayelsa State has led prominent personalities to observe his valedictory state annual thanksgiving service.

Dickson, whose tenure terminates on February 14, 2020, expressed gratitude to God for finding him worthy to be used as an instrument to engender peace, stability and appreciable development for the state.

A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Fidelis Soriwei, said the governor, who spoke at the Ecumenical Centre, Igbogene, Yenagoa, expressed hope that God would not allow those who did not mean well for the state to assume power.

He expressed optimism that the PDP governorship candidate, Senator Douye Diri, would emerge victorious in the November 16 governorship election through a free, fair, peaceful and credible process.

Highlighting some of the achievements of his administration, Dickson said, “Critical infrastructure such as roads, health facilities, airport, educational facilities and public buildings including the ecumenical centre are some of the lofty projects that have elevated the status of Yenagoa.”

In his goodwill message, the General Overseer of the Royal House of Grace International Church, Apostle Zilly Aggrey, described the forthcoming election as “a contest between good and promoters of evil in Bayelsa.”
