The National Independent Electoral Commission has said it is ready for the November 16 governorship election in Kogi State.

The National Commissioner, Hadjia Aminat Zakari, said this on Thursday in a keynote address delivered at the opening of a two-day workshop for state implementers organised by the Election Monitoring and Support Centre, in partnership with the European Centre for Electoral Support.

According to Zakari, the ongoing training workshop is to showcase the commissionâ€™s level of preparedness for the successful conduct of the election.

She said it had become imperative to properly monitor all ad hoc staff through proper documentation and reporting to enable management provide appropriate response to all challenges on the election day.

The INEC commissioner said the workshop was aimed at strengthening the electoral officers knowledge on their role in the forthcoming election.

The National Commissioner in Charge of North/Central, Mallam Haruna Kudu, said, after the training, the 108 affected staff should have become more knowledgeable about their role in proper monitoring on election day.
