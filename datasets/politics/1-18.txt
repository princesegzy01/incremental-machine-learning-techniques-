Announcing the suspension at an enlarged meeting and press briefing held at the residence of Gen.

“For us the authentic APC stakeholders in Edo State, we wholeheartedly denounce such.

“We wish to state that at the appropriate time, the APC National Working Committee will initiate the process of party primaries for the selection of the party’s gubernatorial candidate.

“We will abide by the guidelines for such primaries as the constitution of the party vests the responsibility of conducting primaries on the NWC.

“We are prepared to give every aspirant equal opportunity to test their popularity. We will resist any attempt to close the political space,” Ikahriake said.

“Consequently, we hereby suspend Governor Godwin Obaseki, Hon Phillip Shuaibu and Barr. Osarodion Ogie from the party for anti-party activities and urge the National Working Committee to set the machinery in motion for further disciplinary action against them,” he added.
