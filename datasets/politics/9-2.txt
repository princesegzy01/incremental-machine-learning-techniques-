Kogi group sues for peace ahead of election
Gbenga Odogun, Lokoja

A group, the Kogi Coalition of Umbrella Development Associations, has called on the people of Kogi State to give peace a chance during the November 16 governorship election in the state.

The group is made up of Igala Cultural and Development Association headed by Alhaji Abubakar Sadiq; Ebira Peopleâ€™s Association headed by Dr Adeiza and the Okun Development Association led by Femi Mikikan.

Mikikan, at a press conference on Monday in Lokoja, said the forthcoming governorship election should not be allowed to degenerate as no meaningful development could take place in an atmosphere of violence.

He said the association was formed to douse the tension caused by ethnic polarisation and animosity that always bedevilled the state at every turn of election.

Mikikan said the objective of the association was to complement the efforts of the state government and other bodies to consolidate the gains so far recorded in promoting peace, unity and understanding in the state.
