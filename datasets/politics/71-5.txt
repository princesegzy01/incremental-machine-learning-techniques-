Reps demand NASS approval for FG’s international treaties
Leke Baiyewu, Abuja

The House of Representatives is considering an amendment to the 1999 Constitution that would make it compulsory for the Federal Government to seek the input and approval of the National Assembly before carrying out negotiations on international treaties.

If the National Assembly passed the amendment, Federal Government’s ministries, departments and agencies or officials will not be able to negotiate or enter into bilateral and multilateral deals on behalf of Nigeria without consulting the federal parliament.

The proposed amendment was contained in a bill sponsored by the Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Mr Benjamin Kalu, which passed the first reading in July.

The bill was titled, ‘A bill for an act to alter the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, to provide for the inclusion of the National Assembly in the process of making treaties with other countries; and for other matters connected therewith.’

Kalu said, “The bill seeks to amend section 12 of the constitution. It is timely because of the current African trade treaty which like various others (above 300) will first go through domestication process before implementation.

“Out of this number, only 65 have been able to make it through the process. An easier exercise with an early engagement of the legislature especially during negotiations is what the amendment in summary seeks.”
