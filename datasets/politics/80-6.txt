Friday Olokor, Abuja

A former Chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Attahiru Jega, has said that he joined the Peoples Redemption Party because he remains a disciple of its founder, the late Mallam Aminu Kano.

The former President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities during the military administration of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida presently teaches Political Science at Bayero University, Kano.

He was told by The PUNCH to confirm a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the PRP, Abdul Gombe, that he had joined the party to chair the Committee of its Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threat Analysis.

The choice of Jega was ratified during the 62nd National Executive Committee meeting of the PRP held in Kaduna on June 22.
