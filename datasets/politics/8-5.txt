Don’t steal public money, Ribadu advises public servants
Chima Azubuike, Gombe

A former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nuhu Ribadu, has admonished commissioners designate, special assistants and permanent secretaries to make personal commitments not to tamper with public funds.

Ribadu said this while delivering a keynote presentation on anti-corruption and good governance at the commencement of a two-day retreat in Gombe on Monday.

According to Ribadu, corruption is the cause of “our underdevelopment, lack of power and the reason Nigerian citizens are still poor.”

He added, “Make personal vows not to steal public funds. You can’t stop corruption in the police when the civil service is still corrupt. Stop corruption and see what will happen in society. Corruption erodes trust in leadership. A leader with soiled hands has no moral right to question his subordinates.”

The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, also said for the Gombe State Government to succeed in internal security, it must work closely with traditional institutions.

Mustapha said, “Let me urge the government of Gombe State to work closely with traditional institutions for the purpose of entrenching the policies of the Federal Government in the area of community policing. We must return to it if we have the desire to protect our communities.”

Governor Inuwa Yahaya, in his remarks, scored his government high in three critical sectors.

Yahaya charged the commissioners designate to be prudent, saying, “Water supply has improved in Gombe, as well as the mobilisation of road construction projects and fertiliser supply within the first month of this administration.”
