Seven things women want from men during sex
Many men tend to think that they have all it takes to make a woman orgasm during sex. However, women say there are simple facts they want men to be acquainted with whenever they settle down to have sex.

These are seven of such facts:

Work on your massage skills. Believe it or not, women treasure body massage. Sexologists warn that this is not an absent-minded back-scratching, but a really good, erotic one.

The power of kissing. Nothing turns on a woman more than a solid make-out session, says an Italian escort, Gabriel Lamur. Kissing is like the foreplay to foreplay. It should not be limited to a woman’s lips. “Any woman would appreciate kissing all the parts of her body,” he says. Kiss up and down her back, inside her thighs, the tips of her fingers, etc.

Your orgasm isn’t the main attraction. Take the spotlight off yourself and shift it to her. We’re not saying you can’t orgasm; just don’t make it the priority. Focus solely on her climax.

Trim your groin. Grooming yourself down there demonstrates that you’re doing everything you can to look sexy for her. You may not get a six-pack overnight, but you can shave in the shower. Just be careful.

Engage in foreplay. Foreplay is more about getting her ready, even as it also enables the man to gain good erection. This may go beyond 10 minutes if you want to do a good job.

Match her game. If she’s talking dirty, then you should talk back dirty. If she’s quiet and shy, reassure her. The outcome is best for her if you pick up on her verbal cues and play along.

There’s no “I” in “sex”. You can come alone, but you can’t have actual sex by yourself. It takes two. So, think of every sexual encounter as time for the two of you to communicate, compromise, and come together.
