[PHOTO] Woman finds strange underwear in boyfriend’s room, shames him on Facebook
A woman has disgraced her boyfriend on Facebook, by making a hilarious post of an otherwise angry situation.

The woman, Jessica, had arrived her boyfriend’s home someday, only to discover an underwear that was smaller than her size neatly folded away.

She immediately realised that her man had been cheating on her.

When she confronted her boyfriend, he reportedly swore that he didn’t know how a woman’s underwear traced its way into his apartment.

The angry girlfriend then went ahead to make a post of it, asking whoever owned the black underwear to either call the now ex-boyfriend, or find a way of getting it back.
