How to find your condom size
Many people know that condoms protect from unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections when used properly.

However, recent studies say about 40 per cent of men are wearing the wrong size condom!

When shopping for condoms, many men tend to believe that one size fits all. But this is not true, considering that penis size and width vary from one man to the others. As such, two individual males may not use the same condom size.

For proper protection against risks of STIs and unplanned pregnancy, finding the right size condom is crucial.

Sex experts say condoms come in broad three sizes, and that a condom must never be too tight or too loose when you wear one, otherwise, it may leave make you uncomfortable and exposed to infections.

So, how do you choose the right size? For a start, you need to know your penis size. But if you don’t, you may buy the three sizes and try each of them. You’ll then choose the size that fits you best and stay with it.

Again, if you want to save money, roll a toilet paper and wear it on your erect penis and gauge the fit.

So, here we go…

• Standard fit: Standard fit condoms range between 2.04” (52mm) and 2.13” (54mm) in width and 7.01” (178mm) and 7.9” (200mm) in length, and generally fit those with a penis girth between 4.7” (119mm) and 5.1” (130mm). If there is just enough room after wearing this size, you fit into the medium size category, which accounts for 50 per cent of men.

• Snugger fit: Snugger fit condoms range between 1.77” (45mm) and 2” (50.8mm) in width and 6.7” (170mm) and 7.5” (190mm) in length, and generally fit those with a penis girth below 4.7” (119mm).

If you slide the roll over your erect penis and there is room to spare, then you fit into the smaller size category. Thirty-five per cent of men fall into this group.

Any man who falls into this group must wear the correct condom size to avoid loose condoms that could slip off, putting you and your partner at risk.

• Larger fit: Larger fit condoms range between 2.13” (54mm) and 2.7” (68mm) in width and 7.5” (190mm) and 8.46” (215mm) in length, and generally fit those with a penis girth bigger than 5.1” (130mm).

Here, if the toilet paper roll doesn’t fit, or is too tight, then you fit into the larger condom group. These men may discover that condoms often feel incredibly tight or even painful. This accounts for about 15-20 per cent of the population.
