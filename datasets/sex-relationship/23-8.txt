40 years after, 101-year-old ordered to pay £25,000 to lady he sexually molested
A 101-years-old paedophile who molested a schoolgirl 40 years ago has been ordered to pay £25,000 to the victim as compensation.

Douglas Hammersley’s victim went to cops after his 100th birthday party made local news.

Hammersley, of New Malden, South West London, had admitted three counts of indecent assault against a girl under 14, The SunUK reported.

He was excused from the sentencing hearing at Aylesbury crown court, Bucks, and received two-year suspended prison sentence, placed on the sex offender register and order to pay the compensation.

Judge Francis Sheridan said of the victim, who cannot be named: “To award compensation is wholly unusual in a case like this but the young victim has carried this cross of abuse for year upon year upon year. She has waited a very long time for justice but I hope justice is what she has got.

“She was telling the truth the whole way through, from the first complaint to the last.”
