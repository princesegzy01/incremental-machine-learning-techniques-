How to last longer in bed!
The average man wants to last longer in bed — both for personal pleasure and also to make his woman climax.

However, experts say that such thoughts usually remain an unfulfilled dream for some men, such that the more they try to last longer in bed, the faster they finish.

Professor of sex, Debby Herbenick, gives some tested and proved ways to help you last a little longer during sex!

• Sensation. In general terms, this refers to the idea that you can regulate your own neurophysiology — or the way your body responds to physical sensations, a urologist, Dr. Thomas Walsh, says.

One of the most common ways to last longer in bed is to bring yourself right to the edge of orgasm before stopping all sexual or masturbatory activity until you have your excitement under control.

Practising this technique can teach your brain and body to better control your orgasm response, adds sex therapist, Dr. Emily Morse.

• The squeeze. If you can feel your orgasm coming on, stop and squeeze right below the head of your penis. Apply firm pressure with your thumb and forefinger and focus the pressure on the urethra—the tube running along the underside of the penis, advises Ian Kerner, Ph.D., a sex therapist. The squeeze technique can help you last longer in bed by pushing blood out of the penis and momentarily decreasing sexual tension, which represses the ejaculatory response, Kerner says.

• Ladies first. When you help her finish first—whether with your mouth, your fingers, or a toy—knowing she’s enjoyed an orgasm may relieve some of the pressure you’re feeling to last longer in bed, Kerner says.

• De-sensitizers. There are topical sprays, called “local anesthetics,” that you can apply to your penis to lessen the sensation and keep control, Dr. Walsh says. “When used properly, you can adjust the amount of desensitization with these sprays, and it won’t transfer to your partner,” he adds. But be warned: The lack of sensation could make it difficult for you to stay erect, he says.

• Condom control. Most major condom manufacturers make extra-thick rubbers that act like a slip-on desensitizer for your penis, Morse says, and these can help you last longer in bed. Look for marketing lingo like “extended pleasure” or “performax.”

• Pills. Plenty of men swallow a pill to become erect. Such drugs genuinely help men with premature ejaculation. Check with your pharmacist, Dr. Walsh explains. Warning, though: the drugs shouldn’t be used unless your performance problem is seriously affecting your life, Dr. Walsh says. He advises talking to your doctor to discuss this option.

• Ask an expert. If you feel like you’ve tried everything to have better sex without success, it may be time to discuss your problem with a sexual dysfunction specialist, Dr. Walsh says.
