Seven things women should always do after sex
After sex, there are a few things a woman should do to keep healthy, such as these ones…

• Wipe down with gentle soap and water. Bacteria from the fingers, mouth, and rectum can increase a woman’s chance of developing yeast or bacterial infection after sex, says obstetrics-gynaecologist, Sherry Ross. She recommends using a non-fragrant soap to wash the vagina after sex. Simply take a warm washcloth and gently dab the area with soap and water (or just warm water), moving from front to back. “Internal cleaning (such as douching) isn’t necessary, because the vagina has its own internal wash cycle that keeps it clean and balanced, she adds. So, no douches allowed.

• Soak in the bathtub. Besides making you feel like the pampered sex queen that you are, adding extra virgin coconut oil to a warm bath can help hydrate the skin of the outer vagina and sooth any vaginal swelling or irritation that occurs after sex, says Ross. Again, this reduces your risk of infection, she adds.

• Drink water. You may need to hydrate after a vigorous sex, says Dr. Nicole Scott. Dehydration affects your entire body; so, if your mouth is dry and/or your vagina felt like sandpaper during sex, you definitely need to refuel with water. Right after sex, drink a pint or two of water. That will hydrate you and help flush pesky Urinary Tract Infection-causing bacteria from your bladder.

• Eat probiotic-rich foods. Yogurt and other fermented foods have the same good bacteria that are found in the vagina, says another gynaecologist, Dr. Kelly Kasper. Getting into the habit of snacking on these foods after sex can help to replenish the body’s good bacteria, helping to decrease your risk of yeast infection.

• Don’t wear panties! Once you’re so fresh and so clean-clean, ward off UTIs and other infections by wearing cotton underwear and loose-fitting pyjamas to keep your privates dry — or, better yet, go commando for optimum air circulation. At the very least, avoid nylon underwear and tight-fitting sleepwear, which can trap moisture and help bacteria grow, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

• Pee! The vagina is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria, because of its moist and warm nature. That’s why you must pee within the next 30minutes after sex.

• Note your discomfort during sex. Sometimes, sex can be painful or uncomfortable for a woman. It is therefore important for you to keep a note of when this happens. There are multiple reasons why sex can be painful for women. The most common reason is vagina dryness. Constipation, or muscle spasm can also be responsible; just as deep penetration can also make sex painful, especially if your partner isn’t hard enough. If you regularly feel discomfort during sex, it is better to consult a doctor.
