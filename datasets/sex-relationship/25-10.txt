If your wife has this job, she’s most likely to cheat on you
There can be many factors that contribute to the infidelity of a partner.

Unhappiness, attraction to another person, lack of satisfaction, or even revenge are all possibly reasons for an extramarital relationship.

However, a new research has found that specific traits and occupations can lead men and women to cheat.

Illicit Encounters, a dating site in the UK for married people, researched more than 10,000 profiles to see what were the most common themes.

Around 20 per cent of the women on the website admitted to being lonely and another 27 per cent described themselves as ‘virile,’ implying a strong and underutilised sex drive.

However, the most remarkable outcome was that housewife was the most popular occupation for women on the site, at 20 per cent.

Christian Grant, a spokesman for the site, added that women’s desire to cheat, especially housewives, is compelled by a sense of neglect and longing for something more significant.

Your typical cheating woman isn’t driven by arrogance, ego or lust, but by a sense of loneliness, thanks to a lack of satisfaction in her marriage.

This loneliness is further compounded for housewives, who potentially spend hours alone, only to further be neglected when their husbands come home.

When it comes to men, it is a very different story altogether.

Men who were tall, rich and intelligent are driven to cheat by their own ego, arrogance and lustful tendencies.

Tall, affluent, smart — these men have it all … or at least, they think they can have it all.

They want to have their cake and eat it too, and that includes having as many relationships as they see fit.

Not to mention, as a smart, wealthy and tall man, you’re more likely to be attracting female attention, whether you like it or not, which only serves to fuel their ego and make them consider an affair as a plausible option.
