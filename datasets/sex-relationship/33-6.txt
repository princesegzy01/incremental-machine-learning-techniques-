Lesbians fancy women because ‘men get turned on’ – Study
A controversial new study is suggesting that same-sex attraction or better still lesbianism in women developed because men get turned on by it.

The researchers from the University of Nicosia surveyed a total of 1,509 heterosexual participants for their study. They wanted to know why there is lesbianism. They found out that it could be because men get bothered or hot at the thought of women having sex.

Although people have argued against the outcome of the theories, Menelaos Apostolou, who is the lead researcher on the study defended his theories in an interview with PinkNews.

He said, “My argument in the paper is this: A considerable proportion of men desire same-sex attractions in women, and this is one possible reason why many women have such attractions.

“About half of the men in the sample reported that they would become sexually excited if their opposite-sex partners revealed to them that they experienced same-sex attraction.”

The result of the findings is that 34.3 percent of male respondents would prefer a partner who is attracted “predominantly to members of the opposite-sex but occasionally of the same-sex”.

7.8 percent of women considered in the survey gave the same answer.

The researchers argued that one of the reasons for men being attracted to women who experience same-sex attraction could be to increase their certainty of being the father of a potential child if their partner sleeps with someone else.

“A woman, driven by her sexual desires, may seek sexual contact outside of her long-term intimate relationship.

“When this woman has sex with another woman she does not have sex with another man which translates into same-sex contact reducing the risk of cuckoldry,” the study concluded.

Apostolou, however, agrees there are some limitations to his arguments and accepted that more research needed to be carried out.
