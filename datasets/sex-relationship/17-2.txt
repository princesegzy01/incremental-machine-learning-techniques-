I’ve had 80 affairs with married men, woman boasts
A doctor’s widow has admitted that she’s had affairs with 80 married men following her husband’s death.

Louise Van Der Velde, 43, says she is living every day like it is her last, juggling multiple affairs with numerous lovers.

She said that the weeks after Valentine’s Day are the busiest time for people looking for affairs because people realise they are in ‘dead’ relationships.

Louise, who says she is a sex therapist, has even gone as far as saying that her lovers’ wives know they’re cheating but turn a blind eye because they have gone off sex.

She said: “Traditional marriage counselling often fails because it is based on a model which has not been reformed for 150 years.

“All this ’till death do us part’ nonsense assumes monogamy works for everyone. This is not realistic and not in line with human nature.

“In order for love and passion to re-enter a marriage, there are other ways. This is why living my sex life to the max and educating people about the future of love is my life’s work.

“People should judge less and just have more great sex. You sure as heck can tell the ones who need it most – the ones who are unhappy. Life’s too short to stick to sex with only one partner.”

Mrs Van Der Velde, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said she first started cheating in the last years of her marriage to her late husband who died suddenly aged 34 in March 2004.

“We decided to embark on an open relationship in the last few years before he died. I have carried on the same way ever since.

“His death made me realise you have to seize the day and make the most of every day.

“I am not looking for another husband and I have no interest in a monogamous relationship. I want to meet sexually driven men who are on the same page as me,” she concluded.
