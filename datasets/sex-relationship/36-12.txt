Bizarre facts men didn’t know about the penis!
Based on statistics, roughly 50 per cent of the world’s population have a penis, simply because they are men.

But then, how much do you actually know about the penis, beyond its appearance and functionality?

Experts say surprisingly, there’s a lot more to the male organ than you may think… Such as the following facts!

• Penis is not as straight as we think they are

In fact, scientists say, based on research, the male sex organ is actually bendier than we can imagine! In 1999, researchers at the University Hospital Groningen in The Netherlands carried out a study which looked at couples having penetrative sex under an MRI machine. Apparently, when having sex in the missionary position, the penis can assume the shape of a boomerang, which is perpendicular in shape.

• Sperm is a lot quicker than you think

Obviously, for a spermatozon, once released via ejaculation, there’s no such thing as a prize for second place — apart from death. So, being quick off the mark is key. But, did you know, ejaculate travels at 28 miles per hour, researchers say. That is the safe speed limit in typical residential areas!

• The way penis reacts to erection

The Kinsey Institute conducted a research which found that smaller, flaccid penises generally lengthen at erection by a greater percentage than larger, flaccid penises. This means a smaller penis can grow significantly and comparatively larger when erect. Whereas the flaccid and erect length of a larger penis may not make that much of a difference.
