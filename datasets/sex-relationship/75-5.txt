COZA rape saga: Fatoyinbo’s case not over —Police
Eniola Akinkuotu, Abuja

The Nigeria Police Force says investigation into the allegation of rape leveled against the Senior Pastor of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo, is still on.

The Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, said this during an interview with The PUNCH on Thursday.

Mba was reacting to the judge’s dismissal of a suit instituted against Fatoyinbo by his accuser, Mrs. Busola Dakolo.

Mrs. Dakolo, who is the wife of popular musician, Timi Dakolo, had filed a civil suit before an FCT High Court in Bwari, insisting that the alleged action of the pastor as well as his denial in a statement adversely affected her marital sex life.

She, therefore, demanded “a personal letter of apology” from the cleric to show honest remorse for his misdeeds.

In his ruling, Justice Oathman Musa held that the matter amounted to injustice and an abuse of judicial process; adding that the case was empty and purely sentimental.

Justice Musa said the case was aimed more at cruelty than at obtaining justice.

The court also awarded costs of N1m against Busola Dakolo and held that the fine should have been 10 times more because the court’s time was wasted.

But the Police spokesman told The PUNCH that the court case was a civil one and therefore had no bearing on the Police probe.

Mba said the investigation would continue and the Police would charge Fatoyinbo if he is found culpable.

He said, “The position of the law in Nigeria, which is very clear, is that a criminal investigation and prosecution can run concurrently with a civil litigation.

“Failure in one does not foreclose the other. And so, we are going on with our own case and when we are done, we will keep Nigerians posted.”
