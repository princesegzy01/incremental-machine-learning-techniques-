Couples who sleep naked have a happier relationship —Study
If you and your partner love to sleep naked, chances are that you are happy in your relationship —perhaps even happier than couples you know who sleep wearing pyjamas or some other pieces of clothing!

This is because a new survey has revealed that couples who sleep naked have a happier relationship.

The study from Cotton USA, asked couples what they slept in at bedtime and then asked them to rate how happy they were in their relationship.

The results showed that 57 per cent of those who slept in the nude said they felt happy, compared to 48 per cent of pyjamas wearers, 43 per cent of nightie wearers and a mere 38 per cent of people who wore pants, bum shorts, etc.

Stephanie Thiers-Ratcliffe of Cotton USA said that one of the leading factors for this was that the nakedness encouraged intimacy and openness, thanks to the skin-on-skin contact and the feeling of soft bedding.

Respondents however note that couples who sleep in the nude would always have so much washing to do!
