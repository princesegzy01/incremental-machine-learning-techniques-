What to know when you date an older woman
It is not uncommon to see young men being in relationships with women who are quite older than them, sometimes by up to a decade or more.

Here’s what to know before you start dating a woman who is old enough to be your aunt or… well… mother!

• You are in different stages in your lives, so, she is not likely to always accept your point of view.

• She is very likely to be financially buoyant than you.

• She is likely to make all the decisions, including where to go on vacation or which restaurants to eat at, or which hotel to go for sexual rendezvous.

• She will likely pay for almost everything, such as food, plane tickets, or a night out at a bar.

• She is very independent of you.

• She will never tolerate cheating on your part.

• She doesn’t see much of a future with you, so, she lives for the moment.

• Because of the age difference, you’re not likely to have anything in common.

• Don’t expect her children to like or welcome you.

• Expect to frequently hear a question like, “Is he your son?”

• She is very likely to dictate the pace in bed.
