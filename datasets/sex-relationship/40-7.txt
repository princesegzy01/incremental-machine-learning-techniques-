People with type ‘O’ blood have better erections —Researchers
To start with, blood is an important component of your erection: If there’s not enough blood flowing to your penis, you won’t be able to have — much less sustain — rock-hard erection.

Now, experts are saying that your blood type affects how easy or how hard you may find it to get and sustain erection.

Researchers from Turkey say that men with type O blood are significantly less likely to have erectile dysfunction than those with type A, type B, or type AB blood.

In fact, guys with type A and type B blood are said to be about four times as likely to suffer from erectile dysfunction than men with type O blood.

They also say that men with type AB blood are nearly five times likely to find it hard to get hard!

Indeed, scientists have previously determined that some blood types — particularly AB — have been linked to other health conditions, including heart disease, higher cholesterol, and blood clots.
