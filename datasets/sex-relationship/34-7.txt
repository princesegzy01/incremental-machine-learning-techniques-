Six different ways to have sex on the table
When it comes to table top sex, the positions are as varied as the layers of onions.

The following are the different ways to have sex on the table!

• Classic doggie style

Have her stand in front of the table and bend over so that her upper half is lying on the table. Depending on how she likes it, grab her from the hair, waist, or hips and spread her legs apart with yours. This is a classic and great position that requires a minimum amount of effort while giving you both the maximum amount of pleasure!

• Sneak a peek/amazing butterfly

Have her lie down on her back on the table with her butt hanging slightly off the edge. Put her legs over your shoulders and hold on tight. She loves it because you will achieve perfect thrusting capability; this means you go deeper and harder! He loves it because he gets to watch every single second of the show.

• Laying down scissors

She lies down on her back on the table and crosses her legs over your shoulders. This way, she will be tighter on you when you thrust, feeling every move on her clitoris.

• The leg lock/leg wrap

She sits on table and wraps her legs around him. This obviously works best on a table that is about waist height of the male partner. As soon as she wraps her legs tightly around you, put your hands on her lower back and pull her toward you with every thrust.

• The erotic V

Have her sit down on the edge of a table. She puts her arms around his neck and then her legs on his shoulders. He holds onto her as she leans back. The rest is up to you.

• The standing wheelbarrow

She stands at a table and lies on top, with half of her body on the table. Standing behind her, he picks up her legs and wraps them around his waist like a wheelbarrow.
