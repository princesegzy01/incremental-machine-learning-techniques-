Seven ways men can be ready for sex any time
Your daily behaviours play a big role in whether your erection can rise to the occasion every time.

Of course, sometimes, problems with your erection aren’t exactly your fault, as experts agree that genetics and certain health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease can make it hard to get erection.

However, a urologist, Dr. Ryan Berglund, says in order to get uncompromising blood flow to your penis to enable you get a healthy erection, do the following:

• Wake up with coffee: Your beverage of choice in the morning can play a role in how well you perform in the bedroom later that night. Research from the University of Texas Health Science Centre at Houston found that men who consumed the caffeine equivalent of two to three cups of coffee a day were less likely to report erectile dysfunction issues than guys who don’t drink coffee. The study authors say that caffeine has properties similar to Viagra, and the stimulant helps the arteries in your penis to relax and your blood flow to increase — both factors necessary for a strong erection.

• Sweat it out. Yes, exercise is not only good for your heart — your penis benefits, too. Berglund says men who do regular aerobic exercise tend to have healthier blood vessels — which are crucial for erections — than overweight, sedentary men. And the more intensely you exercise, the better your penis health seems to be, as noted in The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Exercise may help your body create a compound called nitric oxide, which helps you get and maintain an erection, the study authors told us.

• Eat plenty berries, oranges, apples, pears and drink red wine. According to a study from the UK of over 25,000 men, those who ate more than three servings a week of berries, oranges, red wine and apples, were 19 percent less likely to develop erectile dysfunction over the 10-year follow up than men who didn’t eat them. This is because compounds called flavonoids — which are abundant in these foods — can improve blood flow by making your arteries more flexible, in turn, helping your penis, the study authors say.

• Stop smoking. Whatever’s bad for your heart is bad for your penis. So, quitting smoking is the way to go. In a study of over 2,800 smokers, researchers from Iran discovered that 25 percent of men who quit smoking reported an improvement in their erections within one year. In comparison, none of the guys who continued smoking experienced erection improvement — and seven percent of current smokers said their erections actually got worse during that year. Cigarettes’ main ingredient, nicotine, is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it impairs the ability of the arteries in the penis to dilate, explains Dr. Berglund. And when blood flow to your penis is compromised, so is your erection.

• Relax. Stress is a serious sex-killer. Not only do stress hormones like cortisol inhibit your body’s ability to get an erection, but stress has a way of squashing intimacy, a huge part of a successful sexual intercourse, says Dr. Berglund. The higher levels of cortisol men had, the lower their scores were on tests of sexual functioning, which includes things like how confident they were they could get an erection, how often their erections were hard enough for penetration, and how often was it difficult to maintain an erection during sex, a study from Japan found.

• Stop alcohol. Booze might make you feel like you’re a sex machine; but your penis will tell you differently. That’s because alcohol messes with the nerve function that creates an erection, explains Dr. Berglund. It’s also a depressant, which means by the time you think you’ll be roaring and ready, you’ll likely simply be exhausted.

• Take care of your teeth. What’s going on in your mouth can affect your erection: Men with periodontal disease — or gum disease caused by a build-up of plaque — are about twice as likely to have erectile dysfunction than men with healthier gums, a review from Nature concluded. “Poor dental hygiene has been linked to increased inflammation in the body and with cardiovascular disease risk,” says Dr. Michos. That’s because chronic inflammation can damage the delicate cells in the inside of your blood vessels, which are critical for proper erectile function.
