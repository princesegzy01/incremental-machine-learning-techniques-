[VIDEO] 10 countries where prostitution is legal
On Wednesday, sex workers in Nigeria made another plea for legal recognition in the country.

The National Coordinator of the association, Amaka Enemo, said decriminalising prostitution will curb the spread of HIV remarkably.

She made the submission in Abuja during an interview with journalists at the presentation of a report titled, ‘Understanding the High Risk of Urban Sexual Networks in Nigeria.’

Enemo said that HIV infection has continued to increase because the government treats prostitution as a crime.

She said this leaves prostitutes vulnerable to law enforcement agents, especially the police who constantly harass sex workers and sometimes demand sex without using condoms.

Many agree with her position. In facts, there are many countries in which the trade, sometimes referred to as the oldest in human history, is legal.

Below is a video showing 10 of such countries.
