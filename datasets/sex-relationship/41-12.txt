Nine things women do when they know they’re going to have sex
Spontaneous sex is one of the best feelings in the world, but there are also benefits to knowing in advance that you’re going to have sex.

While men hardly care about certain things the way women do, women love to prepare – especially when it comes to sleeping with someone new. This includes everything from doing a thorough bath to picking out sexy lingerie.

Here are some things women do when they know sex is coming…

• Shave/wax. Just to secure that smooth-like-skill touch, women sometimes go for waxing, especially those who are hairy. This makes their skin soft to touch and… well … sexy!

• Paint toenails. The idea is, “if a guy is going to see my feet, then I’ll at least make sure I have a nice nail polish on.”

• Briefly panic. Even if she had sex just days earlier, there’s always that brief panic that she’s going to do it wrong, as if sex has changed completely within 24 hours! Sexologists say, “There’s always that bit of panic, but more often than not, it turns into anticipation, which is nice.”

• Wearing sexiest lingerie. Need we say more?

• Spend ages deciding on an outfit. Even when that outfit will soon come off, women still give it some thought. They want to wear something classy, but also enticing, and nothing that has lots of zips and buttons!

• Wondering whether to bring condoms. One big worry is, “Will it look too forward if I bring condoms? If I don’t bring any, will it look bad on me to expect the guy to have some?” Sex experts say there’s never an easy answer for this; but at the end of the day, it’s better to be safe than sorry.

• Text their friends. Sure, women almost always text their friends for advice, never mind how long they’ve been in the game!

• Make a mental list of things to pack for the ‘morning after.’ Things like mints, a toothbrush, some makeup and some clean lingerie.

• Have a glass of wine, or two. This normally consists of a glass of wine while getting ready, followed by another one before leaving just to help ease the nerves.
