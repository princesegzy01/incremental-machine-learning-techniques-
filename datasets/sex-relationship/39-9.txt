The sexting codes every parent must know!
Yes, it’s the tech age and the average parent gushes at their child’s ability to manipulate the phone, tab and every other internet-ready gadget.

However, security agents are warning that there are reasons to be concerned when your teenager or underage child gets hooked to the internet all the time.

They also warn that you should be concerned if you stumble on your child’s chats, and the conversation is written in coded language that you are unable to decode, however hard you try.

Police warn that some of the cryptic messages include drug references, while many are designed to arrange real life meetings with strangers.

We provide the meanings of some acronyms your child may be using to hoodwink you, yet expose him/herself to sexual exploitation, abduction, drug use, etc. They are the code words teenagers use to secretly exchange explicit messages and implicating photographs.
