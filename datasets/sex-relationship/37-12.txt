To protest his HIV+ status, artist creates world’s most painful sex toy
An artist who was shocked when he was diagnosed as being HIV-positive has created a dildo covered in pins and glass.

The artist, Paul Chisholm, said the work was his own way of damning the man who infected him with the virus during gay sex.

The sculpture has been dubbed the ‘world’s most painful sex toy,’ and it was named Viral Load.

Created in 2010, Viral Load is made of rubber and glass-headed pins, and it is expected sell for over $3,000 at a charity auction.

Thirty-three-year-old Paul discovered that he was HIV positive in 2007.

A member of the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transsexual, Paul narrates, “I went for an HIV test at the Mortimer Market Centre in central London, and when I went back a week later, they were all clear.

“I went off on holiday skiing in Switzerland with my then-boyfriend, and was really happy about the results.

“But half-way through the holiday, I got a call from the hospital asking me to go in because they had made a mistake with my results.

“I was in the middle of a mountain and found out I had HIV. It was quite shocking after being told I didn’t have it.

“I really didn’t know how to handle it, what to do or how to tell my boyfriend.”

Overwhelmed with shock, Paul made a call to the Terrence Higgins Trust, which he now says was a ‘lifeline.’

Paul said: “I felt like jumping off the mountain! I didn’t know where to turn or what to do; so I rang the Terrence Higgins Trust.

“The guy chatted to me for an hour-and-a-half and if it wasn’t for him explaining, telling me it was okay and giving me information about medication, I don’t know what I would have done.

“He really placated the shock, fear, and stigma, and allowed me to carry on – it was a lifeline.”

Three years later, Paul created Viral Load.

He said: “The work is like a voodoo doll in a way, stabbing the guy who I contracted the virus from.”
