Safest way to have sex on top of a table
When it comes to sex, experimentation is a word you can’t fault.

Sometimes, to overcome boredom in your sex life, you need to bring it out of the bedroom into a more exotic place, such as the bathroom, laundry room, even the garage!

However, if you love adventures, you may try sex from the height. And what better way to start than on a table!

Indeed, an unscientific poll found out that “table top” sex — where a woman sits on a table and her man stands in front of her — is a position women most want to try.

Sex therapist, Dr. Ian Kerner, assures that the position offers “easy clitoral stimulation.” But then, you need to know the practical steps involved in having sex on the table… Such as these ones…

• Height: The table should not be taller than your guy’s waist level, so your best bet is a kitchen table (30 inches is standard). If he’s a short man, try a desk (that is about 28 inches high). And let it stand against a wall—you’ll need the support when the push begins!

• Surface materials: Glass can be too slippery, so, avoid glass top tables. Also, avoid a cheap table you’ve assembled yourself, as it may give way at that decisive moment.

• Let it be strong: Again, a weak table may start making awkward creaking sounds that will announce what’s going on to the third party. You sure don’t want that! So, settle for a strong table.

• Legs: The legs of the table must be balanced, otherwise, the screws could loosen and collapse under your weight. This is not the climax you’re after. So, choose your table.
