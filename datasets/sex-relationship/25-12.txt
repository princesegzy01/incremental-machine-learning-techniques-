Sex makes you hate your job less, scientists say
No doubt, people love sex because it is pleasurable.

But experts are saying that pleasure isn’t the only reason you should keep getting busy underneath the sheets!

They say the mental and physical benefits of a healthy sex life extend far beyond your bedroom.

Researchers, scientists, and medical professionals who have studied exactly how sex improves nearly every facet of life say if you hate your job, having sex can be the necessary game changer that will make you fall in love with your job afresh.

According to the researchers, a great sex life makes you happier with your job and might even make you better at it!

This was the finding according to a recent study published in the Journal of Management.

Oregon State University researchers asked 159 married employees to complete two surveys every day for two weeks.

The participants noted how many times they had sex between the end of their work shift and the next morning.

Then, in the afternoon, they answered questions about how happy and engaged they felt at their jobs.

People who had sex the night before work were more likely to immerse themselves at their jobs and enjoy their time in the office the next day than those who didn’t make time for sex, the researchers found.

That might happen because sex produces a significant “morning positive effect,” the researchers say, meaning all of the good feelings associated with sex — mainly stemming from feel-good chemicals like oxytocin and dopamine — carried over and produced a nice mood boost the next day, too.
