Top 10 lies we tell our partners
Well, many of us take pride in saying we don’t lie. However, psychologists say you lie when you tell your partner the following:

• I am listening — when you are actually busy browsing a social media page.

• I’m not in a bad mood — when your body language and facial expression say otherwise.

• I only had one drink — even when your speech is slurred and you can hardly maintain your balance.

• I didn’t see your text/call — when you have only deleted your call log and emptied your message box just in case you want to prove him/her wrong.

• You don’t look fat — when s/he can hardly fit into his/her regular size again.

• I am sticking to my diet — after you have just walloped a plate of junk food.

• I did orgasm — when you know quite well that you faked it.

• This isn’t a new outfit — when you have not even finished the payment for that new outfit.

• Your bum doesn’t look big in that — even when the cloth is almost bursting in the middle because of the unwieldy backside.

• I wasn’t looking at her figure — even when you have just whistled in your mind, thinking, ‘Wow! What a knockout!’
