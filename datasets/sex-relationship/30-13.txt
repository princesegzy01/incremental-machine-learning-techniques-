Tell-tale signs your woman is into extra sex!
Well, rightly or wrongly, sex experts say the following are the signs to watch for if you’re suspecting that your woman is having sex with some other man!

• She rebuffs your advances. When a woman has just had sex with someone, she is likely to rebuff your sexual advances if you approach her for sex!

• She smells rather funny. Well, if she rushed out of the place where she had the extra sex without taking a shower, you may likely smell the ejaculate on her!

• She rushes to take her bath. If your woman dashes into the bathroom to clean up herself after an outing, there might be more to it!

• That ‘knowing smile’. A woman who has just had sex with another man would likely have this ‘knowing’ smile plastered her on her face, perhaps because she wants to cover up her guilt.

• Avoiding eye contacts. A cheating woman would find it difficult to maintain eye contact with you if she has been seeing another man.

• Crumpled attire. This is more of a teenage thing, but an adult woman may have her clothes crumpled if she had just had a quickie and hadn’t taken off her top before she did!

• Unprovoked angry outbursts. If you ask where she has been, she may accuse you of tele-guiding her or that you don’t trust her, blah, blah…

• Smudged make-up. If she had her make-up smudged all over, it may be an indication that someone had been there ahead of you!

• Fresh make-up, fresh perfume. In the alternative, a freshly-applied make-up and recently-sprayed perfume might be an indication that she has taken time to freshen up after a roll in the hay!

The bottom line: You may not necessarily take this as gospel truth, because you may not be right, after all.
