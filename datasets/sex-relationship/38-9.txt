10 things to say to get her naked … right now!
“I love you”? Ugh! If men knew how many times a woman gets to hear that in a day, they would look for better ways of convincing her to … er … well … open up!

How to go about it? Relationship experts suggest these tried-and-tested lines…

• “You look so hot right now.”

This assertion hardly fails, because you can use it in just about any situation — whether she’s wearing a ball gown or a bikini, says relationship expert, Dr. Carole Lieberman. Truth is, any woman would feel desirable when complimented this way; and, as long as you’re being sincere, you are good to go!

• “I’d love to see you again.”

Use this one with a girl you’ve just met. This line is the less-creepy version of trying to hustle her out the door with a “Let’s go somewhere … quieter.” It shows her that you won’t push her and that you have an interest in seeing her again, says sex expert, Dr. Nicole Prause.

• “Everything about you turns me on.”

Tell her she turns you on and then go on to compliment her attributes such as her hair, eyes, or curves, says Astroglide sexpert, Dr. Yvonne Fulbright. No matter what her body type, a woman likes to feel like a woman, and wants her guy to think she encompasses everything positive about that, Fulbright says. Any woman would feel good to know that you notice her and that you find her so lovely.

• “You’re so hard to resist.”

Instead of trying to rush her, let her know that you’re not really the kind of guy that pushes women around, but you just can’t help yourself with her. “This makes her feel like she’s better than all the other women you’ve dated,” says Lieberman.

• “I’ve got a suite for the weekend … I’d love to spend it with you.”

Investing a little can get you a lot, says sex expert, April Masini. “Women love luxury hotels, and hotel sex is the best there could be for just about everyone,” she says. “Make her feel like she’s the cherished guest, and you’ll score a lot more easily.”

• “I’ll do the dishes.”

Getting naked is a sign of vulnerability and trust, according to Clark. So, for her to want to be naked, she must feel safe. While there are plenty of ways to make her feel safe, an easy way is to take care of the things she needs doing, such as chores and errands, especially if she’s been feeling stressed out.

• “I’m not just after sex.”

This works because it’s exactly the question she’s wrestling with, Lieberman says. ‘Is he just after sex, or does he really like me?’ But remember, don’t make promises you can’t keep, because you’ll have to answer to them once the sex is over.

• “You’re the sexiest woman in the world to me.”

It’s like the first line, but it plays more into her sensuality and her seductiveness. Note how you’re not saying she’s the sexiest woman in the world, but the sexiest woman in the world…to you…right now. It’s simple, and highlights your arousal without being too disrespectful, blunt, or forward, says Fulbright.

• “Let me walk you to your car.”

“Both men and women have fears about sex, but women especially are at a greater risk for getting infections and being assaulted,” says Prause. “Any communication you provide that shows a genuine concern for her safety should promote intimacy.” Walking her to her car —or to her door — is a low-risk, chivalrous way to show her that you’re the kind of guy who will look out for her both in and out of the bedroom.

• “Let’s wait … I want it to be really special.”

Ironically, saying something like this is enough to make her feel extraordinary and want to jump into bed sooner, says Lieberman. Just make sure that you don’t push it at all if she agrees and wants to wait, because you’ll look like a liar.

Last line: Well, if she looks you straight in the face and calls you a liar, please don’t blame us. You probably are!
