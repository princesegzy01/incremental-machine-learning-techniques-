Egypt conducts anal exams on suspected gay men
Authorities in Egypt recently carried out anal examinations on men suspected to be gay in order to determine whether they have had anal sex.

In the last few weeks, Egyptian policemen have arrested about 22 people as part of a crackdown on gays after a rainbow flag was raised at an indie concert, say human rights activists.

While at least 33 people have been arrested since September 23, a day after a group of activists was seen raising the pro-LGBT flag.

Amnesty International confirmed that at least five of those arrested were subjected to anal examinations to determine whether they were engaged in same-sex sexual relations – a practice it said amounted to torture and was scientifically unsound.

“Whether they were waving a rainbow flag, chatting on a dating app, or minding their own business in the streets, all these debauchery arrest victims should be immediately released,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, the Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch.

“The Egyptian government, by rounding people up based on their presumed sexual orientation, is showing flagrant disregard for their rights.”

According to Middle Eastern Eye, homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in Egypt, but it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife. Gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery, immorality or blasphemy.

The largest crackdown on homosexuals took place in 2001 when police raided a floating disco called the Queen Boat. Fifty-two men were tried in the case.
