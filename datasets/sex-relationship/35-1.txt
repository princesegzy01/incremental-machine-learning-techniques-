Six best cars to have sex in
There’s an adage that says, ‘Anything worth doing at all is worth doing well.’ And that is the truth about having sex in a car!

There are cars and there are cars. Can you ever imagine attempting to have sex in a Volkswagen Beetle, Tico or such other cars with acute space constraint?

When you are on the road with your partner and you suddenly develop a better idea of getting private without paying an extra dime for hotel room, here are the best cars to engage your fantasy in…

• Bentley Mulsanne: The best place for comfortable road sex is in the back seat of a Bentley Mulsanne.

It has one of the nicest interiors in the automotive realm, and provides a ride smoother than freshly-churned butter. Again, it has a massive back seat that offers a champagne cooler and a pair of crystal flutes to drink from. Obviosuly, there’s no classier place to make babies at highway velocity than the rear of this massive luxury sedan.

• Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet: The Mercedes-Maybach G 650 Landaulet is an SUV from Mercedes super-luxury brand.

It’s a dream car that keeps its occupants seated in the lap of luxury. Its combination of first class-specifications rear seats, which provides ultimate massaging when it reclines almost flat, makes it perfect for that unforgettable sex. It also has a convertible top over the back to reveal the stars in all their glory, sending you to the dreamland effortlessly.

• Ferrari GTC4Lusso: Though Ferraris are sexy, their low roofs and compact interior can make you decide not to push your luck with sex inside of one.

But the GTC4Lusso brand, with room for four and other perks make this Ferrari brand exquisitely suitable for that quickie. Wow!

• Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo: The new Panamera Sport Turismo Porsche, being a wagon, has a standard rear bench seat that allows you to indulge yourself sexually. Go for it!

• Chrysler Pacifica: The Pacifica may not be sexy by most traditional metrics, but it has features big and small that make sex a lot more convenient than you can imagine.

Both second and third rows of seats stow into the floor, creating a massive open surface to spread out. And if things get messy, the Pacifica has a built-in vacuum cleaner that will do the cleaning in a jiffy.

• Honda Ridgeline: Since the tailgate swings both ways, it makes entry and exit easy and can serve as a bed trunk. And with an in-built system that transforms the bed walls into speakers, you have a perfect combo for blasting good music to pep up the mood.

Warnings: Find a private place to park, and don’t forget to switch off the engine!
