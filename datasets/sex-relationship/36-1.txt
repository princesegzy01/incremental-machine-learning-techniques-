Seven things that happen to your body during sex
Sex is one experience that never leaves you the same any time you indulge in it.

The racing heart, the urge to nap immediately, the calmness… Experts say the feelings that trail sexual desires and the actual act of sex itself to the point of orgasm and beyond are full of physiological reactions from head to toes

Clinical associate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology, Dr. Lauren Streicher, notes that there are so many organs and systems involved in sexual function, and an individual needs every single one to be in working order for sex to go well, because sex is not just all about hormones.

To be sure, therefore, here’s how sex affects your body, head to toes!

• Brain chemicals and hormones get busy: Streicher say that libido starts in the brain—what we might call ‘being in the mood.’ Loosely speaking, this is a balance of the sex hormones that facilitates the desires. For women, the excitement phase is above the shoulders, while it is below the waist for men, says obstetrician, Dr. Sherry Ross. That is why racing thoughts, depression, stress, or even just thinking about your to-do list can kill the mood in a jiffy. During and after sex, endorphin surges, leading to feelings of euphoria and deep relaxation, which leads to feelings of lovingness, lower blood pressure, and less stress.

• Your heart flutters: You’re excited, you’re physically active, and you need blood to get to the areas of main attraction, so your heartbeat picks up to pump blood around the body, with a specific focus on the genitals. Your breathing rate will increase too, to help your heart maintain this quickened pace, Ross says. This way, sex is almost like a workout, but with much more fun.

• Blood vessels dilate: As your heart rate picks up, your blood vessels dilate or expand, which allows more blood to flow to sex organs and other erogenous zones. “More blood flow to the genitals is why a guy gets an erection and a woman starts to lubricate,” Streicher explains.

• Skin flushes: Dilated blood vessels also mean more blood gets to the skin, too. That’s what’s behind any flushing, blushing, or warmth to the skin

• Muscles contract: Especially muscles in the pelvic floor, abdomen and the legs. They all contract in preparation for climax. This makes the body to tense up before the relaxation of an orgasm, Ross says.

• The vagina lubricates: Blood flow to the genitals stimulates and lubricates the vagina, while it also leads to the swelling of the labia and clitoris in women.

• Breasts swell: Again, blood flow to the breasts can actually make them temporarily larger and more sensitive. Nipples may also become erect.
