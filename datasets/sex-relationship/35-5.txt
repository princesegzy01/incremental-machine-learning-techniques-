Man gets metal ring stuck on penis, rescued by firefighters
A man got his manhood trapped in a penis ring for two days after he could not pull it off.

It became an emergency case and he was rushed to the Mater University Hospital in Dublin, Ireland.

But doctors could not remove the device with orthopaedic instruments and they had to call firefighters to the emergency room where he was being attended to.

The physicians said their patient had developed “penile strangulation,” a rare condition that requires urgent treatment if he must not lose total use of his manhood.

They also applied ice packs to the man’s genitals in a bid to reduce the swelling, according to the Irish Medical Journal.

At the end of the day, hydraulic tools usually used by firefighters for removing people from car wrecks were employed to cut up the ring.

The ring is a sex toy worn around the base of the penis, with the sole purpose of improving erections.

One of the firefighters told the Evening Standard that the patient had worn a ring on his manhood, but the ring stopped blood circulation to the organ and became stuck.

The unnamed man had reportedly tried for two days to remove the ring, but he later realised that he was in trouble, as his penis became swollen and assumed a funny colour.

Removing the devices can be “challenging”, depending on the size of the ring and the type of metal it is made from, the journal reports.

In severe cases of “penile strangulation”, the patient may suffer gangrene, necrosis, or the complete amputation of his manhood.
