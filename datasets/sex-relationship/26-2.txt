Young men risk broken willy through dangerous sex position
Men are at greatest risk of suffering a broken penis when having sex doggy style, experts warn.

They add that young men are more susceptible to injuries.

The most risky sex positions were drawn up by Brazilian researchers after quizzing 90 victims.

Their study was published in the International Journal of Impotence Research.

The injury through doggy style of sex comes just ahead of the missionary position.

Though seen as a fun way to have sex, doggy style has been named the most risky sex position for men.

The third most likely cause of broken penis is “overzealous masturbation,” followed by the cowgirl, where the woman sits atop her man’s penis, sexologists have warned.

Penis fracture happens when tubes keeping up an erection bend with an agonising pop after being accidentally thrust against a hard object such as a partner’s pubic bone, doctors say.

The risk is highest during “vigorous sexual intercourse,” doctors note.

Men in their 20s and 30s are most likely to suffer due to better fitness and firmer erections.

In one case, US doctors in Seattle treated a patient who had tried to penetrate his wife with a flying leap.
