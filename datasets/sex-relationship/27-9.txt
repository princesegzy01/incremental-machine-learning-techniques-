Types of men who are most likely to cheat
Being cheated on is never fun, it’s a fact of life. Fortunately, because it’s been happening since the dawn of humanity, we’re getting pretty good at identifying cheaters.

Here’s a roundup of research that has looked into which types of men are the most likely to cheat on their partners.

Tall men

A 2014 study by Illicit Encounters found that taller men are more likely to cheat. Men who are over 5ft 10, in fact, were found to be twice as likely to cheat than someone under that height. Why? Apparently because they have more confidence, stemming from the fact they know a lot of women prefer taller men.

Men aged 29, 39, 49 and so on…

A study in 2015 by Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences found that people “search for meaning” when they’re approaching a new decade of their lives. This, apparently, includes having an affair.

Men who play team sports

Recent research suggests men who play team sports are most likely to use that as a cover-up when they’re cheating. Rugby players were found to be the worst culprits.

Men who work in finance

Bankers and brokers are most likely to be unfaithful, according to a poll by dating website Victoria Milan of more than 5,000 women. The women were all cheating on their partner, so the research was based on women only – but still, it’s something to bear in mind.

Men with facial hair

A survey by the Eva video social network surveyed men and found that those with facial hair are more likely to cheat (as well as steal).

Tattooed men

Men with tattoos are more likely to be unfaithful, according to another study by Victoria Milan. They asked more than three million men across 15 countries, and found that those with more ink are more likely to stray.
