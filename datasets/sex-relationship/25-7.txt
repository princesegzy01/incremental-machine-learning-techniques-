VIDEO: Popular Nigerian biker proposes to girlfriend by Abeokuta flyover
It was the weekend that Bikers Converge held this year’s edition of its annual gathering.

Those who know so much about the event say Bikers Converge is an annual gathering of top bikers and lovers of sophisticated machines in Ogun State.

The occasion, they say, provides an avenue for bike sports to be spiced with fashion and entertainment.

According to Instagram user, Oba Michael, quoting Mr. Adeola Ogundimu who he described as “one of the major pioneers” of the convergence, “over 400 bikers turned up for this year’s event.”

However, as the bikers did their thing, one of them, Dr. Olukwu Faraday of Gym House, Ibadan, had something more interesting for his girlfriend, Miss Joy Ororuwa, who is also a member of the prestigious riders.

Faraday used the ambiance of the occasion to propose to Joy right by the flyover at Iyana-Mortuary, Abeokuta, as other members of the group cheered them on!
