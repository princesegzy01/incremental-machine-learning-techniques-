To stay alive, don’t have another baby, doctors warn Kim Kardashian
After Kim Kardashian suffered complications with her previous pregnancies and deliveries, doctors have told her that having another kid could lead to health complications.

Against her doctor’s warning, though, Kim decided to undergo a surgery that would prepare her uterus for pregnancy, which worried her family, especially her mum.

Eventually, her mum, Kris, told her that she was proud of her for wanting to give her kids a big family and huge support system but also that she was worried about her putting herself in danger.

Following her painful procedure, the doctor announced there were complications with her bladder during the surgery.

According to Kim, she had to have a catheter, which was obviously not any fun at all, and it became even worse when, ultimately, it didn’t give her the result that she wanted.

The surgery allowed her doctor to advise Kim not to ever carry a child again, and the mother-of-two seemed completely heartbroken by the news.

Last November, Kim had revealed on the family’s reality show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, that she was considering using a surrogate mother for her attempt at baby number three with husband Kanye West.
