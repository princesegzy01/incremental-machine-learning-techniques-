Eight new ways to make your man scream during sex
While it’s true that women have some very specific pleasure points on their body, many people might be surprised to know that men also have trigger spots that, when stimulated, will send him over the edge.

Check out these following spots and see how stimulating them sets your man to the moon…

The frenulum

• This is the underside of the penis just below the head

• The concentration of nerve endings here is sometimes compared to the female equivalent of the clitoris.

• Stroke this with your hands or thumb while you move your fingers around the shaft.

• To slowly build his arousal, go back and forth between stimulating his frenulum and the less sensitive base of his penis.

Soles of his feet

• There is an acupressure point about one-third of the way down from the third toe, right in front of the arch in the centre of the foot.

• Pressing on this point may boost blood flow throughout the body, getting him all hot and aroused.

• Start your foreplay by giving him a foot massage.

• Have a warm towel ready and then place his feet on a pillow on your lap.

• Use the warm towel to wipe his feet and get them warm

• Then focus on this point by taking your thumb and gently rubbing it around this spot as a transition to a more erotic kind of rubdown.

The prostate

• The prostate is internally located between the base of a man’s penis and his anus.

• Touching him on the outside of that area can externally stimulate the gland.

• Have him lie on his back with his knees bent and legs spread apart.

• Use your fist to apply even pressure to the area with quick vibration-like motions.

Thumb

• The thumb is aa sexy spot for a lot of guys.

• To suck on a man’s thumb evokes sucking on something else, and can help him connect his mind and body during lovemaking.

• Start off foreplay by gazing into his eyes as you kiss his hands, and then suck on his thumb as a promise for what’s to come.

Gluteal fold

• The crease where the top of his thigh meets his butt is a sure-fire passion point.

• Use your hand to stroke him, run your fingernails over the area, then build up to a gentle slap.

• Or, when he is lying on his stomach, try kissing a trail down his back, over his buttocks, and then gently nibble along this fold and flick it with your tongue before moving on to his inner thighs.

Sacrum

• The sacrum is the triangular bone located at the base of his spine in-between his hips (the small of his back).

• There are nerves in the sacrum that are linked to the genitals, so stimulating these nerves can send sensations to his penis and can trigger orgasm.

Nipples

• Start by stroking around the aureole and gently tweak the nipple with your fingers.

• Lick around it and suck on it, increasing pressure and gently biting it.

Scrotal raphe

• It’s easy to give his penis all the loving, but don’t leave his balls out.

• The scrotal sack is the loose skin that surrounds the testicles and that’s what feels good to stimulate.

• The line that runs in the middle like a seam is the raphe.

• Gently flick the raphe with your tongue.

• Let him guide you on how much pressure he likes because the amount varies depending on the guy.
