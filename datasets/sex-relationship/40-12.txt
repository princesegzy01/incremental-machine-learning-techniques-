Boyfriends, husbands are not financial partners, Reno Omokri says
Controversial social media user, Reno Omokri, has taken a swipe at women who expect their boyfriends to support them financially.

According to him, any woman who needs money should rather start a business that would take care of her needs, instead of relying on a lover.

Omokri, who was special adviser on social media to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, had tweeted, “Start a business if you want a financial partner instead of getting a boyfriend. A boyfriend aren’t (sic) poverty alleviation scheme #RenosNuggets.

He is also of the view that a husband is the head of the home, but even at that, the wife may not be financially dependent on him.

As far as Omokri is concerned, a woman must earn any money she needs, independent of the husband — or boyfriend, as applicable.

Here are the tweets:

A husband is regarded as the head, not a boyfriend. If you need ‘support’ go and get a job, not a boyfriend! pic.twitter.com/1XFqRtKKpb — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) April 3, 2017
