Two women land in hospital with broken bones after a threesome went wrong
Two women are in hospital with broken bones after a threesome with a man went wrong.

The first woman suffered broken bones in her feet and legs after she toppled 10 feet from a balcony as she reached orgasm.

Her naked friend screamed and ran down the stairs to help her, slipped, and broke bones in her own arm and neck.

Medics arrived at the apartment where the embarrassed man explained what had occurred.

Police said the female victims of the sex-game-gone-wrong were both naked.

The man in the threesome told policemen that, “During the lovemaking, there was a positional quarrel, with one of the ladies leaning against a balcony railing, which led to her plunge.”

Police added that it was an accident and that no charges will be pressed.

“The names and ages of the victims will not be released, to spare them from embarrassment,” police said.

The incident happened in the little town of Bad Breisig, Germany.
