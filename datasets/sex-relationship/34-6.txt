Facebook user advises single ladies
In a post entitled, ‘To the ladies … still unattached,’ a Facebook user, Emmanuel Majebi, has advised single ladies on the type of men to marry, based on character disposition and other considerations.

Using the different football clubs and their foibles and virtues, Majebi had written:

• If you want a very patient man, date an Arsenal fan.

• If you want a man that boasts of his grandfather’s achievements, date a Liverpool fan.

• If you want a man that will spend much money on you and later discards you, date a Chelsea fan.

• If you want a man that will do anything in life to make you achieve your goals, date a Manchester United fan

• If you want a man who has everything in life but still wants more, date a Barcelona fan.

• If you want a man whose goal in life is just to better the lot of his nneighbours, date a Spurs fan!!!
