Man breaks penis during vigorous sex
One man’s night went from great to a living nightmare after he broke his penis while having sex with his wife.

Experts say a man can actually break his penis during ‘vigorous intercourse.’

Sexologists say while new sex positions can be fun and exciting, you should not push the limit too much, as it could end in penis snapping.

According to reports, the man and his wife were having sex when he heard a cracking sound, followed by his penis immediately swelling up and developing dark bruising, making it resemble an eggplant.

When the man arrived at the hospital, his penis was badly swollen, discoloured, and protruding at an odd angle.

The doctors diagnosed the man with a penile fracture.

Experts warn that a penile fracture is actually a tear of the corpora cavernosa, an erectile tissue that runs along the penis.

Corpora cavernosa becomes hard when blood flows through it during an erection.

Luckily, the doctors were able to repair the man’s penis.

The Daily Mail stated that without immediate treatment, a broken penis can lead to erectile dysfunction and other complications.

Experts say that as long as you see a doctor quickly, you should be able to have sex again in four to six weeks.
