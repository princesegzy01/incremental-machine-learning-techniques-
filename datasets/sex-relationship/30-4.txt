Wife slaps husband for ogling girl, told to offer cow to appease him
A woman who slapped her husband, allegedly for pinching a girl’s buttocks, has been told to apologise to him with a cow.

The Instagram user, who would not be named, said she and her husband had gone to a restaurant to eat; but the man seemed taken in by the backside of the lady serving them, and couldn’t resist feeling her butts.

As the wife narrated, she was enraged at her husband’s audacity and went ahead to slap him.

He returned the slap, and the two of them fought dirty right there.

Her husband reported her to his family, who have now mandated her to appease her husband with a live cow.
