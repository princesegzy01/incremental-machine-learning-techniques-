Words to avoid on your online dating profile
In this age of inter-connectivity and global village-hood, dating across the Atlantic using the cyberspace has only got trendier.

However, experts on online dating are warning that if you’ve been finding it difficult to nab that dream date, it might be due to the way you frame your online profile.

They say that apart from unflattering selfies and “unfortunate poses” that might likely put people off, words can also have a huge impact when it comes to bagging a date.

The following are the words you should never use on your online dating profile if you want to nab a hot date, according to experts.

So, which words are best for those looking for a hook-up?

For women

• Avoid describing yourself as ‘shy’, ‘trustworthy’ or ‘happy’ if you want to get a date.

• Instead, describe yourself as: sexy, honest, confident.

• Men also respond well to the word “curvy” – though women were found to rarely use it on their profiles.

For men

• Avoid sounding vain on your online dating profile

• Don’t describe yourself as “handsome” on your profile – as women value character over vanity.

• Winning words for men were found to be: Honest, intelligent, confident, humorous.

And note: Men who use explicit language on dating apps are more likely to be sex predators, experts warn.
