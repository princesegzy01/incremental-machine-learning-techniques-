10 things to say to get her naked this weekend!
Many men have yet to master the alpha-male tricks that make ladies want to take it all off!

As the weekend is here live, you must know the right cords to strike if you must get her to undress right away!

“For any line to work, she has to be predisposed, in some way, to getting naked with you,” says clinical psychiatrist Alicia Clark.

“A true line only works if she already wants to take her clothes off. At best, a line can establish rapport and show confidence.”

So, if you’re ready to make this weekend memorable, here are 10 lines that will get her to take it off — in the right situation.

• Everything about you turns me on. Tell her she turns you on and then lead with an unexpected attribute — like her hair, eyes, or curves — so it doesn’t sound too cheesy, says sex expert, Dr. Yvonne Fulbright. No matter what her body type, a woman likes to feel like a woman, and wants her guy to think she encompasses everything positive about that, Fulbright says. There’s a certain vulnerability in letting her know that you notice her and that you find her so lovely.

• You look so hot right now. This should be your go-to line, because you can use it in just about any situation — whether she’s wearing a ball gown or a bikini, says relationship expert, Carole Lieberman. This makes her feel desirable, and, as long as you’re being sincere, will be regarded as the ultimate compliment.

• You’re so hard to resist. Rush in too quickly, and she’ll feel like you do this all the time. Instead, let her know that you’re not really that kind of guy, but you just can’t help yourself with her. This makes her feel like she’s better than all the other women you’ve dated, says Lieberman.

• I’m not just after sex. This works because it’s exactly the question she’s wrestling with. ‘Is he just after sex, or does he really like me?’ is the nagging question in her mind. But remember — don’t make promises you can’t keep.

• Let’s wait … I want it to be really special. Ironically, saying something like this is enough to make her feel extraordinary and want to jump into bed sooner, says Lieberman. Just make sure that you don’t push it at all if she agrees and wants to wait, because you’ll look like a liar.

• I’d love to see you again when I don’t have to yell! Use this one with a girl you’ve just met in a loud environment, such as a bar or a club. This line is better than trying to hustle her out the door with a ‘Let’s go somewhere quieter.’ It shows her that you won’t push her and that you have an interest in seeing her again, says sex expert, Dr. Nicole Prause.

• I’ve got a suite for the weekend and I’d love to share it with you. Investing a little can get you a lot, says sex expert April Masini. Women love luxury hotels, and hotel sex is hot for just about everyone, she says. Make her feel like she’s the cherished guest, and you’ll score a lot more easily.

• I’ll do the dishes. Getting naked is a sign of vulnerability and trust, according to Clark. So, in order for her to want to be naked, she has to feel safe. While there are plenty of ways to make her feel safe, an easy way is to take care of the things she needs doing, such as chores and errands, especially if she’s been feeling stressed out.

• You’re the sexiest woman in the world to me. This plays more into her sensuality and her seductiveness. “It’s simple and sincere, and highlights your arousal without being too disrespectful, blunt, or forward,” says Fulbright.

• Let me walk you to your car. Both men and women have fears about sex, but women especially are at a greater risk for getting infections and being assaulted, experts say. Any communication you provide that shows a genuine concern for her safety should promote intimacy. Walking her to her car — or to her door — is a low-risk, chivalrous way to show her that you’re the kind of guy who will look out for her both in and out of the bedroom.
