Five embarrassing side effects of sex women worry about
Well, we all know that sex affects men and women differently. However, what many don’t know is that there are other embarrassing side effects of sex that even women who are experienced in the game can’t wrap their heads around.

What are these embarrassing side effects of sex? These ones….

• Pain during sex: New research published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that three out of 10 women experience pain during vaginal sex, and most them experience this discomfort inside their vagina or around the vaginal entrance. The pain could be caused by several things, from not being wet enough, to having vigorous, thrusting sex, says Herbenick, a co-author of the study.

• Farting through the vagina: It’s not uncommon for the vagina to let out a noise that sounds shockingly like a fart during sex as the man thrusts in and out. The ‘noise’ is the result of a trapped pocket of air getting pushed out of your vagina, and the sound that follows often resembles having gas, explains associate professor at Indiana University, Dr. Debby Herbenick. “This is completely normal and something that happens to many women,” Herbenick assures. Switching to gentler sex or a position where the penis doesn’t come entirely out of the vagina with each thrust can help, Herbenick says.

• Vagina wetness: Whether you’re squirting or experiencing female ejaculation, both are natural side effects of having sex and shouldn’t be a source of anxiety. So how do you know which is which? Research shows that female ejaculate — which is different than the lubrication produced when you’re turned on — is a small amount of whitish fluid that occurs just before you climax.

• Crash-out after sex: If you can’t seem to muster the energy for round two, don’t worry; you are absolutely normal. As the content and brand manager at the Centre for Sexual Pleasure and Health, Erin Basler-Francis, says, during sexual arousal, the body becomes its own chemistry lab; but it’s not until after you finish that your brain releases vasopressin and prolactin — the chemicals that promote stress relief, relaxation, and ultimately, sleep.

• Urinary Tract Infection: UTIs after sex are extremely common in women. It’s believed that the friction of vaginal intercourse makes it easier for bacteria to enter the bladder via the urethra. Additionally, the opening to the urethra is close to the vagina and anus, which makes it easier for bacteria from those areas to get into the urinary tract. A woman’s risk of bladder infection with sex also rises with more frequent sex, pregnancy, use of diaphragms, as well as the use of spermicides with or without condoms.
