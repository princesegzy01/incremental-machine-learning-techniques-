Seven out of 10 married women think their husbands are stingy, study reveals
Ask any married woman, and you won’t be surprised to hear that they think their husbands could do better when it comes to releasing money for family spending.

According to extra-marital affairs website, Gleeden, 74% of married women think that their partners are too stingy.

The women say a lack of presents, flowers, holidays and smart restaurants is apparently the root cause of this perception.

Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed went on to say that their partner’s stinginess was a contributing factor to their infidelity.

The survey, which quizzed over 5,000 women, found that 56 per cent of women who saw their other half as stingy had had an argument about it, all of which seems to prompt the question, ‘Why don’t you buy yourself some flowers with your own money?’

But, according to the women who took part in the survey, it’s not actually about the flowers or the present, it’s about the meaning behind it, and the feeling of being loved.

Thirty-nine per cent of women said that they resented the lack of generosity because they want to feel valued.

Twenty-nine per cent said that they saw the lack of generosity as a sign that their partner wasn’t making an effort and no-longer really cared about them.

Only 26 percent of the women who took the survey said that the stinginess was a problem within itself, saying that the lack of presents was a passion killer.
