Five things women want in bed
Knowing what a woman wants in bed is the first step towards achieving optimal sexual pleasure, both for a man and his woman.

To know how to please your woman in bed, therefore, here’s what to know, as sex experts tell us!

• Be aware of how clitoris functions: Women can find it difficult to climax from intercourse alone, says sex counsellor, Dr. Ian Kerner. He suggests trying a slow grinding, with her on top. That way, she controls the movement whichever way she deprives pleasure from it.

• Don’t rush through foreplay: Women want more foreplay — be it oral stimulation of any part of the body, touching, sucking, etc. Women need foreplay for the arousal that leads to desire, says Kerner. His female clients also complain about a limited sex menu, so foreplay’s variety (all that kissing, rubbing, talking, stroking) can work wonders. Even watching a hot show together can help.

• Smell fresh: Humans can get very aroused without any physical touch, Kerner says. Have a shower and be ready before you dim the bedroom lights. Tell her she’s hotter than the actress in the show, and let your hands explore each other’s laps. Start kissing…

• Don’t be afraid to make demands: Just ask. That’s all you need to do to convince her to experiment in bed. So, ask.

• Relax, already: Feeling pressure to perform? Can’t blame you: Women are beginning to demand good sex, sex experts say. They’re not just lying back and thinking of whatever. Today’s career women can be pickier, Kerner says. Plus, men have a natural desire to want to please women in bed. So, try to relax a little. Distract yourself by focusing on intimate details — her sounds, her expressions, her erect nipples. Encourage her to tell you what to do, says a sexuality expert, Dr. Pepper Schwartz. Tell her you like it when she tells you what she wants.

The bottom line: Satisfy her and she’ll invite you back.
