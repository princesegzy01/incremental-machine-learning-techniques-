When it comes to sex partners, how many is too many?
Men and women both consider 12 to be the ‘ideal’ number of sexual partners. They said it suggests someone who is ‘sexually adventurous’ and ‘liberal.’ Fewer than 10 is ‘too conservative’ while more than 19 would be a red flag.

A new survey has revealed what both men and women think is the ‘ideal’ number of sexual partners, however.

The study by IllicitEncounters.com, a dating website for married people, found both sexes agreed that 12 was the perfect number of lovers to have had.

Asked why a dozen partners was perfect, both sexes said it showed someone was “sexually adventurous, liberal and transient.”

Meanwhile someone who has had fewer than 10 partners is regarded as being “too conservative” and “sexually inexperienced,” according to the research.

On the other hand, both men and women agreed that anything above 19 partners is a red flag, as they would consider the person to be “too selfish,” “difficult to please” or “too eager to jump from partner to partner.”

However there was disagreement between the sexes over how important it is to know the number of people a partner has had sex with.

Just 45 per cent of women said they would want to know how many people their partner had slept with, while 53 per cent of men would want to ask the question.

Explaining the findings, Christian Grant, spokesman for IllicitEncounters.com, said: “Men are a little more self-conscious when it comes to competition.

“They want to be seen as the biggest and best; whether that stems from genuinely wanting to satisfy their partner or to massage their own ego is another matter entirely.

“Women on the other hand are just happy to enjoy the moment, past experiences aside.”
