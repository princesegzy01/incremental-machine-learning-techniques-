10 top sex tips for women
• Make the first move. Men love it when women make the first move. So, initiate sex and take control. Take your time and set your own sexual pace to increase your own pleasure.

• Dress to impress. Experiment with dressing up to boost your sexual arousal. If a man in uniform turns you on, get your partner to dress up. Why not meet your lover at the door dressed in a tight skirt and blouse with stockings and killer heels to get his attention?

• Use toys. Regular sex toy use has been shown to increase sexual experience and satisfaction, rather than be a threat to a relationship and can lead to more satisfying orgasms. Many men love to watch their partner use a sex toy on themselves.

• Love lubricants. Using lubricant during sex can greatly increase both your sexual pleasure and that of your man and make sex last longer too.

• Stop worrying about your body. Men are attracted to the whole package; so, become more confident with your body. Loving the way you look will make you irresistible to your partner.

• Change position. Being on top is extremely pleasurable for many women and will excite your partner too. Using a vibrating cock ring will stimulate both of you; or try a small bullet vibrator against your clitoris to achieve a mind-blowing orgasm.

• Change it up. Make sex more fun by having it in other places, either inside or outside. Have a steamy shower, soaping each other with perfumed soaps or oils. Try having sex in the morning to keep you smiling all day or arrange to meet for lunch to have one.

• Read erotic fiction. Reading a few chapters from a short steamy erotic story will coax the first sparks of sexual desire in you and give you some ideas for your own sex life too.

• Tie me up. Blindfolding your man or being tied up and blindfolded yourself, using only your sense of smell, touch, taste and hearing can be intensely sexually arousing.

• Talk to each other. Open up a conversation about what makes you tick and what turns you on sexually. You may be pleasantly surprised about what your partner fantasises about.
