Married man, 69, dies of heart attack while masturbating
A 69-year-old married man who was simply identified as Bill and said to be based in Eastern Pennsylvania has reportedly died of heart attack in the course of a masturbation spree, which he streamed live.

In the nearly 10 minutes of a video that went viral, his wife found him lying unconscious and called in the paramedics.

All efforts to revive him proved abortive, though.
