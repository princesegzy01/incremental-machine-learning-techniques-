Man kills wife after he failed to satisfy her sexually
A man from Gwanda area of Zimbabwe known as Ndabayezulu Ncube has killed his wife Nokuthula Khumalo who stopped having sex with him after failing to satisfy her in bed.

According to the report, the man became frustrated because his wife stopped having sex with him and struck her twice with a hoe on the face resulting in her instant death.

Information gathered revealed that the couple had an argument because Ncube was allegedly a flop in bed yet he never stopped demanding sex.

A neighbour who begged anonymity told Iharare.com, “The couple had arguments and fights in the past days because Ncube’s wife was always complaining that he could not satisfy her in bed, so maybe she thought it was wise for her not to sleep with him totally.”

A police spokesperson in the area, Philisani Ndebele confirmed the incident.

“On June 19, a man called Ndabayezulu attacked and struck his wife two times with a hoe on her face leading to her death after she deprived the killer of conjugal rights. He has been remanded in prison till he will appear in court for trial.”
