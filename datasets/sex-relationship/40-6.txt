The first thing guys notice about ladies
• Your mouth. A lady’s mouth is often the very first part of a woman a guy will see. Not only are great lips and teeth sexy, but guys will look to your mouth for social cues, as it’s the most expressive feature you possess. A warm, inviting smile might communicate, ‘Here I am, come talk to me.’ A sly, seductive smirk might convey, ‘You can try, but you’ll have to work for it.’ And a scowl may suggest, ‘Turn around, and head back to your mother’s basement.’

• Your Laugh. A lovely lady’s laugh is one of the most beautiful sounds a single guy can hear, as he’ll be psyched to know that his charms are working. The laugh itself will help him decide if he’d like to ask the girl out.

• Your boobs. Look, unless they’re concealed and shrouded, your breasts will be noticed by any warm-blooded male who meets you for the first time. Men are simply biologically programmed to seek them out!

• Your butt. When you leave, he will likely grab a glimpse of your buttocks. Most gentlemen either fall more squarely in the ‘breast’ or ‘butt’ camp.

• Your confidence. Most important of all to a guy meeting you for the first time is the energy that you exude. There is absolutely nothing that a guy finds more attractive than confidence.

• Your personal style. Men believe they are quite capable of observing and interpreting a woman’s personal style. The typical guy will inevitably categorise your style in the first instant he meets you and it will definitely impact his first impression.

• Your voice. While it may not be the first feature of yours he talks about with his pals, a guy will certainly be aware of the sound of your voice, especially if that voice is exceptionally sexy, or unusually obnoxious. Your voice can instantly change a person’s perception about you, for better or for worse.

• Your friends. You spend enough time with some of your friends that you likely share many traits and qualities. Guys know this and will probably judge you by the company you keep.

• Your body type. It’s not something anyone likes to admit, but your build is as much a part of you as any other physical characteristics. For plenty of guys, a woman’s weight is a more superficial attribute that matters less to them than other factors when choosing a mate.

• Your smell. Your scent is often the one thing about you that a guy will remember most vividly long after you’ve parted ways. It can linger on clothes, hands, or linens, and give the guy a gentle reminder of the amazing woman he’s just met.

• Your six-inch heels. Guys do tend to notice shoes when they’re overtly uncomfortable-looking or if you look uncomfortable in them.

• Your eyes. Though a less tactful guy might get caught sneaking a peek at other assets, your eyes are what a guy should be looking at during conversation. But any experienced guy will want to look into your eyes for more than just their lovely aesthetic properties. A lot of information can be conveyed and received via eye contact, and any guy trying to get to know you will look to yours as a means of flirting and reading signals.

• Your sense of humour. As much as any guy would love to make you laugh, your ability to do the same for him is a huge turn-on that he’ll notice right away.
