Eight uncommon positions for super-deep sex!
No matter how much sex you have had, there is still that yearning to have a super-deep sex that will blow your mind and send you to the dreamland.

According to sex therapist, Dr. Ian Kerner, the following are the ways to explore that part of your sex partner that you never knew existed before!

• The caboose: The man is seated, you sit on his lap, facing away from him. Since this may be a new experience for you, it’ll feel like a whole new world down there. This will make the penetration feel deeper than it actually is, Kerner says.

• Scoop me up: Lie side-by-side such that the man is right behind you, bend your knees slightly so that he can enter you from behind. This position works because he has more leverage and support so he can wedge himself in a way that gives maximum depth. This provides for much stimulation here, and it is perfect for when you’re both tired but still want to have sex!

• Seashell: Lie on your back with legs raised up and out. Get your ankles as far back toward your head as you can. Then, he enters in a missionary position. The advantage here is that the legs are spread wide, lending more depth. And because he is riding high, it will give you some clitoral stimulation.

• Butter churner: Lie back in the plow position, ankles on either side of your head. He will squat and dip his penis in and out of you. In this strange, new position, every sensation feels amplified.

• The OM: He sits cross-legged, then you sit on his lap, facing him. Next, wrap your legs around his back, pull each other closer, and rock back and forth. This position is all about opening yourself up—especially your legs and hips.

• Flatiron: Lie face-down, with hips slightly elevated (try sticking a pillow underneath them), and spread legs out straight. The lifted hips offer a low barrier to entry, says Kerner, giving great G-spot stimulation, says Kerner.

• Face-off: He sits down, and you sit in his lap, facing him. And because the legs are wider here, you’re more open to receiving his full length, Kerner says. From here, you’re able to control pace and just how deep you want to go.

• Cowgirl’s helper: You are on top as he lies back, and you push off of him. The twist here is that he assists. By holding your hips or thighs, he supports your weight and rises to meet your thrusts. This gives you some great stimulation. Guys love this position for the view, and you get the chance to dominate. You’re on top as he lies back and you push off of his chest and slide against his thighs. You can open your legs wider for a deeper entrance. This move gives G-spot and clitoral stimulation, which means you’re twice as likely to get off, he says.
