The best time to have sex? 5.48 in the morning
Timing, as the saying goes, is everything. And when it comes to the human body, this couldn’t be truer.

Our ups and downs over a 24-hour period are ruled by our ‘circadian rhythms’ — that is the fluctuations in our hormones, body temperature and blood pressure, all of which govern both our mood and energy levels.

Now, a growing body of scientific research is proving just how significant timing is to our daily emotions, needs and abilities.

Scientists say that male and female sex drives peak at different times of day, and that there is only a small window when both partners are truly in the mood.

Men’s levels of the sex hormone, testosterone, surge during the night, when they are around 25 to 50 per cent higher than normal.

“This is because the pituitary gland, which governs its production, automatically switches on overnight,” scientists say.

A woman, by contrast, has to fight high levels of melatonin (the sleep hormone) in her blood.

Of course, women also have testosterone in their bodies, which boosts sexual desire.

Indeed, a recent study published in the British Medical Journal found that sunlight boosts testosterone by stimulating the hypothalamus (the part of the brain responsible for hormone production). So, the rising sun gets both men and women in the mood.

“Testosterone levels in men and women are highest in the morning,” says sex therapist Geraldine Myers.

“The energy levels of both are highest, too. Mentally, they are less occupied with life’s demands, so it’s the perfect time (for sex).”

As for the exact time most suitable for lovemaking, experts pinpoint 5.48am as the best time for sex.

This is also when couples are most likely to reach orgasm, according to another research by Italian scientists.

The bottom line: Set that alarm.
