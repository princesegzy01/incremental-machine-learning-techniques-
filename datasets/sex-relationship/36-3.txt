Seven steamy sex positions to try tonight!
When did you last try a new sex position? Well, today is Saturday and the day is fast winding down.

To take your relationship to the next level, here are some steaming hot sex positions to try—according to sex experts at Babeland.

Assisted missionary: Put a pillow or two under your butt or under your lower back. This will tilt your pelvis up to better match the natural angle of the penis. This is also nice if you suffer from back pain.

Life on the edge: Lie down on your back at the edge of the bed, with your thighs and legs dangling off. Bend your knees and put your feet on the ground. Your partner stands or kneels between your legs and enters you. Your partner gets a great view and control of a deep thrust. You get to kick back and enjoy.

Butt lift: Put your ankles on your partner’s shoulders. This will lift your butt in the air. Your partner can hold your butt or your legs. Your partner has total control over the thrusting.

Raised doggy: Your partner kneels or stands behind you and enters you. Your thighs can be apart with your partner’s thighs inside yours. If your partner is strong, he can (after penetration) lift and hold one or both of your legs — like a wheelbarrow.

Supported doggy: You kneel by the side of the bed, facing it and spreading your arms against the mattress. Your partner kneels behind you. All the fun of regular doggy, but with solid support.

Tired doggy: You lie face down with one or two pillows under your pelvis, so your butt tilts up. Your partner lies on top of you and enters you from behind with legs either between or outside of yours.

Side roll: Your partner lies on their side, leaning back a little, legs apart. You lie in front, backing onto the penis or dildo. Your thighs are together and resting between your partner’s thighs.
