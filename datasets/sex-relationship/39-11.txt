Woman rapes taxi driver at knife point
A woman has been charged with rape after it was alleged that she sexually assaulted a taxi driver at knife point.

Brittany Carter is alleged to have called for a cab to pick her and accomplices Cory Jackson and an unnamed person from a hotel in Findlay, Ohio, at around 4.25am.

Police said Jackson pulled a knife on the driver and Carter performed a sex act on him.

An indictment said that she ‘purposefully compelled’ the taxi driver to engage in sexual conduct ‘by force or threat of force’.

They then fled after allegedly stealing $32 from the driver’s pocket and warrants were issued for their arrests.

Jackson remains on the run, but Carter was taken into custody for two first-degree felony counts.

The third accomplice is not expected to have charges brought against him, prosecutor Phil Riegle told the Toledo Blade.

Carter had previously been indicted twice on drug charges.

Jackson is wanted for rape, robbery and an unrelated murder charge.
