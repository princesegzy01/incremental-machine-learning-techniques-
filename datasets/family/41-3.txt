Senate adjourns as Senators abandon chamber 
Sunday Aborisade, Abuja

The Senate adjourned plenary abruptly on Thursday when members of the red chamber vacated their seats, leaving a few lawmakers in attendance.

Obviously uncomfortable with the situation, the member representing Benue South Senatorial District, Abba Moro, cited order 10 of the Senate standing rules to draw the attention of the Senate to the development.

He said the number of senators in the chamber were few and obviously could not be said to have formed a quorum, which is supposed to be one -third of the 109 members.

He argued that proceedings should not continue again because the number of senators in the chamber was insignificantly low.

The President of the Senate, however, ruled Moro out of order claiming that that the scanty nature of the chamber did not indicate that the senators in attendance did not form a quorum.

Lawan said the number of senators that signed the attendance register was adequate to form a quorum.

He, nevertheless, explained that the senators who started the plenary but were no longer in the chamber were either in the tea room or toilets.

The Leader of the Senate, Yahaya Abdullahi, apparently in support of the position of Moro, sought the permission of the President of the Senate to adjourn plenary going by the scanty nature of the chamber.

Lawan put the suggestion into a voice vote and the few members in attendance unanimously voted in support and the Senate was subsequently adjourned till Tuesday next week.

Our correspondent observed that the Senate had two more motions to debate upon before the abrupt adjournment.
