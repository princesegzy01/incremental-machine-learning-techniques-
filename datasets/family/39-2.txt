Bangladesh Railways Secretary, Mofazzal Hossain told journalists that three bogies caught fire after the derailment of the intercity train `Rangpur Express’ while crossing Ullapara station in Sirajganj district, 134 km northwest of Dhaka.

“Six compartments and engine of the Rangpur Express veered off the tracks while it was passing through Ullahpara Station at 2:15 p.m. local time, said Hossain.
